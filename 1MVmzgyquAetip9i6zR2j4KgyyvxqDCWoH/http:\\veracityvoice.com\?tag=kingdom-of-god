<p>I wrote about the controversy swirling around the so-called Christian organization World Vision <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F140410&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHOvDhB48vra3CLAz0g_2vD4jHxkg">here</a>.  For those who are unaware of what occurred on March 24, WV <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2Fct%2F2014%2Fmarch-web-only%2Fworld-vision-why-hiring-gay-christians-same-sex-marriage.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPgnNYtXYlNynFNqToTw2WBmfgjQ">announced</a> that they had plans to hire “married” homosexuals.</p>
<p>The backlash was fast and furious. Christian leaders, Roman Catholics, the pro-family movement and others in the faith community made it abundantly clear that they opposed WV’s decision to hire people in counterfeit marriages on the grounds <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">that</span> the Bible teaches <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">that</span> homosexuality’s a sin.  It’s no secret that Bible-believers hold to the teaching that God established the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcarm.org%2Fchristianity%2Fdevotions%2Fmarriage&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4XLryW9om-O8q7R4dd5n330FTrg">marriage</a>sacrament for the purpose of bringing Him glory; thus marriage other than that which He designed does not bring glory and honor to Him. One would assume that WV’s president and board members had an understanding of what the Bible teaches on marriage – but maybe not.</p>
<p>They learn fast, though.  The board noticed a storm brewing when donors began to withdraw their financial support and they quickly changed course.  The public’s reaction was so strong that they reversed their decision faster than greased lightning.</p>
<p>In part 2 we will examine whether or not World Vision’s truly a Christian organization.  I mean, that’s the burning question, isn’t it?   One way to find out is to take a look at its website.  On the homepage they make the claim that they are a,</p>
<p><em>Christian humanitarian organization dedicated to working with children, families, and their communities worldwide to reach their full potential by tackling the causes of poverty and injustice.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps because I’ve spent a number of years exposing false teaching in the Church, likewise the cults and the occult, when I read the phrase “full potential” Anthony Robbins immediately came to mind.  Robbins is one of many Human Potential magnets.  He has taken on the trendy title “life coach.”  The life coach’s aim is to get you to a place where you can tap into your <em>full potential</em>.  Robbins’ beliefs are rooted in the New Thought movement.  (Those who wish to know more about New Thought can do so <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianheadlines.com%2Fnews%2Fvictory-for-religious-hiring-in-world-vision-case.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHSgBad89QXr1KLaaIqki2-kV1RWg">here</a>.)  In essence “Syncretism between Christianity and early New Thought was a hallmark of this movement,” says cult expert Marcia Montenegro.</p>
<p>So &#8211; why would a “Christian humanitarian organization” choose to define itself using anti-Christian language inspired by New Thought rubbish?</p>
<p>Any organization that calls itself Christian should have as its main goal reaching families and communities around the globe with the gospel of Christ.  And if that’s not its stated goal then how is it any different from other secular organizations such as the <em>American Red Cross</em> or the <em>World Food Programme</em>. What sets Christian relief organizations apart from all the others is that they have a biblical mandate to evangelize the lost.  Jesus <em>commanded</em> His followers to:</p>
<p><em>Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation.</em><em> Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.</em>  (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fmark%2F16.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGNRxbpT9bvmJx50XpOmf1hEuq_MA">Mark 16:15-16</a>)</p>
<p>For many years my husband and I sponsored children through WV.  Because it calls itself a Christian organization we just assumed that those in the field would be about the business of providing relief as well as evangelizing lost souls bound for hell.  When it became apparent to us that WV was moving more toward what is deemed a “social justice” organization, we wrote to express our concerns.  No response was forthcoming.  Eventually we stopped sponsoring children through WV and chose another organization.</p>
<p>The social gospel is a <em>false</em> gospel. (Discover more about social justice <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gotquestions.org%2Fsocial-gospel.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCNidz4M__mrIgNaoR--rQt4Fkyw">here</a>.)   What does Scripture tell us about spreading a false gospel?</p>
<p><em>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed. </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fgalatians%2F1.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYGxwgH4jy83VCXRzNONX8DHvTdQ">Galatians 1:6-9</a>)</p>
<p>I fully expect WV’s supporters will want me to demonstrate that WF prohibits proselytizing (sharing the gospel of Christ.)  In the process of researching for this piece I discovered all the proof doubters will need &#8212; and it comes right from the horse’s mouth.   I visited the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fworldvision.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG0srMyBUtvgtCnKcwkbW_XSl7klg">homepage</a>…clicked on <strong>Our-Impact…</strong>clicked on<strong> Faith-in-action </strong>and unearthed their goals and accomplishments:</p>
<p><strong><em>Our faith in Jesus is central to who we are</em></strong><em>, and we follow His example in working alongside the poor and oppressed. We serve every child in need that we possibly can, of any faith, or none. We partner with churches throughout the world, equipping them to meet the needs of their communities.</em></p>
<p>Scroll down the page to <strong>Our Approach </strong>and here’s what you’ll find:</p>
<p><strong>Do You Talk To People About Jesus?</strong></p>
<p><em>In all ways appropriate for a local context, we seek to witness to Christ — through our deeds of love and mercy, the character and conduct of our staff, and through our words of testimony. As we demonstrate the unconditional love of God to others, we are ready to give the reason for the hope within us, but expect people to evaluate the truth of our message <strong>by our actions</strong>.</em></p>
<p><em>God created men and women in His image, giving each of us a free will. Therefore, we respect individuals — including their culture, faith, and beliefs. We respect the dignity and the right of all people to maintain and change their religious beliefs. We seek in every instance to be faithful ambassadors of the good news of Jesus <strong>through our actions</strong> (2 Corinthians 5:20) and hope that our lives will reflect God’s generous love for people, ultimately bringing glory and praise to Him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Do you expect the people you help to share your beliefs?</strong></p>
<p><em>We serve all people, regardless of religion, race, ethnicity, or gender. <strong>We do not proselytize,</strong> and we pledge never to exploit vulnerability to obtain a profession of faith. We do not feed the hungry as a means to an end. We feed the hungry because God cares about people who are hungry, and He wants them to be fed (Psalm 145:13-17).</em></p>
<p><em>Insisting that people hear a certain message or affirm a specific belief as a prerequisite to receiving our assistance violates codes of conduct established for disaster, relief, and humanitarian groups of which we are a member. However, our hope is that <strong>our work and lives</strong> would contribute to people becoming followers of Christ.</em></p>
<p><strong>How does being a Christian organization impact your work?</strong></p>
<p><em>Our faith in Jesus Christ is core to who we are. As an expression of God’s unconditional love for all people, especially vulnerable children, we serve alongside the poor and oppressed. <strong>We hope to live as followers of Christ by being active, visible bearers of God’s love</strong>.</em></p>
<p><em>Relying on God’s grace and Spirit, we affirm the truth of the gospel and our hope in Christ <strong>through our character, speech, actions</strong>, and in the signs of God’s power at work in individual lives, in the communities where we work, and in all creation. </em>(emphasis added &#8211; <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldvision.org%2Four-impact%2Four-faith-in-action&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFsJQSxnVt01AmSQEvgDym4x6GCEg">Source</a>)</p>
<p>By its very words WV is a Christian organization that professes a belief in the gospel.  On its website it states that “Jesus is core of who we are.”  Yet its policy is not to proselytize?</p>
<p>Romans1:16-17 says:</p>
<p><em>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”</em></p>
<p>Instead of sharing the good news with those who are perishing, WV is all about doing “good works.”  Now don’t get me wrong.  I’m not saying Christians shouldn’t do good deeds and be “active, visible bearers of God’s love.”  But good works and sharing Christ with the lost go hand in hand.  <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fromans%2F10.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEfQPG1W0tVzXqufgn_mXOa7Fjikg">Romans 10:17</a> tells us that “Faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.”</p>
<p>In <em>Barnes’ Notes on the Bible</em>, the meaning of “hearing” is explained:</p>
<p><em>When it is said that faith cometh by hearing, it is not meant that all who hear actually believe, for that is not true; but that faith does not exist unless there is a message, or report, to be heard or believed. It cannot come otherwise than by such a message; in other words, unless there is something made known to be believed. And this shows us at once the importance of the message, and the fact that people are converted by the instrumentality of truth, and of truth only. </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fcommentaries%2Fromans%2F10-17.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGIWb52M-gk_flAySDxXTpnY92Qhw">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Just prior to WV doing an about face, Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, slammed the organization over its plans to hire unrepentant homosexuals.  Perhaps his, and articles like it, is the reason Richard Stearns and the board reversed their decision and decided to repent.  The question many people are asking at this juncture is how do we know that the leadership has sincerely repented of their willingness to mollify the radical homosexual lobby’s demand for them to hire gay people?  Time will tell.  However, it’s evident that at least for the time being, board members have decided it’s not in WV’s best interest to go against Bible believers and faith groups because they’re the ones who pay the bills!<br />
I’m out of room so I’ll end with an excerpt from Albert Mohler’s stinging rebuke – before WV repented:</p>
<p><em>Writing to the Corinthian Christians, the Apostle Paul stated: “Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.” [1 Corinthians 6:9-10]</em></p>
<p><em>The leader of World Vision U.S. now claims that the Bible is not sufficiently clear on the sinfulness of same-sex sexuality and relationships, but he also claims a “mission of building the kingdom</em>.”  <em>The Apostle Paul makes homosexuality a kingdom issue, and he does so in the clearest of terms.</em></p>
<p><em>Of course, Paul’s point is not that homosexuals are uniquely sinful, but that all of us are sinners in need of the grace and mercy of God that come to us in the gift of salvation. Thanks be to God, Paul follows those words with these: “And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.” [1 Corinthians 6:11]</em></p>
<p><em>The worst aspect of the World Vision U.S. policy shift is the fact that it will mislead the world about the reality of sin and the urgent need of salvation. Willingly recognizing same-sex marriage and validating openly homosexual employees in their homosexuality is a grave and tragic act that confirms sinners in their sin — and that is an act that violates the gospel of Christ. </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.albertmohler.com%2F2014%2F03%2F25%2Fpointing-to-disaster-the-flawed-moral-vision-of-world-vision%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHvPKHLwaT-fRFzzO7OBGEzbze5aw">Source</a>)</p>

<p>It is possible that like ancient Judah, the United States is destined to come under despotic rule.  Though we do not have Jeremiah to keep us informed (Jeremiah 27) it appears that the wheels of destiny are carrying us in that direction.  It could be that world tyranny is God’s plan for the ultimate advance of His Kingdom.  Our time is temporal while God’s time is eternal.</p>
<p>Jeremiah warned the people of Judah not to resist the Babylonians that it was God’s judgment that caused their captivity and when they resisted they were resisting God.</p>
<p>Recently, a theologically sound Christian brother graciously explained to me why it is evil to “take to the streets” in protest against tyrannical government.</p>
<p>He wrote that God raises up pagan rulers to shame us into repentance and if we repent He raises up Godly rulers.  If a nation fails to repent God keeps it under tyrannical rule or destroys it.  Remedial action involves going to the lesser magistrates – councilmen to mayors, mayors to governors to presidents, etc. &#8211; and thinks taking to the streets is “resisting the ordinance” of God.</p>
<p>He further contends that today’s Christian church is not nearly as bad as it was in the days of Martin Luther and that we should “diplomatically and with love and care” approach church officers to explain our concerns.  If this does not work he believes God will abandon us and raise up another civilization.</p>
<p>When revolutions are successful in overthrowing evil and oppressive regimes, the evil and repressive regime is often replaced by another violent, evil, and repressive regime.  Governments, even evil governments, serve purposes that are necessary to the functioning of society.  In our time the devastating results of revolution are evident in Libya, Syria, and now in the Ukraine. <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2014/02/21/before-and-after-pictures-of-kievs-independence-square-capture-battle-in-ukraine-4313179/" target="_blank">See here</a>.</p>
<p>Revolutionary anarchism seldom produces a superior form of government.  It is often fomented by forces that intend to <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/03/06/looting-ukraine-begun/" target="_blank">impose their own rule</a> on the chaos that results.</p>
<p>In over fifty years of my Christian walk I have approached several ministers with suggestions on improving fidelity to the Will of God.  I have yet to find an ordained minister who will consider suggestions for improvement.  The status of lay persons prevents them from becoming a source of correction.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._W._Tozer" target="_blank">A.W. Tozer</a><a name="0.1__GoBack"></a>, a self-educated Christian minister, described the situation well in his 1955 book “The Root of Righteousness”:  “Churches and Christian organizations have shown a tendency to fall into the same error that destroyed Israel: inability to receive admonition.  After a time of growth and successful labor comes the deadly psychology of self-congratulation.  Success itself becomes the cause of later failure.  The leaders come to accept themselves as the very chosen of God.  They are special objects of divine favor; their success is proof enough that this is so.  They must therefore be right, and anyone who tries to call them to account is instantly written off as an unauthorized meddler who should be ashamed to dare to reprove his betters.”</p>
<p>“If anyone imagines that we are merely playing with words let him approach at random any religious leader and call attention to the weaknesses and sins in his organization.  Such a one will be sure to get the quick brush off, and if he dares to persist he will be confronted with reports and statistics to prove that he is dead wrong and completely out of order.  ‘We be the seed of Abraham’ will be the burden of the defense.  And who would dare find fault with Abraham’s seed?”</p>
<p>Tozer’s description of the plight of the clerisy (1955) seems to verify the condition of the contemporary Christian Church for a period longer than the forty year ministry of Jeremiah.  Attempts, gracious or otherwise, to change church leaders have failed. My experience matches Tozer’s description.</p>
<p>I am afraid we are long past the time when attempting to reach leaders by starting with lessor magistrates can be used as an orderly and effective redemptive procedure.  In his penetrating book “The Soul of the American University” George Marsden chronicles the secularization of our Christian schools of higher learning.  In 1805 Harvard University, initially a Christian institution, elected Henry Ware, a Unitarian, as Hollis Professor of Divinity.  The deterioration of the United States social order began in earnest over two centuries ago.</p>
<p>A perfunctory confrontation to the secularization of higher education took the form of alternative colleges.   In 1808 Andover Theological Seminary was founded and dedicated by charter to be forever committed to orthodox Calvinism.  Yale was founded as an alternative to Harvard.  Slowly all of these institutions succumbed to the popular demand for a secular education.</p>
<p>Men are sinners and the urge to usurp God’s sovereignty is steady and strong.  Antinomianism and Arminianism have been chipping away at sound Christian doctrine since settlers landed on the shores of North America.  The sound doctrines carried to the new world by the Pilgrims and Puritans were resisted by some and challenged by others.  John Wesley’s Methodists brought the heresies of Jacob Arminius and spread them throughout the colonies; Baptists and Congregationalists granted autonomy to individual congregations while Quakers, Lutherans, Episcopalians, Moravians, Catholics and Jews set up churches.  Continuity of Protestant doctrine was lost very early in American history.</p>
<p>Arminianism found fertile ground but it was the scourge of Dispensationalism that effectively declawed the Lion of Judah.  Removing Law from the Christian religion is like removing the heart from a human; it is the core of Christianity.  R. J. Rushdoony claims that those who hate The Law hate God.   The Law reveals the character of the God of the Bible.  When Christian theologians teach free-will they rob God of sovereignty and a god who is not sovereign is not really God at all.  Denominations that teach these two destructive “A”s are really foreign religions.</p>
<p>America has a secular government and its citizens have a secular mindset.  Humanism has invaded our churches.  God’s Law is so far from the thinking of most modern citizens that they consider stoning a guilty individual for breaking a mandate from the Creator of the Universe worse than using weapons of modern warfare to kill hundreds of thousands of innocent human beings all created in God’s image.  The hysterical fear of Sharia law is a reflection of the appraisal of God’s Law.  Fear has fostered unreasonable opinions that have distorted truth and contributed to the detachment from reality that is common in our culture.  We are far down the road from obedience to the God of the Bible.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church of Luther’s day had usurped the use of the sword and sentenced heretics to death.  It was, however, a visible evil that could be confronted as a single entity.  Today, we are faced with scores of more subtle enemies.  The landscape is covered with the dead bodies of religious organizations whose ghosts are still active but useless.</p>
<p>The sad, preplanned deterioration of the United States of America has never been effectively confronted with the true Gospel of Jesus Christ.  Luther confronted the Catholic Church directly forcing decisive action and the Reformation went on to confront the ruling class with the status of God’s Law teaching the people that both they and their rulers are subject to the higher legal standards imposed by The Creator.</p>
<p>Will God discard the United States of America and work with another civilization?  Maybe, but considering that God sent Jonah to Nineveh to announce judgment and then caused the hearts of the people to repent making a liar out of a reluctant Jonah, we need to understand that His actions cannot always be predicted.  God will determine the fate of our nation.  It appears impossible from a human appraisal but prayer and confrontation have accomplished miracles and there is still hope for the miraculous.</p>
<p>Christians are vested with the responsibility of confronted evil with righteousness.  Strident confrontations of sinful behavior properly express the Will of God and should be part of our resistance.  Our God is not a pantywaist. We are to avoid chaos and anarchy but we are to be active in promoting the Kingdom of God against the pervasive kingdom of man.</p>
<p>Without a modern Jeremiah God’s directions must be conveyed through His Word.  Public platforms for the dissemination of information are closely controlled and Christians are not allowed.  The streets may be the only venue available for voicing true Christianity; don’t worry though, there a few Christians willing to take on such a responsibility.</p>
<p>My Christian friend who took issue with “taking to the streets” uses the word “ethics” in reference to “God’s Law”.  He maintains that the meanings are the same.  I believe he is wrong.  Ethics is less offensive and is often used as a secular term whereas God’s Law is specific.  Pulling punches may quell conflict but it is dishonest and breaches God’s injunction to let our yeas be yea and our nays be nay.  R. J. Rushdoony writes, “A true church can suffer in battle, because it confronts the enemy; a false church refuses to battle, because it is at peace with sin and death, and does not know Jesus Christ as Lord.”</p>
<p>There is a time for war and a time for peace.  Christians are losing the war because they refuse to suffer!</p>
<p>I cannot end this essay without including a quote for Rushdoony’s Second Volume of Systematic Theology (Page 967).  This quote describes perfectly our condition and its remedy:</p>
<p>“We are then told, first, that for faithfulness to God’s law, man will be blessed in the weather, the land, and in it harvests (Lev.26:3-5).  Second, there shall be peace, i.e., no danger from enemies external and internal.  This peace goes hand in hand with victory (Lev. 26:6-8).  Third, there will be fruitfulness, i.e., many children, because God’s covenant peace is with them.  They will also have fruitful harvests and an abundance of food (Lev. 26:9-10).  Fourth, God shall dwell among His people to keep them in safety (Lev. 26 11-13.  Fifth, If they are disobedient or faithless, God will curse them.  Terror, plagues, enemies, and more will pursue them, and they will see depopulation (Lev. 26:14-26).  Famine will take its toll.  Sixth, in their continued apostasy, they will be pushed into cannibalism and more.  The Lord will destroy their cities, and their land will be made a desolation.  They will be taken into captivity also.  All this will allow the land to enjoy its Sabbaths as they go into captivity (Lev. 26:27-43.  Seventh, in all of this, God will seek their restoration.  His judgments will be covenant judgments, seeking their return to the law and the covenant (Lev. 26:44-46)”</p>

<p><i>Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.</i> ~ Eph 5:11</p>
<p>Not surprisingly the movie “Son of God” has created quite a stir in the Christian community.  Before I gave the theater my money I read several reviews, blog posts, Facebook comments and viewed TV interviews of husband and wife team Mark Burnett and Roma Downey promoting their film.  Roma is a familiar face to many and is best-known for her role on the successful TV show “Touched by An Angel.”  Mark Burnett is the executive producer of a string of hit TV shows such as &#8220;Survivor,&#8221; &#8220;The Voice, “Celebrity Apprentice,&#8221; &#8220;Shark Tank,&#8221; and he has won several Emmys.</p>
<p>When I first heard that another full-length feature film about the life of Christ was coming to the silver screen, I was skeptical for several reasons.  First, Mark and Roma are <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fproclaimingthegospel.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFC3frvRKIQF9SC4yqvYBlZF-DJFw" target="_blank">Catholic</a> and I was concerned that the movie would be produced from this perspective; a perspective that in many cases I disagree with.</p>
<p>Second, I learned that Roma earned a degree in “spiritual psychology” from the University of Santa Monica, a private graduate school founded by New Age spiritual and self-help quack John-Roger.   P.J. Miller is not being flippant when he asks:</p>
<p><i>What do you call someone who is a student of new age psychology and spiritualism? Do you call them new agers? Do you call them seekers? Would you dare call them Christian? Well, if you’re Roma Downey, then yes, you would call yourself all the above. (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpjmiller.wordpress.com%2F2014%2F02%2F20%2Froma-downey-and-mark-burnetts-son-of-god-film%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFgZWzUvSSuonF-KhRyFE76zVKmtg" target="_blank">Source</a>)</i></p>
<p>Third, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcIXCok9HPg" target="_blank">movie trailer</a> shows Jesus asking Peter to follow Him. Peter looks skeptical and asks Jesus what they’re going to do.  Jesus grins and replies “Change the world.&#8221;  Well, no.  Jesus never said those words to Peter!  Here’s what Jesus actually said:</p>
<p><i>While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.</i><i> And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”<sup><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></sup>Immediately they left their nets and followed him. </i>(Mat 4:18-20)</p>
<p>Jesus <i>commanded</i>  &#8211; Peter and Andrew dropped what they were doing to follow Him.  (More on this in a moment.)  Another clip shows a woman sitting in a boat on the Sea of Galilee with Jesus and the apostles during the storm where Jesus walks on water.  But according to Scripture there was no woman in the boat:</p>
<p><i>Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.  </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fmatthew%2F14.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFQMifrWgBs3o8e0MX5YlB1nLJO6g" target="_blank">Mat 14:22</a>) <i></i></p>
<p>In the movie Mary was the woman in the boat.  But why would they have a woman in the boat when Matthew informs us that the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gotquestions.org%2Ftwelve-apostles-disciples-12.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFHKds39cg97GDWLIkhPjBmgEvhiw" target="_blank">disciples/apostles</a> got into the boat.  Mary wasn’t one of the twelve disciples/apostles – no woman was!</p>
<p>Finally, S. Michael Houdmann revealed in his review of the movie that, “the reason for Jesus&#8217; death and the meaning of His resurrection are completely missing. The fact that Jesus&#8217; death is the atoning sacrifice for sin is not mentioned at all (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblia.com%2Fbible%2Fesv%2F1%2520John%25202.2&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG905IHhqX4ANXW8h2rFEl3ybcB-A" target="_blank">1 John 2:2</a>).”</p>
<p>As I said, “Son of God” has elicited a great deal of controversy as did Mark and Roma’s “<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.history.com%2Fshows%2Fthe-bible%2Fvideos%3Fmkwid%3DsSPL82MEx%257Cc_pcrid_38422039518_pkw_the%2520bible%2520miniseries_pmt_b%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_term%3Dthe%2520bible%2520miniseries%26utm_campaign%3DG_The%2BBible%26paidlink%3D1%26cmpid%3DPaidSearch_google_G_The%2BBible_&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFELoDt1jPlNQ5AsvmarGeUJWHSSA" target="_blank">The Bible</a>” miniseries produced by <i>LightWorkers Media</i>, a company owned by them. This “<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunnyshell.org%2F2013%2F03%2Fhistory-channels-bible-exalts-man-over_4.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNENGZsv0GJfi2VStlvgqd5IX4qefA" target="_blank">heretical and blasphemous</a>” program aired on the History Channel last year. &#8220;We knew when we were shooting,” said Downey, “that the Jesus portion of our &#8216;Bible&#8217; series was special and we shot much more footage and we&#8217;ve re-edited many more scenes into a stand-alone feature film called &#8216;Son of God.&#8217;&#8221;   I don’t have the space to tackle the “The Bible” brouhaha.  I will say, though, that several highly controversial pastors sat on the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbibleseriesresources.com%2Fboard-of-advisors&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF58IDJY5UUlo7Sr0ZN7tr0PkvRnQ" target="_blank">Board of Advisors</a>.

<p><b>The Son of God?</b></p>
<p>“Son of God” opened on February 28, so by now a lot of folks have had the opportunity to view it in theatres and many more will have it streaming into their living rooms in a few months.  Naturally, reviews were quickly written, some good, some not so good.  (You’ll find links to the reviews at the end of this piece.) Suffice to say that in a short amount of time a lot has been said about the film.</p>
<p>Many of you won’t be surprised to learn that Mark and Roma asked Saddleback Church founder Rick Warren to help spread their version of the “good news.”   He happily agreed.  “I&#8217;ve seen most of the films produced about Jesus in the past 50 years,” said the pastor, “and ‘Son of God’ is the best.  We&#8217;re excited Jesus is back on the big screen, and we&#8217;re going to fill the theaters. I want every other faith leader in America to do the same.”</p>
<p>So – why would the man who is affectionately called “America’s Pastor” agree to promote a film that its critics describe as outright unbiblical?</p>
<p>Not only did Warren endorse the film, according to the <em>Baptist Standard</em> staff report :</p>
<p>Pastor and author Rick Warren partnered with LifeWay Christian Resources to release a Bible study related to the <em>Son of God</em> movie from 20th Century Fox, which hits theaters Feb. 28.</p>
<p>The small-group curriculum resource by Warren, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifeway.com%2FProduct%2Fson-of-god-the-life-of-jesus-in-you-leader-kit-p005683781&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcgHScltwfKoVSrmkrNSALmULXSA" target="_blank"><em>Son of God: The Life of Jesus in You</em></a>, is a companion piece to the movie produced by husband-and-wife team Mark Burnett and Roma Downey.</p>
<p>The six-session study features video clips from the movie and videos from Warren explaining Jesus’ teachings and their impact on people’s lives. Topics include baptism, temptation, suffering, death, resurrection and ministry. (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.baptiststandard.com%2Fnews%2Fbaptist%2F16135-baptist-briefs-son-of-god-film-study-materials&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFe5Hn8F-yRqcWl1o5LUyhycE_kmA" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>As a Southern Baptist preacher, Rick Warren knows perfectly well that the Roman Catholic Church holds to the view that it is the one true Church.  Thus, any church outside the RCC is anathematized (excommunicated, cursed or damned). The Protestant Reformers held the view that the RCC’s gospel is not a gospel that saves; therefore the RCC is apostate.  Anyone who rejects the true gospel – we are saved by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone – is an unbeliever.  Period.  Warren also knows what the Bible teaches regarding believers going into <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F110124&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHiF_q_2AwTLQ4sDLs1yW7u9WlT7Q" target="_blank">partnerships with unbelievers</a>:</p>
<p><i>Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness.</i> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F2_corinthians%2F6.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMAY0VmYFOOkoqEQo2lwys2YH5dQ" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>)</p>
<p>Here’s the thing.  Not everyone who professes the name of Christ has a true saving faith.  What about Mark Burnett and Roma Downey?  Do they have a true saving faith?  Let’s examine the fruit.</p>
<p><b>Endorsements</b></p>
<p>Popular pastor and author Mark Driscoll’s church bought out 3,500 seats.  In 2013 he and his wife shared a stage with Mark and Roma at Resurgence 13.  Driscoll later remarked:</p>
<p><i>We watched the world premier trailer for</i><em> </em><i><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonofgodmovie.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-fkG9dZ52XXs5GpGYJ54MvuRECQ" target="_blank">The Son of God</a> at the conference, and the footage choked me up as I thought of the millions of people who will hear about Jesus through this project. I am so encouraged by God’s work through this couple. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftheresurgence.com%2F2013%2F11%2F07%2Fson-of-god-mark-burnett-roma-downey-at-r13&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5IaLbzfvROoRWgJK81bKNGWfuYA" target="_blank">Source</a>)<i></i></p>
<p>God’s work?</p>
<p><i>The connection between the Passover sacrifice (Exodus 12) and Jesus as the Lamb of God (</i><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblia.com%2Fbible%2Fesv%2FJohn%25201.29&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNETeolXbTfLhDRdYfRa0yM6E5HHPQ" target="_blank"><i>John 1:29</i></a><i>) is not made. The fact that Jesus&#8217; resurrection proves His victory over death and sin and guarantees a resurrected eternal life for all who believe in Him (1 Corinthians 15) is nowhere to be found.  &#8211; </i>S. Michael Houdmann</p>
<p>Another endorser of the film was “Social Justice Christian” Rev. Jim Wallis.  In my column <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F120911&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIE-sMLkZMpVsz_lvVUBF_fHl0fA" target="_blank">Liberalism created the culture of evil and death, part 3</a> I wrote:</p>
<p><i>This man wears many hats.  He is the founder of Sojourner’s Magazine, speaker, author and activist.  He’s also President Obama’s “spiritual advisor.”  This alone speaks volumes.  Rev. Wallis insists that he’s an evangelical Christian even though he has abandoned the biblical gospel for the “social gospel.”  He believes he’s on a mission from God to assist the poor and oppressed to bring forth the Kingdom of God on earth. </i></p>
<p>When this purveyor of the false social justice gospel was asked for advice by the couple, he gladly gave it to them:</p>
<p><i>What won me over to the whole series was the clip about Jesus meeting Peter, the fisherman. In a Washington, D.C., premiere of “The Bible” series a few weeks ago, I had wonderful conversations with Mark and Roma. Mark asked me if they were right to have Jesus say that he wanted to change the world. Those words are not literally in the scriptures, but it seemed to him and Roma that’s exactly what Jesus was talking about. Absolutely correct, I told them both. And we went through the first few chapters of Mathew which demonstrate that truth. I love the clarity and courage of the statement from Jesus in “The Bible.”</i></p>
<p>Sunny Shell disagrees:</p>
<p><i>Christ came into the world to save sinners from the righteous wrath of God, which is the just penalty for our sins. He never said He came to change the world. He said He came to transform people by giving them new hearts and new minds through repentance and faith in Christ alone. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunnyshell.org%2F2014%2F02%2Fmovie-review-son-of-god-is-most.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF602M-mwbXh5wlSVWozEG6U1sNzQ" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>The <i>Examiner</i> listed the names of churches and organizations that distributed tickets for a so-called &#8220;Theater Take-Over&#8221;:</p>
<p><strong><i>Joel Osteen</i></strong><i>, pastor of Lakewood Church in Houston, Tex., who is distributing 8,000 tickets donated by an anonymous donor; <strong>Jerry Falwell</strong>, Jr., of Liberty University which has more than 12,000 students; <strong>Craig Groeschel</strong> of LifeChurch which has 18 campuses in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma; Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles with over four million members and Miles McPherson of the Rock Church with weekly attendance of more than 10,000 in San Diego, Calif.</i> (Emphasis in original - <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.examiner.com%2Farticle%2Frick-warren-son-of-god-best-movie-of-jesus-50-years&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFU_NyUVASLjKJekDa5tfeSfhWwKw" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>
<p>In an article that appeared on <i>Fox News</i>, Mark and Roma wrote:</p>
<p><i>In all our combined years in the entertainment industry, we’ve never seen anything like this kind of grass-roots support for a project. It is truly miraculous.</i></p>
<p><i>So, too, is the unprecedented depth and breadth of those who have endorsed the film. Pastors like Rick, as well as scholars and faith organizations, have graciously supported our effort to share this story of our Savior – though they belong to different denominations, adhere to varying theological doctrine, worship God in their own unique ways. </i></p>
<p><i>Bishop T.D. Jakes of The Potter’s House in Dallas said “the audience will be enthralled, encouraged and inspired.” </i></p>
<p>S. Michael Houdmann was not enthralled by the movie.  In his review he writes:</p>
<p><i>The Son of God presents a Jewish Messiah who is crucified, dies, comes back to life, and commissions His followers to spread the word. But why did He have to die? What is the meaning of the resurrection? What is the message the apostles were supposed to proclaim, and why was it worth dying for? <b></b></i></p>
<p>More from the <i>Fox News</i> article…</p>
<p><i>Joel Osteen of Lakewood Church in Houston called it “an epic work that touches the heart.”</i></p>
<p><i>The Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles Jose Gomez says it’s “a very important movie because it gives us the opportunity to realize God’s presence in our own lives.”</i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fopinion%2F2014%2F02%2F27%2Fson-god-miraculous-journey-to-big-screen%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-smuaswla4b1ygxCikRAo3i46Xw" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Certainly there are by now “Church leaders” that are sincerely shocked to find out that they endorsed a movie produced by New Age Catholics.  Here’s more proof from a 2010 article <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbecksmithhollywood.com%2F2009%2F04%2Froma-downey-happy-out-of-spotlight%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_oBUaRK962PgJULO81uMLpLoLuw" target="_blank">Roma Downey Happy Out of the Spotlight</a> that shows she’s an advocate of New Age/New Thought spirituality:</p>
<p><i>Says Roma, who lives in Malibu, ‘My kids go to school about a 40-minute drive away. I’m open to the group’s opinion about what we listen to on the way there. On the way back, I get my own selections — books on tape by Eckhart Tolle, Tony Robbins…My husband says I’m so self-realized I’m practically levitating.’</i></p>
<p>For those who are unfamiliar with Eckhart Tolle, he’s a New Ager.  A few years ago Tolle paired up with <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F120507&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNExBXarCqOHwN2-lSGzbTk6euqV8A" target="_blank">Oprah Winfrey</a> to do 10 online classes on XM Satellite radio on his blockbuster book “A New Earth: Are You Ready to Be Awakened.”  Oprah and Tolle took participants through his book chapter by chapter.  Regrettably, a large number of professing Christians took the class!</p>

<p>Well, it’s apparent that Roma, who says she loves the Bible, is unaware—or doesn’t care&#8211;that God says consulting a medium is evil.</p>
<p>Later she collaborated with Edwards by providing a CD to accompany a book he wrote:</p>
<p><i>Roma prays the entire rosary</i><i> on the beautiful CD that comes along with this book. It’s quite lovely and gives you the special opportunity and a unique spiritual closeness to Roma to be able to pray right along with her as if she was right there at your side.”</i> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdavemosher.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F03%2F06%2Froma-downeys-comments-and-connections-with-psychic-medium-john-edward-show-she-is-not-a-christian-as-she-claims-but-a-new-ager%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFvRX_2PmQgJ6HjxzeL4MTWIkJ4Q" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>So now you know a bit about two New Age gurus Roma Downey looks forward to listening to each day and an occultist she collaborated with.  The worldview of these men is as far from Christianity as the Earth is from Pluto.</p>
<p>P.J. Miller sat listening to Jim Bakker introduce Mark and Roma on Bakker’s TV show and recalled “their previous work on the History Channel’s The Bible and how they managed to literally re-write the Bible itself, and presented another gospel message altogether. I was captured by their … aggressive but subtle attempt to portray themselves as ‘believers’.  The sappy spiritual love fest that permeated on set showed me that something was indeed changing within Christianity, and that something was another Jesus being introduced to the masses.”</p>
<p><i>Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe it.</i><i> For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fmatthew%2F24.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGAUYRr8l_vl0ukuYfMAByj5ZPIRw" target="_blank">Mat/ 24: 23-24</a>)</p>
<p>After several weeks of due diligence I’ve decided that “Son of God” is not a film I wish to see.  In addition to the concerns I have included in this article, my research has turned up many more &#8212; way too many to incorporate here.  Most troubling is the astonishing lack of discernment shown by some of our so-called Christian leaders.  The Son of God I serve is best described in the Bible which is the inerrant, infallible, inspired Word of God.  Inspired means that God moved through the writers to convey to those who read it the words He wanted us to hear.  So to change the words that Christ spoke is prideful and wicked.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that those who are unfamiliar with the biblical Jesus and see this film will not come away with a clear understanding of His mission here on Earth.</p>
<p><i>He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F1_john%2F2.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFadypSTjyThkBi-zCJpgrDYPqWQg" target="_blank">1John 2:2</a>)<i></i></p>

<p>It’s starting to appear as if marijuana users have become the homosexual lobby of the chemically dependent. What do I mean? <i>Duck Dynasty’s</i> Phil Robertson could mention one sexual behavior (adultery) as disqualifying someone from the “kingdom of God,” but mentioning that “other” sexual behavior? That’s a boycottin’, pardner! Likewise, there’s no shortage of articles about the perils of smoking tobacco — about how it causes lung cancer, emphysema and premature aging; about how it’s a dirty, nasty habit — all without indignant smokers crawling out of the woodwork to protest, between hacking coughs, that their passion is being unfairly demonized. But dare imply that inhaling copious amounts of marijuana smoke may not be one of Dr. Oz’s top ten health recommendations, and, well, the potheads cometh.</p>
<p>Let’s begin here with a simple but apparently radical premise: habitually sucking into your lungs hot gases containing carbon particles probably isn’t the most healthful practice. This is true whether the source is a Marlboro, a truck’s tailpipe or a bong loaded with cannabis. Agreed?</p>
<p>Apparently not. As with <a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/daily-pot-tied-age-first-psychotic-episode-155332322.html">this</a> article about pot use’s correlation with psychotic behavior, such assertions not only bring out the potheads — who do seem to have the ambition to defend their vice — but also some apologists who claim that marijuana smoking is actually a good. It’s for medicinal purposes, you see.</p>
<p>So we hear about how negative reporting on pot is all Puritan propaganda, about how tobacco is far worse, about how <i>I’m 49 and toked since I were a teen and I funkshun fein</i>, about how if you purge the THC, it’s a perfect drug (somehow every pothead is Linus Pauling). And then there’s the old standby: alcohol is legal and is worse. Alcohol is more addictive. Alcohol this and alcohol that. Potheads love the alcohol comparison. Okay, then, let’s compare the two.</p>
<p>While most agree that casual drinking — one or two drinks — is fine and may even offer health benefits, it’s universally acknowledged that drunkenness is destructive, ugly and reckless. In accordance with the old PSA, “If you have to drink to be social, it’s not social drinking,” it’s accepted that if you have to get inebriated to deal with life, you have a problem. Even drunkards tend to acknowledge this (they just usually deny that <i>they</i> have a problem). And we certainly shouldn’t exercise double standards.</p>
<p>So I’ll say that if you want to have one or two small puffs of a marijuana cigarette, fine.</p>
<p>But you’ve crossed the line if you get high.</p>
<p>Deal?</p>
<p>This puts the lie to the alcohol/pot comparison. There are millions of casual drinkers who may have a beer or glass of wine with dinner but have no intention of getting tipsy. Except, however, for the few who use pot for legitimate medical purposes (and I’m dubious about the necessity of this, mind you), the goal of a marijuana smoker is <i>ever and always</i> to get high (drunk). The intention is always to alter his mental state.</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>This is why the proper comparison is not pot smoking and “drinking,” but pot smoking and drunkenness. It is why legal marijuana doesn’t correspond to legal alcohol as much as it does to legal cocaine, another drug that takes you from sober to stewed with one dose.</p>
<p>And it’s why there’s no such thing in the real world as “casual” marijuana use. Millions of “drinkers” can honestly say that they have no chemical dependency issue, but not one regular pot user can. By definition, pot smokers’ goal is to get “drunk.”</p>
<p>So one drink doesn’t equal one joint — one bottle does. But to further cement the point, imagine alcohol really was pot’s equivalent, that even just one six-ounce drink got you plastered. Would we find any degree of alcohol consumption tolerable? Would Prohibition ever have ended?</p>
<p>Note here what I am not doing. I’m not making any claims about whether pot is more unhealthful than tobacco; I’m not denying that a pothead is a safer driver than a drunkard, or opining on whether or not marijuana use increases the incidence of psychosis or lowers I.Q. when used by the young (as another study indicated). I’m not weighing in right now on whether or not the drug should be legal. I’m simply pointing out that the main arguments used to legitimize pot are pap.</p>
<p>And “legitimize” is the operative word. When people editorialized against Prohibition, their argument perhaps was of the nature G.K. Chesterton presented in a 1935 radio talk when he opined, “The free man owns himself. He can damage himself with either eating or drinking; he can ruin himself with gambling. If he does he is certainly a damn fool, and he might possibly be a damned soul; but if he may not, he is not a free man any more than a dog.” But I don’t know of anyone who claimed that drunkenness should be considered a desired state or even acceptable. Yet this notion runs through pro-pot commentary: the idea that potheads’ form of drunkenness is okay. And it has to run through it — because, again, to advocate pot use is to advocate “drunkenness.”</p>
<p>So while we may argue about whether pot is a gateway drug, advocacy of it is certainly a gateway idea. Inherent in it is the notion that altering your mind is okay, getting high is fine. Of course, some potheads might tell us that their form of drunkenness is different, that the acceptance of it won’t lead to the acceptance of getting high via other means. Hey, all these things occur in a bubble, there is no slippery slope, and precedents don’t precede. (And where have we heard that before?)</p>
<p>Wherever you stand on pot legalization, about legitimization there should be no debate. A nation that does not maintain stringent social prohibitions (in the least) against chemical dependency will not likely remain strong and vibrant. Thus, we always must be able to unabashedly say: if you’re using marijuana habitually, face it, you’re a pothead. You’re self-medicating. You’re chemically dependent. You have a problem. And drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son.</p>
<p>This is true whether it’s by bottle or bong.</p>

				<p>December 20, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=19462#comments" title="Comment on Homosexual Mafia Gets Duck Dy-Nasty"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="19462 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=19462">1 Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>When I saw the headline yesterday about how “Duck Dynasty” patriarch Phil Robertson had commented on a certain sexuality-defined group, I wondered how long it would be before he got the “treatment.”</p>
<p>I saw the <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/duck-dynastys-phil-robertson-indefinite-666808">next headline</a> no more than a few hours later.</p>
<p>In case you haven’t heard, the faith-filled Louisianan wound up in hot water after being asked what was sinful by a <i>GQ</i> interviewer and offering the following answer, as <a href="http://www.gq.com/entertainment/television/201401/duck-dynasty-phil-robertson?currentPage=2">presented</a> by the magazine:</p>
<p>“Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men,” he says. Then he paraphrases Corinthians: “Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers — they won’t inherit the kingdom of God.”</p>
<p>Can you guess which of the above groups caused what subsequently befell Robertson: suspension from his <i>A&amp;E</i> show?</p>
<p>It wasn’t the greedy.</p>
<p>Or the idolaters.</p>
<p>It wasn’t bestialists, though there’s an <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timstanley/100108943/the-gay-rights-movement-has-emboldened-americas-bestiality-advocates/">effort</a> to legitimize their behavior now, too.</p>
<p>The swindlers?</p>
<p>Nope — not the slanderers, either.</p>
<p>Hint: One of the organizations whose complaints got Robertson suspended was GLAAD, and that doesn’t stand for Guiding Light Advocates for Adulterers and Drunkards.</p>
<p>Of course, we all know the answer. GLAAD characterized Robertson’s comments as vile and “extreme,” and now he joins Dr. Laura Schlessinger and others whose careers were hobbled by the Velvet Mafia.</p>
<p>This is probably where I’m expected to ask, “Where’s freedom of speech?” or whine about how the left should respect the other side’s beliefs. But this would ignore reality, which is that every civilization has its “values.” And as someone once pointed out, stigmas are the corollaries of values; if we’re going to value certain things, it follows that what contradicts or condemns them will be de-valued.</p>
<p>People who don’t understand this will utter refrains such as “I don’t care what you do in your private life, just don’t shove it in my face,” as if something can be completely de-stigmatized but then, somehow, remain in the closet. Those who do grasp it, however, might say something such as what homosexual activists Hunter Madsen and Marshall Kirk wrote in their book <em>After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the 90’s</em><em>. They said that once homosexuality was normalized, </em>those who would “still feel compelled” to oppose it would be “cow[ed] and silence[d]…as far as possible” and that if homosexual activists can “produce a major realignment solidly in favour of gay rights, the intransigents (like the racists of twenty years ago) will eventually be effectively silenced by both law and polite society.” And what do we see 20 years later? Criticism of homosexuality will get overseas Westerners punished through law and Americans punished through social pressure.</p>
<p>How’s that tolerance workin’ for ya’?</p>
<p>“Tolerance,” as it has been marketed, was always a con. Aristotle said that “[t]olerance is the last virtue of a dying society,” but it’s also the vice that kills it. And it so often is a vice because it’s generally misunderstood. For one thing, tolerance <i>always</i> implies a negative, real or perceived; you wouldn’t have to tolerate a beautiful car or a delectable meal — you relish those things. But you might have to tolerate a cold or bad weather. Thus, tolerance is only noble in two situations: One is when dealing with something objectively negative that cannot be eliminated, such as irremediable pain. The other is when confronted with something you don’t happen to like and could avoid, but that is objectively good or neutral; an example would be tolerating a food you detest in order to avoid offending your hosts.</p>
<p>So while we might admire a person who can bear a cross with a stiff upper lip, what if he abides a negative he needn’t put up with? He then is either a doormat or a masochist.</p>
<p>That’s us.</p>
<p>The doormat, that is.</p>
<p>This brings us back to that modernistic “I don’t care…just don’t shove it in my face” attitude. This is a pipe dream and the first step toward degradation and tyranny; it is a false Americanism. As John Wesley said, “What one generation tolerates, the next generation will embrace.” And once this happens it is ridiculous to wonder why the thing in question is out of the closet; accepted things by definition always will be. At this point those with an affinity for it will take the next step: marketing.</p>
<p>This is precisely what Madsen and Kirk prescribed with respect to homosexuality, writing that Americans needed to be desensitized to the behavior via a “continuous flood of gay-related <em>advertising</em>,” a “conversion of the average American’s emotions, mind, and will, through a planned psychological attack, in the form of propaganda fed to the nation via the media.” Madsen, mind you, was a marketing man by trade.</p>
<p>And when this marketing is successful enough and the newly exalted product is considered a <i>good</i>, what will that which condemns it be considered? This is how good becomes bad, bad becomes good, and those conned into being tolerant come to be seen as intolerable (I discuss this in-depth <a href="http://selwynduke.typepad.com/selwyndukecom/2013/06/the-acceptance-con.html">here</a>).</p>
<p>And thus is Christianity being suppressed. Make no mistake, the concept of sin is central to Christianity — and sexual sin is part of that centrality. Lust, correctly defined as disordered sexual desire, is one of the Seven Deadly Sins. So saying you cannot talk about sexual sin — in its entirety — is to say you cannot talk about Christianity in its entirety. And this is part of the process of relegating Christianity to the closet.</p>
<p>This tolerance trap is why Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen <a href="http://www.northamericanmartyrs.org/pdf/Plea-for-Intolerance.pdf">wrote</a> in 1931:</p>
<p>America, it is said, is suffering from intolerance — it is not. It is suffering from tolerance. Tolerance of right and wrong, truth and error, virtue and evil, Christ and chaos. Our country is not nearly so overrun with the bigoted as it is overrun with the broadminded.</p>
<p>…Tolerance is an attitude of reasoned patience toward evil, and a forbearance that restrains us from showing anger or inflicting punishment. …Architects are as intolerant about sand as foundations for skyscrapers as doctors are intolerant about germs in their laboratories….</p>
<p>Tolerance does not apply to truth or principles. About these things we must be intolerant, and for this kind of intolerance, so much needed to rouse us from sentimental gush, I make a plea. Intolerance of this kind is the foundation of all stability.<i></i></p>
<p>Our culture war is a fight to the death. The barbarians are inside the gate, and they don’t listen to reason. Show them the same tolerance they show you — and then show them the door. In the case of <i>A&amp;E</i>, what should happen is that they be boycotted till brought to their knees.</p>
<p><i>To their knees</i>.</p>
<p>Unless we can rediscover virtue and muster total intolerance for the intolerable, our decline will be inexorable.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/CopCrop3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/CopCrop2.jpg" align="left" /></a><span>Libertarianism has become popular.  But is it really the answer to the despotic regimes that have characterized the history of human society?  Some who claim the name are close but many are far into utopian fantasies.</span></p>
<p><span>I like Lou Rockwell.  His internet page is always a source of truth and commendable prose. I saved a quote where he said that the “moral law applies across the board, and that one is not exempted from it by a government suit.”  That is a good starting point as long as the source of the moral law is the Word of the Christian Triune God.  Unfortunately, God’s Law is rarely, if ever, mentioned in Libertarian circles.</span><span>   </span></p>
<p><span>Most Libertarians are pedagogic, articulate, intellectual, and industrious; they have no peers in chronicling the swift deterioration of our nation.  Their primary moral code is that coercion is evil and freedom is righteous.  Most envision a society f<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=VHWSrdSFq2I" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">ree from restraints</span></a> where everyone considers the rights of their fellows. Their objective is attractive and though its realization is murky and imprecise their ranks are growing.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span>Libertarianism</span></span></a><span> has roots in the Godless intellectualism of the Enlightenment.  Seventeenth Century French intellectual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Rene Descartes</span></a> declared   “I think, therefore I am”. Deification of the human mind began the tragic and irrational march toward human divinity.  Thomas Paine called it “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Reason" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Age of Reason</span></a>” and with the irreverence of a rebel and the brilliance of an intellectual he discarded the formal religion of the ages in favor of his own deistic opinions.</span></p>
<p><span>Intellectualism spawned the Enlightenment and like its progenitor Libertarianism is steeped in intellectualism.  Free trade ala <a href="http://mises.org/liberal/ch3sec7.asp" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ludwig von Mises</span></a> takes on an almost divine character.  The fractured condition of the movement provides insight into the results of the deification of the human mind.</span></p>
<p><span>Libertarian ranks include Liberals, Conservatives, Paleo-Conservatives, Anarchists, Minarchists, limited government rebels, mislead Christians, freedom loving intellectuals, and rebellious youth.  There are Socialist Libertarians and Capitalist Libertarians.  European definitions tend to be anarchic and politically left while American definitions are broader supporting free market capitalism.  All tend to resist coercion and emphasize freedom, liberty, and voluntary association.  There are moral Libertarians and immoral Libertarians.  There are Koch Libertarians and Rockwell Libertarians.  As with many Godless intellectual movements there is a wide acceptance of free sex.</span></p>
<p><span>Former Congressman Ron Paul has done as much as anyone to popularize the Libertarian Movement. His run for the Presidency was filled with wisdom and honesty that would serve us well but his defeat was programmed before he began his campaign.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Peter Theil</span></a>, an openly gay member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/investor_peter_thiel_is_the_billionaire_behind_ron_paul_s_presidential_campaign_.single.html#pagebreak_anchor_2" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">provided major support</span></a>.  I voted for Ron Paul and thought his financing was a result of large quantities of small contributions from internet sources.  I now wonder if it was a setup to insure the election of Barak Obama.</span></p>
<p><span>Libertarianism lacks an anchor and is plagued with the anarchy of human opinion.  When organizations become fractured by opposing opinions they become weak through diversity.  Power results from a clear objective.  There are too many voices in the movement. In a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-libertarianism-fails-2012-12" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Business Insider article</span></a> Eric Zuesse writes that Libertarians “entirely avoid the real question, which is: What type of government is good? As an “ideology,” libertarianism doesn’t even make it to first base: it’s fake, from the get-go. That’s why libertarianism fails.”</span></p>
<p><span>Allegiance to God’s overarching legal system provides an anchor and a big step forward for freedom. Opinions are a form of coercion with each proponent striving to dominate.  Anthony Wile at the Daily Bell recently posted a fascinating interview with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gilder" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">George Guilder</span></a>.  Guilder is a consummate insider who lost his father to WWII and was parented by David Rockefeller.  Some of Guilder’s opinions are compatible with patriots, new world order opponents, and some Libertarians.  <a href="http://thedailybell.com/28485/Anthony-Wile-George-Gilder-on-His-New-Book-the-Superiority-of-Ludwig-Von-Mises-and-the-Necessity-for-a-Regulatory-Jubilee" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The interview is here</span></a>.   It is an interesting interview of a very smart man.  However, I am not as much interested in the interview itself as I am with the demeanor of Gilder’s responses. He responds with the assurance of the wealthy elite and Wile accepts his responses with the demeanor of the proletariat.  Though they are just opinions Gilder expects them to be heeded; there is tyranny in his manner.  An interview with Walter Block provides another example of dominate opinion.  Block has the lofty credentials of an academic. He expects respect for his positions but with less dominance.  <a href="http://lewrockwell.com/block/block213.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Read his interview here</span></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Rejection of the Christian doctrine of original sin undergirds scores of disastrous social and political ventures. The government of the United States of America was founded and has been conducted under the assumption that government is a human domain.  We live in a Democratic Republic which depends on the voting public to elect individuals who will abide by a Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span>God provided Commandments, not opinions.  Commandments are authoritative and dominating, they demand compliance.  Opinions vary from man to man and are subject to rejections.  Commandments vest authority in God while opinions vest authority in the creature.  One is God centered, the other is humanistic.  God’s Commandments are simple and immutable; human law is voluminous, complex, emendable, and often obtuse.</span></p>
<p><span>The United States Constitution is a man made document that is being shredded by men and women who have taken a sacred oath to uphold it.  These are evil, dishonest people.  This kind of behavior is typical of the majority of kings, queens, and dictators that have enslaved and abused the earth’s population from antediluvian times.  It would create severe problems in an anarchic Libertarian society.</span></p>
<p><span>Absolute freedom is like infinity, it is beyond the kin of mankind.  We are captives in a body and captives in a universe.  We had nothing to do with our birth and baring suicide we have little to do with our death. Our inclination is to fall into a captivity of action that imprisons our lives.  Some of us become obsessed with business, some with learning, some with drugs, some with sex, some with ego, etc.  A mature person in a properly governed society should be free to choose where he will use his life.</span></p>
<p><span>Al Benson began one of his recent columns with this paragraph: “We see in operation today two kingdoms in the world—the Kingdom of God and the kingdom of man (the state). There are few legitimate governments anymore that really comprise the “state.” Most of the legitimate ones are gone, having been replaced with dictatorships, oligarchies, or fake “republics” that fool people with charades they refer to as elections and whose results have already been predetermined long before the “election” takes place. We recently had one of those in the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span>The human freedom being pursued by the Libertarian agenda is at war with the Kingdom of God and in spite of its popularity it cannot realize its objective. Freedom is rooted in Christianity.  It is rooted in individual responsibility and obedience to God’s Commandments.  God’s government is the opposite of the new world order; His government is decentralized. The family is the basic unit.  The state acts as protector and the church is God’s agent.</span></p>
<p><span>The universal application of Law is the key to freedom.  All of society; the individual, the church, and the state, must abide by God’s Law.  Government cannot be allowed to pass laws to which they, themselves, are not subject; it always ends in tyranny.</span></p>
<p><span>Christians have been living in a dream world and the next few months and years may bring a big change in their religious perception.  God’s Judgment has fallen on our world!   R. J. Rushdoony wrote that “the Moloch state is a product of apostasy.”  We are in the grip of a product of apostasy that is abolishing our freedom and conducting a war against God and His people.  Hobby Lobby is resisting the new health care law which demands support for abortion.  The Moloch state will require a massive daily fine for non-compliance.  The state does not worship the Christian God of Hobby Lobby; its god is the anti-Christ.</span></p>
<p><span>Hundreds of thousands of Dispensational Christians are expecting world government to bring the Rapture and the Second Coming of Christ.  It could happen but it is likely it will not.  If they are wrong they will be shocked to find themselves living in a police state run by an evil cabal that hates their Savior.  The dictionary defines apostasy as abandonment of a previous loyalty.  We have abandoned the orthodox Reformed Christian Faith that was bequeathed by our fathers and followed a heresy that has allowed the humanistic hand of evil to invade our religion, our lives, our homes, and our nation.</span></p>
<p><span>As the horrors of the new world order afflict the Western World people will realize that government is not the source redemption.  They will concede that we have not followed the gift of salvation with obedience and dominion; and that if we <a href="http://www.covenantnews.com/cronkrite091116.htm" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">expect to live in freedom</span></a> again we must turn from our sin and repent of our wicked ways.</span></p>
<p><span>Christians often quote 2 Chronicles 7:14 where God promises to remove His judgment “If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.”.   I get many emails quoting this Bible passage but none of them specify what is meant by turning from our wicked ways.   God’s judgment is not confined to abortion or to homosexuality or to disobeying the often questionable personal guidance that comes from God “speaking to” individuals.  Judgment comes for disobedience to His Commandments (His Law).</span></p>
<p><span>We have lost our nation to Moloch because we have allowed a foreign religion to change our laws legalizing the evils of abortion, homosexuality, murder, dishonesty, theft, injustice, war, genocide, hate, pugnacity, greed, torture and independence.   When a society allows its government to disobey God’s Law that society is on the road to ruin.</span></p>
<p><span>Freedom is not realized by abandoning government and allowing moral evil to run rampant, it is not a product of a lack of laws, nor can it be produced by intellectual endeavor.  Freedom is a result of obedience to the Commandments of our Creator.  Libertarians put the rational product of their minds above the Law of God.  They are not the only ones who believe their opinions are superior to God’s. Our society is full of legal standards, folkways, and mores that are at odds with God.  We are living in a cesspool created by our own vain laxity and many have not yet smelled the stench.</span></p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/candles-prayer-vigil3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/candles-prayer-vigil2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>During the 2012 election, the New Religious Right (NRR) held prayer vigils all throughout the United States. Their rallying cry: “If my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.” 2 Chronicles 7:14</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with Christians gathering together to pray for a common cause.  There is nothing wrong with asking God to return our country to biblical principles for the simple reason that those of us who profess Christ believe that there’s something diabolical going on, and our country is in the grip of evil.  The way we see it, spiritual forces of wickedness have invaded virtually every aspect of society.  And this reality is what drives us to our knees to plead with God to intervene on our behalf.  As the election drew close, we appealed to the Creator to spare us from an administration that aims to transform America into a socialist utopia.</p>
<p>Even though large groups of conservatives from many religious systems joined together and prayed their brains out, God did not spare America.</p>
<p>What struck me as odd is that many professing Christians met in large groups to pray with people that reject the God of the Bible even knowing that those from other religious faiths do not pray to the God of Christianity. So the purpose for praying with unbelievers is….?</p>
<p>Now consider this. The Bible teaches that anyone who is not born again is <i>not</i> indwelled by the Holy Spirit.  I tackled this subject in “Are you praying to the only true God”:</p>
<p><i>Scripture speaks of God the Holy Spirit residing within all who believe in the Son of God. The Spirit guides, instructs and empowers believers. (John 14:16-17) As well, the &#8220;Spirit of truth&#8221; confirms everything about Jesus. (John 15:26) The unregenerate (unsaved) person is not Spirit filled. God does not hear anyone&#8217;s prayer unless it is put into words by the Holy Spirit. So if we want our prayers to be heard and answered we must pray to the right God. </i>(<a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/mwest/100512" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Paul drives home the point in 1 Timothy 2:5:</p>
<p><i>For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.</i></p>
<p>As mediator, Jesus Christ stands between God and men to reconcile man to God.  According to Scripture, God does not hear the prayers of the unrepentant sinner. “Sin had made a quarrel between us and God; Jesus Christ is the Mediator who makes peace.”</p>
<p>Returning to the election, Albert Mohler believes it was <a href="http://www.albertmohler.com/2012/11/07/aftermath-lessons-from-the-2012-election/" target="_blank">a &#8220;catastrophe&#8221; and a &#8220;disaster&#8221;</a> for evangelicals. He said in a <i>New York Times</i> interview:</p>
<p><i>It&#8217;s not that our message—we think abortion is wrong, we think same-sex marriage is wrong—didn&#8217;t get out. It did get out.  It&#8217;s that the entire moral landscape has changed. An increasingly secularized America understands our positions, and has rejected them.</i></p>
<p>Perhaps the NRR leaders should put their priorities in order and do what the Bible commands.  First and foremost followers of Jesus Christ must share the Good News of the Gospel with the lost.  (<a href="http://kingjbible.com/1_corinthians/15.htm" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>, Mark 16:15) We may defeat the evils of our day through political means and we may change laws. But unless man’s sinful heart is changed, evil will persist.</p>
<p>We must also oppose the evolutionary secularist worldview.  Many pro-family groups have been in the trenches for decades, fighting to “take back America for God.”  It has been an up-hill battle &#8212; and expensive to boot.  But let’s be honest; in spite of all our efforts and the money we’ve poured into winning the culture war, liberals are winning!</p>
<p>After months of pleading with God to oust Obama, we’re now asking, “Why did God allow his re-election?”</p>
<p>In a word: Judgment.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, the question we should be asking ourselves is, “Why is God judging America?”</p>
<p>Again, in a word: Sin.</p>
<p>When I was a child and disobeyed my parents I got a spanking.  But before the boom was lowered I’d cry out, “Don’t spank me! I’ll be good, I promise!” All the pleading in the world did not work with my parents. They’d give me a licking because I deserved one.</p>
<p>Well, America is getting a licking because we deserve one. It would seem that God has closed his ears to our pleas and stale promises. <i>We the Peeps</i> have not repented of our sins and turned from our wicked ways.  In fact, most Americans could care less what God thinks of their lascivious behavior.  So for now, at least, God will allow us to continue wallowing in filth.</p>
<p>I believe one of the reasons God has turned us over to a reprobate mind, to do what should not be done (<a href="http://kingjbible.com/romans/1.htm" target="_blank">Rom. 1:28</a>) is that, like the world, the visible Church is awash in sin.  A whole host of self-professed Christians are deep in sin simply because they have no clear understanding of what God deems sinful &#8212; and they have no desire to find out!</p>
<p>Satan uses syncretism to separate God from His people.  Religious syncretism is the blending of differing systems of belief.  “Syncretism relies on the whim of man, not the standard of Scripture.”  Syncretism in Protestantism occurred when elements of other religious beliefs were integrated into mainstream denominations. So, what’s the big deal?</p>
<p>The big deal is blending historic Christianity with other philosophies!  Listen to Deuteronomy 12:29-31:</p>
<p><i>When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land; Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise. Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.</i></p>
<p>The LORD was not kidding around.</p>
<p>Syncretism slithered into the Church through liberalism.  But well intended evangelical conservatives who make up a large part of pro-family groups are also responsible.  In their desperation to “bring America back to God” groups such as the American Family Association, Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council, Americans for Working Families, Wall Builders, Traditional Values Coalition, Liberty Council and Concerned Women for America reached out to a slew of controversial Christians (<a href="http://kingjbible.com/2_peter/2.htm" target="_blank">false teachers</a>), including men and women in theological cults!  And they’re routinely invited to participate in spiritual and political endeavors &#8212; even prayer rallies!</p>
<p>Over the years religious renegades have shared the platform with GOP candidates, congressmen, entertainers, heads of pro-family groups, and other conservative superstars.  Now, I’m not saying that people on stage with renegades share their beliefs; what I’m saying is that when highly regarded leaders unite with heretics and cultists, the public sees it as an endorsement!</p>
<p>“If the New Religious Right were truly committed first and foremost to sound biblical theology and doctrine,” says Brannon Howse, “they would not be involved in spiritual enterprises with those who participate in the New Age Movement, the New Apostolic Reformation, ecumenicalism, globalism, communitarianism, the Church of Rome, the Word of Faith movement, social justice, and the social gospel.”</p>
<p>As Brannon rightly pointed out, the <a href="http://www.emailbrigade.com/306.html" target="_blank">Word of Faith movement</a> is not committed to sound biblical doctrine. What they teach is heretical!</p>
<p>Here CRI exposes word-faith teaching:</p>
<p><i>God created man in &#8220;God&#8217;s class,&#8221; as &#8220;little gods,&#8221; with the potential to exercise what they refer to as the &#8220;God-kind of faith&#8221; in calling things into existence and living in prosperity and success as sovereign beings. Of course, we forfeited this opportunity by rebelling against God in the Garden and taking upon ourselves Satan&#8217;s nature. To correct this situation, Jesus Christ became a man, died spiritually (thus taking upon Himself Satan&#8217;s nature), went to hell, was &#8220;born again,&#8221; rose from the dead with God&#8217;s nature again, and then sent the Holy Spirit so that the incarnation could be duplicated in believers, thus fulfilling their calling to be what they call &#8220;little gods.&#8221; Since we&#8217;re called to experience this kind of life now, we should be successful in virtually every area of our lives. To be in debt, then, or be sick, or (as is even taught by the faith teachers) to be left by one&#8217;s spouse, simply means that you don&#8217;t have enough faith — or you have some secret sin in your life, because if you didn&#8217;t, you would be able to handle all of these problems.</i></p>
<p>Further&#8230;</p>
<p><i>In every instance, the &#8220;Word-Faith&#8221; teaching is guilty of presenting an inflated view of man and a deflated view of God, thereby compromising God&#8217;s message as revealed in the Bible. This fast-growing movement has disastrous implications and, in fact, reduces Jesus Christ to a means to an end — when in fact he is the end. If the New Age Movement is the greatest threat to the church from without, &#8220;positive confession&#8221; may well be its greatest threat from within.</i> (<a href="http://www.equip.org/perspectives/word-faith-what-s-wrong-with-the-word-faith-movement" target="_blank">Online source</a>)</p>
<p>Another movement mentioned by Brannon Howse is the <a href="http://www.emailbrigade.com/307.html" target="_blank">New Apostolic Reformation</a> (NAR).  The NAR, aka dominionists, hold that God is restoring the lost offices of church governance, namely the offices of Prophet and Apostle.  The leaders fancy themselves modern-day apostles and prophets and believe they have the same gifts as the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament apostles.  In a piece I wrote entitled “Dominionists are on the move…and they mean business” I brought to light some of their unbiblical beliefs:</p>
<p><i>The NAR/dominionist&#8217;s goal is to transform society into the kingdom of God on earth. How? By controlling various aspects of society. The term they use is the &#8220;Seven Mountains,&#8221; or &#8220;Seven Spheres&#8221; of society. The Seven Mountains are: 1) Arts and Entertainment; 2) Business/Economy; 3) Education; 4) Family; 5) Government; 6) Media; 7) Religion. The NAR holds that as they accomplish ridding the world of evil, things will get better and better and then Jesus Christ will return to set up His kingdom.</i></p>
<p>The goals of the CR [Christian Right] and the NAR seem like a good idea, right? I mean, who could argue with wanting to influence the seven spheres of society that are dominated by secular humanists. Christians are not wrong in desiring to have a society based on Judeo-Christian principles. But here&#8217;s the problem. This &#8220;mandate&#8221; the NAR mob subscribes to did not come from the Lord Jesus Christ. In John 18:36 Jesus made it clear: &#8220;My kingdom is not of this world.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, dominionists never let a little thing like what Jesus said get in the way of their lofty goals. One of the most troubling aspects of their &#8220;theology&#8221; is the unbiblical teaching on spiritual warfare. They believe they have a kingdom mandate to do &#8220;strategic-level spiritual warfare&#8221; which is &#8220;a popular charismatic method of casting out demons from geographical locations or territories. It identifies three levels of demonic control on earth. Firstly, are &#8220;Ground-Level&#8221; demons, which possess people. Secondly, &#8220;Occult-Level&#8221; demons empower witches, shamans, magicians. Finally, &#8220;Strategic-Level&#8221; demons which are the most powerful of the three, are said to rule over certain regions or territories. Their main purpose is to hinder people from coming to Christ.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Hence, dominionists go hither and yon to do strategic-level spiritual warfare to tear down demonic strongholds established by Satan and his demons. This is not local; it&#8217;s global. </i>(<a href="http://www.emailbrigade.com/343.html" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that the word-faith/positive confession movement and the NAR have many of the same heretical beliefs.  In Matthew 7:15-17, Jesus warned:</p>
<p><i>Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep&#8217;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. You shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree brings forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit. … Therefore by their fruits you shall know them.</i></p>
<p>In Ephesians 5:11 Paul tells us to &#8220;have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them.&#8221;  We are not only to expose them, we are to call them what they are – evil!  We have many examples in the Bible of name calling. For example, in Matthew 23 Jesus called the scribes and Pharisees hypocrites and “whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people’s bones.”  He called these same men serpents and a brood of vipers, looked them squarely in the face and said, “how are you to escape being sentenced to hell?”</p>
<p>But instead of exposing unfruitful works of darkness as we are commanded to do, New Religious Right leaders, many of whom profess Christ, organize prayer events with them!</p>
<p>So &#8211; did God hear those prayers?  Consider who He hears according to Scripture and draw your own conclusion.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/televangalists3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/televangalists2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>By far the biggest obstacle the Church faces is the infiltration of ubiquitous, aggressive liberals, many of whom are renowned pastors, authors, conference speakers, missionaries, televangelists, radio hosts, and CEOs of Christian organizations.  As of late, even some of our most beloved evangelical leaders appear to be morphing into theological liberals.  The extent of movement to liberal ideology varies with each individual, but in certain cases they have gone completely off the rails. False doctrine abounds in books, Bible studies and Bibles authored by notable Christians and promoted by so-called Christian publishers and book sellers.  We have been duly warned about this sort of thing happening:</p>
<p><em>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils</em> (<a href="http://kingjbible.com/1_timothy/4.htm" target="_blank">1 Tim. 4:1</a>).</p>
<p>That, brothers and sisters, is a pretty severe warning!</p>
<p>MARXIST CHRISTIANITY</p>
<p>To give readers a sense of what kind of person to be on the lookout for let me introduce one of the most dangerous wolves in Christendom, the <a href="http://www.crossroad.to/Quotes/spirituality/lighthousetrails/010/6-wallis.htm" target="_blank">Rev. Jim Wallis</a>.  This man wears many hats.  He is the founder of Sojourner’s Magazine, speaker, author and activist.  He’s also President Obama’s “spiritual advisor.”  This alone speaks volumes.  Rev. Wallis insists that he’s an evangelical Christian even though he has abandoned thebiblical gospel for the “social gospel.”  He believes he’s on a mission from God to assist the poor and oppressed to bring forth the Kingdom of God on earth.</p>
<p>David Noebel sheds light on some of the good reverend’s activities:</p>
<p><em>Wallis’ Sojourners enterprise has been a radical, socialistic undertaking from the start. Frontpage Magazine (March 17, 2009) says, “As one of its first acts, Sojourners formed a commune in the Washington, D.C., neighborhood of Southern Columbia Heights, where members shared their finances and participated in various activist campaigns that centered on attacking the U.S. foreign policy, denouncing American ‘imperialism,’ and extolling Marxist revolutionary movements in the Third World.”</em>(<a href="http://thechristianworldview.com/tcwblog/archives/2053" target="_blank">Source</a>)<em></em></p>
<p>Jim Wallis is also a champion of unbiblical movements such as the <a href="http://www.emailbrigade.com/303.html" target="_blank">Emergent Church</a>, <a href="http://www.emailbrigade.com/305.html" target="_blank">Spiritual Formation (contemplative prayer/mysticism</a>) and what he refers to as “<a href="http://www.emailbrigade.com/307.html" target="_blank">spirituality</a>.”  Here is his view of prayer:</p>
<p><em>I pray, but there are many understandings about prayer. For many, prayer is talking to God, sometimes a great list of requests and needs—sort of like a child’s Christmas list mailed to Santa Claus. But at least for me, prayer is becoming a time of listening rather than talking. There is so much noise in our world and our lives (much of our own making); prayer becomes a quiet space that enables us to stop talking long enough to see what God might be trying to say to us.</em></p>
<p><em>The disciplines of prayer, silence, and contemplation as practiced by the monastics and mystics are precisely that—stopping the noise, slowing down, and becoming still so that God can break through all our activity and noise to speak to us. Prayer serves to put all parts of our lives in God’s presence, reminding us how holy our humanity really is. (The Great Awakening: Seven Ways To Change The World, 290) </em>(<a href="http://apprising.org/2010/05/05/reverend-jim-wallis-practices-corrupt-contemplative-spirituality/" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Wallis is promoting unbiblical <a href="http://emailbrigade.com/305.html" target="_blank">contemplative/centering prayer</a>.<em></em></p>
<p>On homosexuality he believes:</p>
<p><em>[T]</em><em>he major differences of theology and biblical interpretation in the church with regard to issues such as the nature of homosexuality, gay marriage, and ordination are not issues that should be allowed to divide the churches<strong> –</strong> that local churches should lead the way here, and that an honest, open, respectful, and, hopefully, loving dialogue should characterize the church on these very controversial questions.</em>(<a href="http://sojo.net/blogs/2011/05/09/statement-sojourners-mission-and-lgbtq-issues" target="_blank">Source</a>)<em></em></p>
<p>Issues which are clearly unbiblical, such as the sin of homosexuality, should not be allowed to divide us? Really?</p>
<p>Are professing followers of Jesus Christ supposed to ignore the Bible’s explicit teaching on marriage, one man and one woman for life, so that men can marry men?  Should we really go against what God says in His Word regarding His plan for sexuality and marriage and adopt a “pro-gay” theology to accommodate a small group of gays and lesbians?  The answer is “May it never be! Rather, let God be found true, though every man be found a liar, as it is written, ‘That Thou mightiest be justified in Thy words, And mightiest prevail when Thou art judged.’” (<a href="http://kingjbible.com/romans/3.htm" target="_blank">Romans 3:4</a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p>Going against God is folly!  (For the biblical view of homosexuality read <a href="http://www.equip.org/articles/answering-the-gay-christian-position/?msource=EC120803WKLY" target="_blank">Answering the Gay Christian Position</a>)</p>
<p>Even though Wallis is a <a href="http://www.worldviewweekend.com/worldview-times/article.php?articleid=5457" target="_blank">Red-Letter Christian</a> and a <a href="http://truthwithsnares.org/2012/06/17/wild-geese-ii-wild-goose-festival-in-nc-june-21st-25th-2012/" target="_blank">Wild Goose</a> chaser, he poses as an evangelical.  Sadly, he and his ilk have many starry-eyed, misguided followers who, like most liberals, wish to farm out their obligations to the tax payers.</p>
<div>
<p>Liberals such as Jim Wallis dub themselves “progressive Christians” and more recently “social justice Christians” (SJC).  Social justice has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it?  But hold your horses!  SJC has its roots in communism and has the same aim: The common good.</p>
<p>Sounds magnanimous, doesn’t it?  Don’t be fooled!  What these people are striving for is government transfer of wealth from one group of citizens to another to level the playing field.  Some liberals use Genesis 4:9 “I am my brother’s keeper” to make their case.  Leftist hypocrites have no problem quoting Scripture to defend wealth redistribution, but when conservative Christians quote Scripture to defend their opposition to abortion, homosexuality, same-sex marriage, and so forth they cry foul!</p>
<p>In an essay entitled “A Biblical View of Social Justice,” John Wheaton writes:</p>
<p><em>[I]t is essential that Christians clearly define what social justice entails. On its face, the term has a positive connotation that conveys a seemingly strong sense of virtue and morality. Basing a claim on an appeal to “social justice” provides the claim holder with a degree of persuasive advantage – a kind of moral blessing on his or her political, theological, or social ideas.  However, social justice involves much more than a superficial label or feelings of compassion. It must involve a clear understanding and delineation of each social problem, the root cause of the problem, and the best solution for the problem. In short, “Good justice requires good judgment.”</em>(<a href="http://thechristianworldview.com/tcwblog/archives/741" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>For SJCs, Christianity is a lifestyle.  Their morality comes, not from Scripture, but from popular opinion. Although they believe that some things in the scriptures are true, the Bible doesn’t hold a place of authority in their lives.  As one blogger put it, “the emphasis is more on growth thru the process of work and serving others.”  In other words, a person must have faith <em>plus</em> he/she must do good “works” in order to be saved. This teaching is demonstrably <em>unbiblical</em>.  &#8220;For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: <span style="color: #001320;"> </span><strong>Not of works</strong>, lest any man should boast. (<a href="http://kingjbible.com/ephesians/2-8.htm" target="_blank">Eph. 2:8, 9</a>) (Bold added)</p>
<p>Many SJCs are Darwinian evolutionists, environmental extremists (save the planet, not souls), and they think nothing of co-mingling Christianity with paganism gleaned largely from Eastern mysticism.  They are supposedly Christians, yet many of them support abortion, the normalization of homosexuality, and same-sex “marriage.” What is most telling is their denial of basic biblical doctrines such as the inerrancy of Scripture; the substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ as God’s judgment for sin; Hell; and Jesus Christ as the only way to God and instead hold to collective salvation – all roads lead to God (<a href="http://www.theopedia.com/Pluralism" target="_blank">religious pluralism</a>).</p>
<p>What it all boils down to is that many SJCs are cultural Christians.  They are not regenerate (born again) believers.  In fact, they are hostile to the true gospel. Moreover, their goal is the redefinition of traditional Christianity.</p>
<p>Liberal wolves are spreading a false gospel or what Peter called “damnable heresies.” (<a href="http://kingjbible.com/2_peter/2.htm" target="_blank">2 Peter 2:1–2</a>)  In a word, <em>evil</em>.</p>
<p>WOLVES IN THE HEN HOUSE</p>

<p>SPIRITUAL DISCERNMENT…ON THE WANE</p>
<p>Spiritual discernment is almost becoming nonexistent in the visible Church.  So &#8211; what exactly is spiritual discernment?  Pastor and Bible expositor John MacArthur defines it thusly:</p>
<p>In its simplest definition, discernment is nothing more than the ability to decide between truth and error, right and wrong. Discernment is the process of making careful distinctions in our thinking about truth. In other words, the ability to think with discernment is synonymous with an ability to think biblically.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/First%20Thessalonians%205.21-22" target="_blank">First Thessalonians 5:21-22</a> teaches that it is the responsibility of every Christian to be discerning: &#8220;But examine everything carefully; hold fast to that which is good; abstain from every form of evil.&#8221; The apostle John issues a similar warning when he says, &#8220;Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world&#8221; (<a href="http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/1%20John%204.1" target="_blank">1 John 4:1</a>). According to the New Testament, discernment is not optional for the believer-it is required.</em></p>
<p><em>The key to living an uncompromising life lies in one&#8217;s ability to exercise discernment in every area of his or her life. For example, failure to distinguish between truth and error leaves the Christian subject to all manner of false teaching. False teaching then leads to an unbiblical mindset, which results in unfruitful and disobedient living-a certain recipe for compromise. </em>(<a href="http://www.gty.org/resources/articles/A314" target="_blank">Source</a>)<em></em></p>
<p>In an article entitled <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/mwest/120220" target="_blank">Got Meat?</a> I offered some advice on how to avoid the pitfalls of compromise:</p>
<p><em>[It is] important to learn what someone really believes about God. A discerning Christian will pick up on the deception. Always find out what a professing Christian believes about Jesus. Is He the Second Person of the Holy Trinity, as orthodox Christians believe? Is He the Son of God? The Savior of the world? If someone’s view of God is radically different from what the Bible teaches, that person is not a Christian!</em></p>
<p>Had followers of Jesus Christ exercised spiritual discernment, perhaps what my friend <a href="http://apprising.org/" target="_blank">Ken Silva</a> refers to as the apostasy-palooza would never have gotten a foothold in the Church &#8212; and the wolves in sheep’s clothing would be considerably less threatening to the Body of Christ than they are today.</p>
<p>I’ll close with this reminder:</p>
<p><em>Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.</em> (Acts 20: 31)</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Facebook-1984-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Facebook-1984-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>Ever since my first of seven trips to Israel Palestine, I begin every day wondering what would Dorothy Day report today regarding USA policy vis-à-vis Israel Palestine?</p>
<p>I have no doubt that Day would be praying for and reporting on two particular brothers born of different Jewish mothers –one Moroccan and the other South American.</p>
<p>In 1963, Vanunu’s family planned on moving to “the land of milk and honey” but were banished to the ethnically cleansed village of Beersheba, which had been envisioned to be a part of the Arab state in the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. Following the declaration of Israel&#8217;s independence, the Egyptian army amassed its forces in Beersheba as a strategic and logistical base but in October 1948, Israeli Forces conquered the city.</p>
<p>Ro’i Tov was born in South America but grew up in a tight-knit communist kibbutz along the Jordan Valley. Against the odds, he graduated from Tel Aviv University and also the Weizmann Institute of Science.</p>
<p>Tov’s second book, <em>The Cross of Bethlehem II: Back in Bethlehem</em> shares “how he was caught between staying steadfast in his Christian faith and remaining obedient to his country’s military. Caught in a military that challenges his spiritual and moral beliefs, Tov achieved the rank of captain while serving in the IDF. When he left Israel and threatened to disclose the details of what he’s witnessed to the world, Tov became a refugee, traveling to Thailand, China, the United States and Bolivia, where he became first a refugee, and afterwards a political prisoner.”</p>
<p>For decades Tov has been monitored, followed, trapped, poisoned and brutally beaten to get him to shut up, and although he has been silenced from speaking in public due to the damage inflicted upon his throat he cannot be silenced on the Internet or on printed page, because he is driven to share the story of his soul.</p>
<p>Regarding the ongoing violence against him, Tov explained:</p>
<p>&#8220;You could ask why I wasn’t assassinated during the 2009 attack. The attack was predicted. I told Bolivia’s refugees office that I was about to be attacked already in March, four months before the violent event. They laughed at me; understandably so since the Bolivian government was a side to the attack. I asked for help from my congregation. They denied it, despite my request not being financial; they have been bought by the aggressors. Since the attack was predicted I took precautions. Substantially before it, I asked for political asylum in Iran. They got copies of all my documents. They have copies of documents I don’t have anymore. This is what saved my life. I was treated by them seriously and even met the ambassador. Neither Israel nor Bolivia knows what would have happened following a successful assassination. As far as they know, Iran may come out and credibly have denounced the crime. Instead, they inflicted a slowly killing wound.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another email Roy wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t have a Facebook account, because after I  opened one, it was deactivated in less than two hours. This is not a coincidence. Victor Ostrovsky disclosed the  fact that American Jews are used by Mossad as &#8216;sayanim,&#8217; (&#8216;helpers&#8217; in Hebrew, the word bears connotations of &#8216;traitors&#8217; as well).</p>
<p>Previously Roy wrote:</p>
<p>“Is Zuckerberg Mossad?</p>
<p>&#8220;I care very little about Mark Zuckerberg’s formal statistics; he was born – at least in spirit – in 1984. On September 2010, he gave an interview to the Oprah Winfrey Show. Among other things he suggested not to talk about politics or religion.</p>
<p>“Politics can be defined as ‘the peaceful solution of conflicts.’ The only alternative to politics is violence and war. Religion defines ones attitude toward God and his fellow humans. As such religion is the base for our politics. There is no other choice for each one of us to be actively involved in both. Any other claim takes us straight into the criminal hands of the Big Brother; then, every year would become 1984.”</p>
<p>In <em>The Cross of Bethlehem</em>, Roy explained:</p>
<p>&#8220;The year was 1983, but at school we were already studying Orwell’s 1984, a book which frightened us by its similarity to life in Israel. The Lebanon War, which had begun a year earlier, was still called ‘the War for the Peace of Galilee’ by the government. The Hebrew possessive contraction brought together the two words which sounded exactly like ‘War-Peace,’ creating a perfect Orwellian oxymoron. We all skipped the obvious contemporaneous context of the book in our commentaries; such semantics could belong only to the enemy and we lived in an enlightened society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our government could not have made such an Orwellian choice consciously. And yet a little voice in my head told a different story, one that must be kept to myself. The glitch allowing such a subversive book to be on our reading list could only be interpreted as some inconsistency of the system.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, a frightening alternative explanation was that <em>1984</em> had been placed on the Education Ministry&#8217;s official list of books intentionally, so that we would forever fear authority and behave. It was our first lesson in government manipulation of its people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orwell&#8217;s nightmare titled, &#8220;1984&#8243; was published in 1949. When I reread it a few years ago, I was struck at how much Vanunu reminded me of Winston Smith, Orwell&#8217;s man with an independent thought that Big Brother found so threatening that they tortured him beyond his endurance in order to break him, brainwash him and strip him of his humanity.</p>
<p>In 1987, from Ashkelon Prison, Vanunu wrote:  I had no choice. I&#8217;m a little man, a citizen, one of the people, but I&#8217;ll do what I have to. I&#8217;ve heard the voice of my conscience and there&#8217;s nowhere to hide…yes, it&#8217;s there all right. I&#8217;m all right. I do see the monster. I&#8217;m part of the system. I signed this form. Only now I am reading the rest of it. This bolt is part of a bomb. This bolt is me…Who else knows? Who has seen? Who has heard?&#8221; [1]   &#8221;   A working prophet, is able to see deeper than most of us into the human soul. Orwell in 1948 understood that despite the Axis defeat, the will to fascism had not gone away…the irresistible human addiction to power were already long in place…the means of surveillance in Winston Smith&#8217;s era…are primitive next to the wonders of computer technology…most notably the Internet.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p>&#8220;Universal peace and justice are the goals of man, and the prophets have faith that in spite of all errors and sins…[and] although under the illusion of fighting for peace and democracy…all the fighting nations lost moral considerations…the unlimited destruction of civilian populations…atomic bombs…can human nature be changed so that man will forget his longing for freedom, dignity, integrity, love-can man forget that he is human?&#8221; [3]</p>
<p>The Orwellian named &#8220;Fabric of Life Road&#8221; in occupied Palestine is in reality an apartheid road; separate and unequal. Palestinians must travel through sewage and tunnels, but Israelis ride on only well maintained contiguous highways. On The Wall that divides Jerusalem from her sister city the little town of Bethlehem, the Ministry of Tourism had draped a doublespeak sign that proclaimed &#8220;Peace be with you&#8221; but there is no peace in the Holy Land, for Justice has not been done unto the indigenous people.</p>
<p>In Orwell&#8217;s epic, Winston Smith played the role of the archetype of all threats to Big Brother; an individual with an open and free mind, independent thought, memory of history, a voice of dissent and willing to take bold action. Orwell&#8217;s Big Brother tortured all threats in order to get inside their head and then to brainwash them into accepting doublethink as truth.</p>
<p>The atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki cannot compare to the 21st century slaughter that could be achieved by thermonuclear weapons with capacities to wipe out 100% of a country within minutes. The Industrial Military Complex cranks out new weapons about every five years and soon the minds driven mad with doublethink-&#8221;war is peace&#8221;- will create 100 or 1,000 megaton bombs!</p>
<p>&#8220;Orwell demonstrates the illusion of the assumption that democracy can continue to exist in a world preparing for nuclear war…leaders…have only one aim, and that is power…and power means to inflict unlimited pain and suffering to another human being……how can a minority of one be right?&#8230;we spend a considerable part of our income and energy in building thermonuclear weapons, and close our minds to the fact that they might go off and destroy one third or one half of our population and that of the enemy…another example of doublethink-from a Christian standpoint&#8221; is the evil of killing any other. [Ibid]</p>
<p>From emails Vanunu wrote between March 24-27, 2008:</p>
<p>&#8220;Court hearing postponed to May 13, 2008-the appeal against 6 month prison sentence for speaking to foreign media. I found out about the change a few days before Easter, but not until Easter Day, did I learn about the day for the next hearing. My lawyer and prosecutor want to move it to different day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the hearing was postponed because, from the beginning of the trial until now, they really don&#8217;t know what they want. All was a game to try to put me under new pressure to see if they can gain something by holding me here…</p>
<p>&#8220;All this means is that Israel just continues what they have done since my release in 2004, delaying and holding me here…instead of sending me for real freedom…they want me very poor and angry, but I am surviving…One thing is very clear: my case is over. They should let me go free…There is a lot of suffering here…Israel wants to hide so much because it is not good for its image as a democracy and a friend of America…</p>
<p>&#8220;1984, yes I read it many times and many years ago. 1984 is here now…&#8221;</p>
<p>Tov continues:</p>
<p>&#8220;In The Cross of Bethlehem I describe two technologies transfers to Israel, which I saw from very close. The one from America cost me my earthly life; I became a refugee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given this background, the life story of Mark Zuckerberg looks slightly different from what mainstream media claims. He was born into a Jewish family; his compromise to Judaism was so big that he had a Bar Mitzvah at the age of 13. Don’t laugh at this; this isn’t just a familiar event with good food. A Bar Mitzvah is the formal acceptance of Judaism from those born into Jewish families. It isn’t a familiar obligation, but an act of choice. Growing up in a Communist Kibbutz, I must tell that only a minority of its kids chose to participate in such a questionable event. Yet, Mark was happy to participate.</p>
<p>&#8220;That means Mark Zuckerberg was in an excellent position to become a formal ‘sayan’ of the Mossad. Did he become one? Let’s see. He entered Harvard, and violated its computers, robbing an important database. He belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi, a Jewish fraternity. Then, Harvard students Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of intentionally making them believe he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com (later called ConnectU); in such a way, Mark Zuckerberg stole the technology that allowed him to build Facebook.</p>
<p>&#8220;One could claim that Mossad wanted to get formal access HarvardConnection.com technology. It is useful for monitoring and controlling social networks, as I recently discovered after opening a Facebook account. Spotting Zuckerberg as a cooperative individual wasn’t hard. Giving him an informal tip on how to break into Harvard’s computers was even easier. Explaining him how to trick out the technology from Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra – none of them would have cooperated with Mossad – was also easy. Afterwards, the marketing of Facebook against other social media networks was easy due to the Harvard connection, everybody wanted to share the splendor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facts speak for themselves: Zuckerberg stole technology in a method not unknown to Mossad. It belongs to the most faithful recruitment base of that organization. Let me ask you, Mr. Zuckerberg: are you Mossad?&#8221; [4]</p>
<p>I doubt Roy will ever receive a reply but I am well acquainted with Zionist trolls all over the Internet and the primary reason I was Primary Administrator of the Facebook Cause: <a href="http://www.causes.com/causes/523841-free-mordechai-vanunu">Free Mordechai Vanunu</a> [currently with <a href="http://www.causes.com/causes/523841-free-mordechai-vanunu/members">5,417 MEMBERS </a>] was precisely to send a message to Israel that the World would not ignore or forget Vanunu.</p>

<p>On July 28, 2011, Tov’s lawyer wrote:</p>
<p>“Roy, have a look at this report of what a UN torture investigation agency is doing for a US soldier in solitary confinement here:</p>
<p>“The United Nations is investigating a complaint on behalf of Bradley Manning that he is being mistreated while held since May in US Marine Corps custody pending trial. The army private is charged with the unauthorized use and disclosure of classified information, material related to the WikiLeaks, and faces a court martial sometime in 2011.</p>
<p>“The office of Manfred Nowak, special rapporteur on torture based in Geneva, received the complaint from a Manning supporter; his office confirmed that it was being looked into. Manning&#8217;s supporters say that he is in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day; this could be construed as a form of torture. This month visitors reported that his mental and physical health was deteriorating.</p>
<p>“I would make sense to make a similar complaint to the UN about your Bolivia treatment. I was unaware that the UN investigated individual human rights cases. The one above concerns solitary confinement in a US prison… The fact that the UN is helping 1 man does not mean they will help all…”</p>

<p>Roy added:</p>
<p>&#8220;In The Cross of Bethlehem II there is one chapter dedicated to  Mordechai Vanunu, a true hero of our era. I expand there on the  reasons for his and our persecution.</p>
<p>&#8220;On three other central chapters in  the book I expand on what he has described as &#8216;psychological torture,&#8217;  but I prefer to call &#8216;psychological warfare.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Roy concluded, &#8220;In another show of the  pettiness and ungodliness of its culture, Israel won’t allow the  rise—or even respect their basic human rights —of any of its own  preaching for the Lord. One advantage People of God have is their capability to rejoice in the Kingdom of God, where &#8216;there shall be no  more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be anymore pain&#8217; (Revelations 21:4).</p>
<p>&#8220;I have faith we both will emerge  victorious out of our respective tests and enjoy the best coffee in the universe at Celestial Jerusalem. My prayers are for him and all other victims of evil.&#8221; ###</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Jeffersonstatue3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Jeffersonstatue2.jpg" align="left" /></a>The 2011, SMITHSONIAN EDITION of “THE JEFFERSON BIBLE: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth Extracted Textually from the Gospels in Greek, Latin, French and English” also opens a window into the spirit of a revolutionary complex and contradictory man.</p>
<p>Jefferson understood himself to be a true Christian and he proved so by remaining mute to the brutal and unjust accusations against him of being a deist, an atheist, anti-religion and antichrist.</p>
<p>Reality is that Jefferson took Jesus so seriously, that he devoted twelve years of his life to literally cutting away all the miracle stories from the gospels in four different languages from the King James Bible and gluing all the passages of Jesus as a teacher and philosopher, onto pages that were bound between covers of straight-grain red morocco- a goat skin that is laboriously processed for over two months and tanned with sumac.</p>
<p>In 1902, Congressman John F. Lacey, a devout Christian, introduced a resolution for the printing of a facsimile of Jefferson’s private piety to be distributed to Congress and up until the 1950’s, every newly elected member of the Senate received a copy on the very day they swore their oath of office.</p>
<p>Lacey responded to the many critics who argued that stripping Jesus of his divinity was blasphemy:</p>
<p>“No one that examines this little volume, whether he be saint or sinner, will rise from his perusal without having a loftier idea of the teachings of our Savior.”</p>
<p>On his tombstone, Jefferson expressed that he wanted to be remembered as the Author of the Declaration of American Independence, the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom and the Father of the University of Virginia.</p>
<p>The ideas that were “self-evident” to America&#8217;s Founding Fathers were the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment which put forth the primacy of human reason, conscience and inherent human rights as it called for public education.</p>
<p>The inscription under the Dome of the Jefferson Memorial reads: &#8220;I have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wrote those words first to Dr. Benjamin Rush, in his search for a rational Christianity that could not be found in the corruptions, misconceptions, superstitions and &#8220;priest craft&#8221; that became self-evident in the days of Emperor Constantine with Augustine&#8217;s JUST WAR heresy: <a href="http://wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=824&amp;Itemid=195">Read more&#8230;</a></p>
<p>Rush was raised in the evangelical “New Light” Presbyterian tradition of the 1730’s and his faith laid emphasis on the individual’s personal and emotional communion with God and believers who relied on the Bible and not the teachings of clergymen.</p>
<p>Rush was also a Philadelphia physician, scientist and an active force in humanitarian efforts to end African American slavery.</p>
<p>Rush wrote, “The truths of Christianity dwell alike in the mind of the Deity, and reason and religion are equally the offspring of his goodness.”</p>
<p>While watching Philly’s Grand Procession to celebrate the U.S. Constitution in 1788, Rush saw what was a then a profoundly “American parade…a rabbi walked with arms linked between a Catholic priest and Protestant clergy-man.”</p>
<p>Rush “always considered Christianity as the strong ground of Republicanism” -which is what we call democracy today.</p>
<p>In 1800, Rush wrote Jefferson, that this nation could only be steadied and the promise of the Revolution secured for future generations; if it is grounded in Christian morals and faith that are clarified by reason.</p>
<p>Jefferson’s friend and compatriot Thomas Paine &#8220;saw the exceeding probability that a revolution in the system of government would be followed by a revolution in the system of religion&#8221; soon after publishing &#8220;Common Sense&#8221; which was the spark that united the scattered disparate groups of colonists to rise up against the British Occupation of this homeland.<br />
Paine was later condemned as the “ungodly author of THE AGE OF REASON” for offering God as creator while rejecting the divinity of Jesus and denouncing clerical power. Paine also wrote:</p>
<p><em>A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives it a superficial appearance of being right.</p>
<p>It is not a God, just and good, but a devil, under the name of God, that the Bible describes.</p>
<p>Any system of religion that has anything in it that shocks the mind of a child, cannot be true.</p>
<p>Belief in a cruel God makes a cruel man.</p>
<p>Every religion is good that teaches man to be good; and I know of none that instructs him to be bad.</p>
<p>Is it not a species of blasphemy to call the New Testament revealed religion, when we see in it such contradictions and absurdities.</p>
<p>Reason obeys itself; and ignorance submits to whatever is dictated to it.</p>
<p>Reputation is what men and women think of us; character is what God and angels know of us.</em></p>
<p>I imagine God and the angels might agree with these Top Ten Teachings of Jesus as gleaned from THE JEFFERSON BIBLE:</p>
<p>1. Be just and justice comes from virtue, which comes from the heart.<br />
2. Treat people the way you want to be treated.<br />
3. Always work for PEACEFUL resolutions, even to the point of returning violence with COMPASSION.<br />
4. Consider valuable the things that have no material value.<br />
5. Do not judge others.<br />
6. Do not bear grudges.<br />
7. Be modest and unpretentious.<br />
8. Give out of true generosity, not because one expects to be repaid or acknowledged.<br />
9. Being true to one&#8217;s self in more important than being loyal to one&#8217;s family and following ones conscience is the only way to do it.</p>
<p>10. Those who think they know the most are the most ignorant.</p>
<p>Jefferson also wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well aware that the opinions and belief of men depend not on their own will, but follow involuntarily the evidence proposed to their minds; that Almighty God hath created the mind free, and manifested his supreme will that free it shall remain by making it altogether insusceptible of restraint; that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments, or burthens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the holy author of our religion&#8230;&#8221; - &#8220;A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God who gave us life gave us liberty. Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just, that his justice cannot sleep forever. Commerce between master and slave is despotism. Nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people are to be free. Establish a law for educating the common people. This it is the business of the state and on a general plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am certainly not an advocate for frequent and untried changes in laws and constitutions. I think moderate imperfections had better be borne with; because, when once known, we accommodate ourselves to them, and find practical means of correcting their ill effects. But I know also, that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy, as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.&#8221;</p>
<p>If we truly “hold these truths to be self-evident: That all [people] are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights&#8230;that, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among [people] deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; and, whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the RIGHT of the people to ALTER or to ABOLISH it&#8221; may we also know that Governments have obligations, people have rights and among our rights is the obligation to hold our Government accountable.</p>
<p>I imagine this government and all who claim to be Christian would do well to read and think upon <em>The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth</em> by Thomas Jefferson but until you go there, I offer my spin on The Sermon on The Mount-which is the Christian Manifesto and tells the story of when Jesus of Nazareth was about 33 and hiked up a hill, sat down under an olive tree and began to teach the people:</p>
<p>&#8220;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words: it is those who know their own spiritual poverty, their own limitations and &#8216;sins&#8217; honestly and trust God loves them in spite of themselves who already live in the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>How comforted we will all be, when we see, we haven&#8217;t got a clue, as to the depth and breadth of pure love and mercy of The Divine Mystery of The Universe.</p>
<p>God&#8217;s name in ancient Aramaic is Abba which means Daddy as much as Mommy and He/She: The Lord has said, &#8220;My ways are not your ways. My thoughts are not yours.&#8221; -Isaiah 55:8</p>
<p>Christ proclaimed more: &#8220;Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The essence of meek is to be patient with ignorance, slow to anger and never hold a grudge. In other words: how comforted you will be when you also know humility; when you know yourself, the good and the bad, for both cut through every human heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, they will be filled.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words: how comforted you will be when your greatest desire is to do what &#8220;God requires, and he has already told you what that is; BE JUST, BE MERCIFUL and walk humbly with your Lord.&#8221;-Micah 6:8</p>
<p>&#8220;Blessed are the merciful, they will be shown mercy.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words: how comforted you will all be when you choose to return only kindness to your &#8216;enemy.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;For with the measure you measure against another, it will be measured back to you&#8221; Christ warns his disciples as he explains the law of karma in Luke 6:27-38.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they see God.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words: how comforted you will be when you WAKE UP and see God is already within you, within every man, every woman and every child. The Supreme Being is everywhere, the Alpha and Omega, beginning and end. Beyond The Universe -and yet so small; within the heart of every atom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blessed are The Peacemakers: THEY shall be called the children of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>And what a wonderful world it would be when we all seek peace by pursuing justice; for there can be none without the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blessed are those who are persecuted because they do what God requires, theirs is The Kingdom of Heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p>And one fine day the lion will lie down with The Lamb and man will make war no more; and that will create the Kingdom of God on planet earth. [1]</p>
<p>PS: The root of all &#8216;sin&#8217; is selfishness.</p>
<p>I IMAGINE Jefferson and Paine would agree that the world is one country, all people are sisters and brothers, doing good is good religion and if there is to be any church; Let It Be The Earth:</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/warrenobama3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/warrenobama2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a><em>Plastic pastors transparent enough to see through, like Joel Osteen, are not as dangerous as Rick Warren. Modalistic moguls of the painfully-obvious-money-hungry prosperity movement, like T.D. Jakes, are not as dangerous as Rick Warren. Self-serving sorcerers of the false signs and wonders movement, like Todd Bentley, are not as dangerous as Rick Warren. No. None of the before-mentioned personalities or groups are all that dangerous because what you see is what you get. They all lack the ability to change their appearance to accommodate a change in environment. They lack the chameleon-like ability, the self-serving ability, to say what needs to be said in order to keep people in every camp liking them.</em>—Tony Miano</p>
<p>In <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=14216">part 1</a> I brought you up to speed on what some “watchbloggers” refer to as “Kingsway-gate.”  I’m guessing we haven’t heard the end of this mess.  However, this matter and many others commented on in part 1 have helped to earn Rick Warren the title: Teflon Pastor.  So we shall see what happens with Kingsway-gate.</p>
<p><strong>Common ground in the love of God…or god?</strong></p>
<p>Most likely Saddleback Church congregants are unaware that their pastor signed a controversial document produced by the Yale Center for Faith and Culture titled <a href="http://www.yale.edu/faith/acw/acw.htm" target="_blank">Loving God and Neighbor Together: A Christian Response to a Common Word Between Us and You.</a>  In July 2008 Christian and Muslim leaders gathered at Yale University for a conference to promote understanding and peace between Christians and Muslims. The letter urged the two faiths to find “common ground” in the love of God.   Since Christians and Muslims do not believe in the same God, one wonders which God we’re to find common ground with.</p>
<p>The Christian Post <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/christians-muslims-seek-common-ground-at-historic-conference-33511/" target="_blank">reported</a> that Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, “disagreed with key points raised in the letter because he felt they compromised the Christian faith [and] amid calls for love in a common God, the letter ‘failed to clearly define the Christian understanding of God as the trinity.’&#8221;</p>
<p>So why would any serious Christian sign a document that did not clearly define the Trinity?</p>
<p>Rick Warren claims he believes in the Trinity and we must take him at his word on this.  But to what extent does his belief in the Trinity come through in his ministry to Muslims?  Does he keep his Trinitarian belief close to the vest so as not to offend them?  Or is he forthcoming in his belief that there is one true God who exists in three co-equal, co-eternal, and co-existent Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit?  If his Muslim friends cannot understand his view of the Godhead, perhaps he’s not bothering to explain it to them.</p>
<p>The Christian Post report revealed some of the notable leaders at the conference:</p>
<p><em>Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad of Jordan; former Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi of Sudan; Geoff Tunnicliffe, CEO and international director of World Evangelical Alliance; Leith Anderson, president of NAE; and Antonios Kireopoulos of the National Council of Churches. A handful of Jewish leaders will also attend the conference.</em></p>
<p>Scroll through the list of signatories and you’ll discover several other notable leaders (theological liberals) such as Emerging church proponents Brian McLaren, Tony Jones and Scot McKnight; prosperity evangelist David Yonggi Cho; one of the “seeker-sensitive” architects, Bill Hybles; Richard Mouw, President, Fuller Theological Seminary; David Neff, Editor in Chief, Christianity Today; gospel of self-esteem sageRobert Schuller; Marxist sympathizer Jim Wallis (mentioned in <a href="http://worldviewweekend.com/worldview-times/article.php?articleid=8091" target="_blank">part 1</a>); and of course Rick Warren.</p>
<p>Certainly biblical unity can be a good thing, but as Phil Johnson reminds us:</p>
<p><em>The concept of “unity”  commonly touted today has nothing whatsoever to do with ‘being in full accord and of one mind’ (<a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Philippians%202.2" target="_blank">Philippians 2:2</a>). Instead, it is a broad, visible, ecumenical homogeneity without boundaries.  And that is nothing like the biblical concept of unity.</em></p>
<p>What did Jesus say regarding unity?  “Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword” (Matt. 10:34).</p>
<p><strong>Global peace, at last</strong></p>
<p>April 17, 2005 speaking before 30,000 at Angel Stadium in Anaheim, Rick Warren breathlessly proclaimed his plan:</p>
<p><em>The bottom line is that we intend to reinvent mission strategy in the 21st century.  As I stated, this will be a new Reformation.  The First Reformation returned us to the message of the original church.  It was a reformation of doctrine – what the church BELIEVES.  This Second Reformation will return us to the mission of the original church.  It will be a reformation of PURPOSE – what the church DOES in the world.</em></p>
<p><em>Our goal will be to enlist one billion foot soldiers for the Kingdom of God, who will permanently change the face of international missions to take on these five ‘global giants’ for which the church can become the ultimate distribution and change agent to overcome Spiritual emptiness, Self-serving Leadership, Poverty, disease and ignorance . (<a href="http://www.letusreason.org/Popteac26.htm" target="_blank">Online source</a>)</em></p>
<p>Warren put forth his program for global Christian dominion.  He also encouraged the crowd, the majority of them Christians, to adopt the same sort of dedication shown by followers of Hitler, Lenin, and Mao.</p>
<p><strong>The New Apostolic Purpose Driven Reformation</strong></p>
<p>As Rick Warren reveals the details of his global agenda, more and more Christians are expressing concern over it.  And so are liberals.  In fact liberals are so uneasy over what he and other dominionists are doing that the New Apostolic Research Group was formed.  Far-left blogger Bruce Wilson is part of it.  In a 2009 column Wilson declared:</p>
<p><em>Both C. Peter Wagner and Rick Warren want to transform the world, and both [<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/05/AR2008020502467.html" target="_blank">1</a>,<a href="http://www.talk2action.org/story/2009/5/28/19033/8502" target="_blank">2</a>] have proclaimed the advent of a second Reformation. Wagner calls it the New Apostolic Reformation, while for Rick Warren this is a &#8220;purpose driven&#8221; effort powered by Warren&#8217;s global <a href="http://www.thepeaceplan.com/" target="_blank">P.E.A.C.E. Plan</a>. In Uganda both visions for societal transformation appear to include the categorical elimination of homosexuality &#8211; by any means.</em></p>
<p>By any means?  Hyperbole, I presume. As a committed lefty, Bruce Wilson fully supports the radical homosexual agenda to normalize sodomy and other aberrant behavior.</p>
<p>Wilson continues:</p>
<p><em>Rick Warren wrote his 1993 dissertation for a Doctorate of Ministry from Fuller Theological Seminar, under Wagner&#8217;s supervision. It is titled New Churches For a New Generation: Church Planting to Reach Baby Boomers. In his 2008 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dominion-Kingdom-Action-Change-World/dp/0800794354" target="_blank">&#8220;Dominion&#8221;</a>, C. Peter Wagner describes the process through which this brand of Christianity can take dominion over government and society, and Wagner claims that this can be done within a democratic framework. Wagner clearly states that Rick Warren&#8217;s global P.E.A.C.E. Plan is an example of &#8220;stage one&#8221;: </em></p>
<p><em>Wagner is the Convening Apostle in a movement of charismatic &#8220;relational networks&#8221; which has extended its reach from the United States to Uganda, and worldwide. Under its <a href="http://www.apostlesnet.net/" target="_blank">umbrella of authority</a> are virulently anti-gay apostles in the United States and Uganda including Lou Engle of <a href="http://www.thecall.com/" target="_blank">TheCall</a>, who led thousands of young people in a twelve hour November 1, 2008 stadium rally in support of California&#8217;s anti-gay marriage Proposition Eight. The San Diego event closed with Engle, a member of Wagner&#8217;s inner circle of &#8220;prophets,&#8221; <a href="http://www.talk2action.org/story/2008/11/4/14143/7617" target="_blank">calling for</a> Christian martyrs. Wagner&#8217;s plans include reorganizing charismatic Christianity under the authority of these apostles and prophets. (links in original) (<a href="http://www.talk2action.org/story/2009/12/4/134435/084/" target="_blank">Online source</a>)  </em></p>
<p>Wilson has done his homework on the NAR.  Unbelievably, most Christians have not taken this movement seriously even though these false teachers have united with the Christian Right, politicians, rock-star pastors, entertainers, radio personalities, and a host of Christian leaders.  Likewise, New Age Mormon Glenn Beck has weaseled his way into these groups.  (Learn more about the NAR <a href="http://emailbrigade.com/306.html" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Growing a church</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.churchplantingtoday.com/" target="_blank">Break Through These 3 Barriers to Growth</a> “Coach&#8221; Warren outlines three essentials for breaking through the barriers to church growth. Following is barrier #2:</p>
<p><strong><em>You must change the primary role of the pastor from minister to leader.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>What’s the difference? In leadership, you take the initiative; in ministry, you respond to the needs of others. When someone calls and you pick up the phone, that’s ministry. When you pick up the phone and call someone, that’s leadership. Typically, you learn ministry skills in seminary, but you learn leadership skills in seminars. Pastoring is a balance. Here are five skills you must learn if your church is going to grow:</em></p>
<p><em>…Learn to communicate your vision.</em></p>
<p><em>…Learn the ability to motivate through messages.</em></p>
<p><em>…Learn how to equip for ministry. If you don’t learn how to coach, you will not be able to equip. And, if you do not equip, you will burn out in ministry.</em></p>
<p><em>…Learn how to raise money. Those who write the agenda must also be able to underwrite it.</em></p>
<p><em>…Learn the skill of managing your time and energy.</em></p>
<p>What about Rick Warren’s view of growing a church?  In <a href="http://www.sovereigngraceministries.org/blogs/cj-mahaney/post/2011/05/19/Ordinary-Pastors-part-2-A-Biblical-Definition-of-Ministry.aspx" target="_blank">Ordinary Pastors, part 2: A Biblical Definition of Ministry</a> C. J. Mahaney defines pastoral ministry thusly:</p>
<p><em>Pastoral ministry that is pleasing to God is not ultimately about gifting, influence, or even fruitfulness. It is not about how many books you have written, which conferences invite you to speak, or how many of your sermons are downloaded on iTunes. It is not even about whether your church membership numbers grow or shrink. Pastoral ministry that is pleasing to God is about faithfulness to the charge of 2 Timothy 4. You and I are called to be faithful to this charge.</em></p>
<p>For the record, here’s what Paul said in 2 Timothy 4:1-5:</p>
<p><em>I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</em></p>
<p><strong>Peace + unity = universalism</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=14216&amp;action=edit">part 1</a>, I pointed out that Rick Warren serves on the advisory board of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation and that the foundation’s goal is to unify the world’s major religions.  Following is Warren’s explanation for serving:</p>
<p><em>The vision and values of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation are desperately needed today&#8230;. In any effort to help people learn to live and work together, we must engage the vast networks, resources, wisdom, and influence of the faith communities. My friends, [Roman Catholic] Tony Blair is uniquely prepared with the gifts of temperament, knowledge, experience, leadership, and global respect essential for a task this great. I honestly don’t know of anyone better suited for this challenge. It’s why I agreed to serve on the Advisory Board. The Tony Blair Faith Foundation’s potential for doing good is staggering.</em></p>
<p>What is staggering is that a Protestant pastor has no problem with a Catholic’s plan to unite all religious faiths.  In a piece I wrote titled <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/mwest/100525" target="_blank">Damnable heresies invading the church</a> I touched on the push for unity:</p>
<p><em>What Warren is purporting is ecumenicism. Actually, we are moving beyond ecumenicism into<a href="http://www.lighthousetrailsresearch.com/interspirituality.htm" target="_blank">interspirituality</a> (interfaith spirituality) or interdenominational cooperation.  “In the name of peace and unity,” says Ray Yungen, “the world’s religions are more and more joining together. And with that joining together will come a consensus that it is narrow minded and even hateful to say there is only one way to salvation.”</em></p>
<p><em>Peace and unity has a nice ring to it. But traditional, historic, evangelical Christianity holds that there is only one path to God, one door to enter through. Peter left no doubt when he said, “Salvation is found in no one else” (Acts 4:10). (Also see John 3:16, John 6:66-68, John 14:6, Acts 16:30-31, 1 Tim 2:3-6, 1 John 2:1)  The Bible clearly teaches that all paths do not lead to God.  Those who take a different path will spend eternity in hell.  So the loving thing for a committed Christian to do is to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with the lost.  In fact, Jesus commanded His followers to go out into the world and spread the good news.   Those who keep the good news to themselves fail to understand that God gives no second chances.  Jesus said, “Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity” (Mat. 7:22).</em></p>
<p>My reason for this article (part 1&amp;2) is to highlight some very concerning issues related to Rick Warren.  Each of the concerns that were identified could have been substantially expanded upon and if that is the readers’ desire there are links and references that will help one to do that.  My purpose has been to urge his followers and supporters to be like the Bereans who “were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so” (Acts 17:11).</p>
<p>In these dark days ahead, God’s people must be watchful and discerning. We must “Prove [test] all things; hold fast that which is good” (1Thes 5:21).</p>

This is Apartheid.&#8221;</em>- Arun Gandhi, after his 2004 visit to The Holy Land.</p>
<p>This week in Bethlehem, the second international Christ at the Checkpoint Conference concluded with a “major breakthrough in the evangelical world” and was attended by over 600 Evangelical Palestinian Christians, Christian Zionists and Messianic Christians.</p>
<p>They came together with “Hope in the Midst of Conflict” under the banner “Christ at the Checkpoint,” to seek understanding between Jews and Christians and reflect on &#8216;what would Jesus do’ about the Israeli occupation of Palestine and concluded with:<br />
The Christ at the Checkpoint Manifesto:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>The Kingdom of God has come. Evangelicals must reclaim the prophetic role in bringing peace, justice and reconciliation in Palestine and Israel.</li>
<li>Reconciliation recognizes God’s image in one another.</li>
<li>Racial ethnicity alone does not guarantee the benefits of the Abrahamic Covenant.</li>
<li>The Church in the land of the Holy One, has born witness to Christ since the days of Pentecost. It must be empowered to continue to be light and salt in the region, if there is to be hope in the midst of conflict.</li>
<li>Any exclusive claim to land of the Bible in the name of God is not in line with the teaching of Scripture.</li>
<li>All forms of violence must be refuted unequivocally.</li>
<li>Palestinian Christians must not lose the capacity to self-criticism if they wish to remain prophetic.</li>
<li>There are real injustices taking place in the Palestinian territories and the suffering of the Palestinian people can no longer be ignored. Any solution must respect the equity and rights of Israel and Palestinian communities.</li>
<li>For Palestinian Christians, the occupation is the core issue of the conflict.</li>
<li>Any challenge of the injustices taking place in the Holy Land must be done in Christian love. Criticism of Israel and the occupation cannot be confused with anti-Semitism and the delegitimization of the State of Israel.</li>
<li>Respectful dialogue between Palestinian and Messianic believers must continue. Though we may disagree on secondary matters of theology, the Gospel of Jesus and his ethical teaching take precedence.</li>
<li>Christians must understand the global context for the rise of extremist Islam. We challenge stereotyping of all faith forms that betray God’s commandment to love our neighbors and enemies. [1]</li>
</ol>
<p>Also this week, peace and justice activists in Johannesburg concluded a week of programs highlighting the similarities between the Apartheid regime in South Africa and that of Israel.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Israeli Apartheid Week is a global annual international series of events held in cities and campuses with the goal to educate people about Israeli Apartheid and because ‘it’s always about the money’ to build Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaigns.</p>
<p>Last year, Israeli Apartheid Week took place in more than 40 cities across the globe and the good news is that over 100 participated this year!</p>
<p>When it came to South African Apartheid, the US was one of the last to get on-board and only did so when President Ronald Reagan was forced to sign a Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act “because the citizens’ movements in the United States had so effectively turned around United States politics that the Republican senators were telling him that it was in the interest of the Republican Party to sign.”</p>
<p>Last week in D.C. thousands of US Christians united with Jewish AIPAC supporters who converged on the Capitol to lobby Congress in support of the state of Israel and push America into war with Iran.</p>
<p>The Christians who attended the “Christ at the Checkpoint” conference sought to answer, “How should Christ followers respond to this political, multi-faceted conflict?”</p>
<p>They desired “to promote awareness, a message of unity, and contribute to peace and justice for all of the world&#8217;s inhabitants. [With] hope to be challenged and to challenge the global church on its moral, ethical, and prophetic responsibility.”</p>
<p>In 1948 there were 29,000 Palestinian Christians living in the land many call Holy but because of The Christian Exodus, they number less than 10,000 today; not because of Judaism or Islam, but because of a brutal and illegal military occupation that denies their human rights and prevents them from reaching their jobs, land, holy sites and families which have been separated by Israel’s wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Financed with U.S. aid at a cost of $1.5 million per mile, the Israeli wall prevents residents from receiving health care and emergency medical services. In other areas, the barrier separates farmers from their olive groves which have been their families&#8217; sole livelihood for generations.&#8221; [Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, Page 43, Jan/Feb. 2007]</p>
<p>During the conference, the Mayor of Bethlehem, Victor Batarseh, spoke about the Apartheid Wall and other “walls in this world – walls of religion, race, gender&#8230; we want to break down all the seen and unseen walls in the world. [he thanked the delegates for] breaking down the wall – not physically, but psychologically [and continued] we live in a big prison in this city but as Muslims and Christians we always have hope” and he concluded by saying that “with your help we can achieve peace.” [3]<br />
The first time I met Mayer Batarseh was when he traveled to Florida in 2005, to meet with Mayor Buddy Dyer, with the hope to re-ignite The Twinning Agreement that was signed in May 2001 by the then Mayors of Bethlehem and Orlando.</p>
<p>The Twinning Agreement is a sister-pact that affirmed Orlando and Bethlehem would encourage tourism to the other and promote a global community. I followed up on Mayor Batarseh’s visit with my own visit to Mayor Buddy Dyer’s office one week after the Mayors had met.</p>
<p>I informed the Orlando Mayor’s public relations representative about an opportunity to help the city of Bethlehem and was seeking the Mayors support in getting the word out about two events that were already scheduled and my involvement with Palestinian Children’s Welfare Fund, who imported goods crafted by the artisans in Bethlehem that volunteers sold throughout the world. We returned 100% of all proceeds back to the crafts people and any remaining went to help support the children who endure in the refugee camps of the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Mayor Buddy Dyer did not even have the common courtesy to respond to any of my three follow up emails and multiple phone calls.</p>
<p>I also informed The Orlando Sentinel about the opportunity for the Central Florida community to do something to make true the words of the Twinning Agreement without traveling all the way to the Little Town of Bethlehem in occupied territory.</p>
<p>I got nowhere, but I keep writing about it because the proverb is; &#8216;if you want to change the world: WRITE!&#8217;</p>
<p>In 2006, while I was in Bethlehem I again met Mayor Batarseh and he told me:</p>
<p>“When the occupation is ended there will be peace. If the world boycotted Israel for six months they would comply with the UN Resolutions which is all we want! There is state terrorism and Israel must be forced to recognize our right to exist. For the past ten years Hamas has worked with and helped the poorest of people, they have built schools and orphanages. The PA took the money but Hamas was providing the social services!</p>
<p>“Israel is a state built on religious beliefs. The US and EU and all the free world are against theocracies. But Israel has the right to do anything! The world needs to WAKE UP! If there is no peace in the Holy Land there can be no peace anywhere. End the occupation and there will be peace the very next day. All the terrorism in the world can be traced back to the Palestinian situation. All the money spent on weapons and war could eliminate world poverty.” [4]</p>
<p>There can be no peace without justice and there is no justice without accepting the truth.</p>
<p>There is more than enough blame to be shared by all but playing that game- as well as living in the past- has got no soul!</p>
<p>For this American struggling Christian Anarchist and candidate for US HOUSE of Representatives, who seeks to change US foreign policy and challenge all Christians, I propose believers and unbelievers would do well to consider just WHO their Jesus is.</p>
<p>The gospel [which means good news] that Jesus preached, was very political and a direct challenge to the politically powerful, arrogant, self-satisfied and self-righteous.</p>
<p>Two thousand years ago the Cross had NO symbolic religious meaning and was not a piece of jewelry.</p>
<p>When Jesus said: &#8220;Pick up your cross and follow me,&#8221; everyone back then understood he was issuing a POLITICAL statement, for the main roads in Jerusalem were lined with crucified agitators, rebels, dissidents and any others who disturbed the status quo of the Roman Occupying Forces.</p>
<p>Jesus was never a Christian, for that term was not even coined until the third decade after his crucifixion.</p>
<p>Jesus was born, lived and died a devout Jewish nonviolent Palestinian whose last message to his community was “Put down the sword!”</p>
<p>In the latter days of Nero&#8217;s reign [54-68 A.S.] through the domination of Domitian [ 81-96] Christians were persecuted for following the nonviolent, loving and forgiving Jesus.</p>
<p>That Jesus was first left behind when Augustine penned The Just War Theory.</p>
<p>Augustine was the first Church Father to consider the concept of a Just War and within 100 years after Constantine, the Empire required that all soldiers in the army must be baptized Christians and thus, the decline of Christianity began.</p>
<p>With the justification of war and violence supplied by Augustine’s Just War Theory, wrong became right. Nothing much has changed in two millennial, for in today’s Orwellian world politicians claim the way to peace is through war and that nuclear weapons provide protection.</p>
<p>The first mention of Israel in the Bible is in Genesis 32, when Jacob wrestled, struggled and then clung to the Divine Being and was then renamed Israel. I contend that ANYONE who does the same is that Biblical Israel too!</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/zion-book-cover-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/zion-book-cover-2.jpg" alt="" /></a>Many American Christian Evangelicals interpreted the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 and the return of the Jews to the Hebrews ancient homeland as a precondition for the Second Coming of Christ.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans believe in the theology espoused in the “Left Behind” series of novels that chronicle apocalyptic times set in the 21st century that winds up in Israel where, according to the author’s understanding of the Book of Revelation, the final battle in the world will be fought on an ancient battlefield called Armageddon. These literalists believe that war will be followed by seven years of global tribulation before Jesus returns to begin a 1,000-year rule on earth; but the Jews and all others who do not believe Jesus is God will be annihilated.</p>
<p>The bottom and nearly the last line in the book of Revelation is this warning:</p>
<p>“I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man shall add unto them, God shall add unto him the plagues which are written in this book: and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book.</p>
<p>These fundamentalists also believe that the only Jews who are following God are the hard line Jewish fundamentalist settlers who occupy legally owned Palestinian property in the West Bank and who were evacuated from Gaza in 2005. The Jewish settlers and Christian fundamentalists share the core conviction that God made a real estate deal with the ancient Hebrews that gives 21st century Jews every grain of sand between the Dead Sea, the Jordan River, and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>My first book,<em> KEEP HOPE ALIVE</em> counters the theology found in the <em>Left Behind</em> series and the fictional character, Brother Harold nails this particular fundamentalist misunderstanding in Chapter 8</p>
<blockquote><p><a title="Click here for details" href="http://wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=26"><img src="http://wearewideawake.org/images/stories/Finalcover.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="213" border="0" hspace="0" /></a></p>
<p>Harold lifted his almost empty pouch of Crown Royal and exclaimed, “Let’s toast the man, and then I’ll tell you what my daddy told me when I was a kid, when my brothers and I would get out of hand. He’d say, ‘boys, you all are going the way of Cain and Abel, and you’d better quit. For one of those boys was filled with so much hatred and jealousy that he killed the other.’</p>
<p>“Then my old man would be on a roll, and he’d tell us about Sarah, Abraham’s wife. And we loved to hear that part, so we’d quit our fight. You see, although Sarah was already menopaused, she still desired a child. God had even shared a laugh with her about it coming true, but just like a woman, she took the matter into her own hands, and refused to wait for the Lord to deliver. So old Sarah decided to give her maidservant to her old man, and that chick and Abraham made a kid. Everything was fine when Ishmael arrived, but only for a very short while.</p>
<p>“Now, although Sarah was a dried-up old crone, she, too, birthed a son, and named him after the laughter she had shared with God, but called the kid Isaac. Sarah had gotten very territorial and demanded Abraham cast out his beloved first son with his mama Haggar, into the barren wilderness, and Abraham did it! But, as God always hears the cries of mothers and sons, he promised to make a great nation from Ishmael’s descendants, too. And thus, the Arab nation was born.</p>
<p>“By the sixth century before Christ, the conflicts in the land were already old news, and Jeremiah warned the people that all God could see was violence and destruction in the city. Sickness and wounds were all around.</p>
<p>“And then my old man would get tears in his eyes and softly recite:</p>
<p>“For every misunderstanding, every condemning thought, every negative vibration, every tear torn from a heart, every time one grabbed and wouldn’t let go, and they only did it because they did not know. The Divine is within all creation and within all women and men.</p>
<p>“And every tiny kindness you have ever done, every gentle word spoken, every time you held your tongue, every positive thought, every smile freely given, every helping hand that opens, helps bring in the kingdom. And the kingdom comes from above, and it comes from within. Imagine a kingdom of sisterhood of all creatures and all men.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Rev. Stephen Sizer is an Anglican priest from the UK and internationally recognized Biblical authority regarding Christian Zionism.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/zion-book-cover1.jpg"><img title="zion book cover" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/zion-book-cover1-204x320.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="320" /></a>In <em>ZION’S CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS?</em> Sizer sheds much needed light on how Jesus/The Prince of Peace- who commanded of his followers that they must forgive their enemies and love all people equally- has morphed into a militant crusader by many professing Christians.</p>
<p>Sizer’s timely focus on the Holy Land, in particular Jerusalem, The Temple and the future of the world juxtaposed with the current political climate and neo-con ideology could wake up many American Christians who have been led astray by the heretical teachings of John Hagee, Hal Lindsay and Tim LaHaye.</p>
<p>The vast majority of American Christians are unaware that since 1948, the indigenous Christian population of the land we call Holy has gone from 20% of the total population to less than 1.3% today.</p>
<p>Scholars and researches claim that unless things change asap, there will be no Christian witness in the land where Jesus promised that it is the Peacemakers who are the children of God by 2020!</p>
<p>“It is irresponsible to suggest that God will bless us materially if we support the largely secular State of Israel, especially when this invariably means ignoring the plight of the indigenous Christian population of Palestine.”-page 46, Zion’s Christian Soldiers</p>
<p>Sizer’s previous book Christian Zionism-Road Map to Armageddon? is the companion text to ZION’S CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS? which details how a cultish escapist theology fused with neo-con political ideology which has lead millions of US Christians astray as it tips the world on its side heavy with military artillery.</p>
<p>“Zion’s Christian Soldiers” utilizes easy to comprehend diagrams and thought provoking end of chapter questions that could help bring American Bible Study programs into the 21st Century and infuse them with a much needed breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>Having been to Israel Palestine seven times since June 2005, I highly recommend Sizer’s scholarly yet easy to comprehend work to all Christians who have the courage to face reality and reclaim the gospel Jesus taught which is The Peacemakers are the children of God.</p>
<p>Sizer’s struggle is also intended to provoke Christians to remember that the Prince of Peace is the fulfillment of the Hebrew scriptures as fundamentalist militant minded Christians have replaced Jesus with the state of Israel.</p>

<p>What follows is an excerpt from Sizer’s Seven Biblical Answers to Popular Zionist Assumptions can be downloaded here: <a href="http://www.sizers.org/articles/7answers.pdf">http://www.sizers.org/articles/7answers.pdf</a></p>
<blockquote><p>God blesses those who bless Israel and curses those who curse Israel</p>
<p>“I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you” (Genesis 12:2-3). The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say “and to seeds,” meaning many people, but “and to your seed,” meaning one person, who is Christ… There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.” (Galatians 3:16, 28-29)</p>
<p>“I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore… and through your seed all nations on earth will be blessed…” (Genesis 22:17-18)</p>
<p>This popular assumption is based on Genesis 12:3. First, note that the promise was made to Abram (that is, Abraham) and no one else. Second, there is nothing in the text to indicate God intended the promise to apply to Abraham’s physical descendants unconditionally, or in perpetuity. Third, in the New Testament we are told explicitly that the promises were fulfilled in Jesus Christ and in those who acknowledge Him as their Lord and Saviour. God’s blessings come by grace through faith, not by works or race (Ephesians 2:8-9).</p>
<p>The “Promised Land” was given by God to the Jewish people as an everlasting inheritance</p>
<p>Contrary to popular assumption, the Scriptures repeatedly insist that the land belongs to God and that residence is always conditional.</p>
<p>For example, God said to his people, “‘The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you reside in my land as foreigners and strangers.” (Leviticus 25:23). In Ezekiel, it seems the Lord anticipated the reasoning of those who arrogantly claimed rights to the land because of the covenant originally made with Abraham.</p>
<p>“Son of man, the people living in those ruins in the land of Israel are saying, ‘Abraham was only one man, yet he possessed the land. But we are many; surely the land has been given to us as our possession.’ Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Since you eat meat with the blood still in it and look to your idols and shed blood, should you then possess the land? You rely on your sword, you do detestable things… Should you then possess the land?’ … I will make the land a desolate waste, and her proud strength will come to an end.’ (Ezekiel 33:24-26,28-29)</p>
<p>Residence was open to all God’s people on the basis of faith not race. Indeed, the writer to Hebrews explains that the land was never their ultimate desire or inheritance any way but a temporary residence until the coming of Jesus Christ. Our shared eternal inheritance is heavenly not earthly.</p>
<p>Jerusalem is the exclusive and undivided, eternal capital of the Jewish people</p>
<p>The Christian Zionist assertion that God intended Jerusalem to be the exclusive and undivided eternal capital of the Jewish people has no basis whatsoever in Scripture. God insists in Psalm 87 that Jerusalem must be a shared and inclusive city. Nations specifically mentioned include what is today, Egypt, Iran and Lebanon. Even the hated Philistines are mentioned as “…born in Zion” on the basis of faith not race. Likewise, the vision of Isaiah 2 associates Jerusalem with the end of war, with peace and reconciliation.</p>
<p>“In the last days the mountain of the LORD’s temple will be established as the highest of the mountains; it will be exalted above the hills, and all nations will stream to it. Many peoples will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths.” (Isaiah 2:2-3)</p>
<p>But what of Luke 21:24, “Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled”? The assertion that this prophecy came true in 1967 is problematic since Revelation 11:2 says the Gentile ‘trampling’ of Jerusalem would last only ’42 months’. The context of Luke 21 shows Jesus was referring to the events of 70AD and God’s sovereign use of foreign tyrants to fulfil his purposes. The focus of the New Testament instead moves away from the earthly Jerusalem toward the new, heavenly Jerusalem as the home of all who trust in Jesus (Hebrews 12:22-23; Revelation 21:2; 22-27).</p>
<p>Believers will soon be ‘raptured’ to heaven before the ‘end-time’ battle of Armageddon</p>
<p>The rapture is a popular idea that Jesus will actually return twice: first of all secretly, to rescue true believers out of the world, then later visibly with his saints to judge the world. There is, again, no basis in Scripture for this novel idea. The Bible is emphatic: the return of Jesus will be personal, sudden, public, visible and glorious. -Matthew 24:30-31</p>
<p>“At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the peoples of the earth[a] will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.” “For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.”- 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</p>
<p>The idea of a secret rapture is actually based on a misreading of Matthew 24:40-41 and Luke 17:34-35…Our mandate is to be peacemakers not widow makers (Matthew 5:3-10). We are ‘God’s co-workers’ entrusted as ambassadors with a ministry of reconciliation not speculation (2 Corinthians 5:11-6:2)…###</p></blockquote>
<p>A recent Zogby International poll found that 31% of those surveyed in the national poll strongly believe or somewhat believe in the ideas behind Christian Zionism, defined as “the belief that Jews must have all of the promised land, including all of Jerusalem, to facilitate the second coming of the messiah.”</p>
<p>A CNN/Time poll showed that 59% of the American public believes the prophecies contained in the Book of Revelation will come true.</p>
<p>Christian Zionism is an extremist Christian fundamentalist movement which supports the claims of those who believe that the State of Israel should take control of all of the land currently disputed between Palestinians and Israelis and views the creation and expansion of the modern state of Israel as a fulfillment of biblical prophecy toward the second coming of Jesus.</p>
<p>Christian Zionism is a two hundred year old theological and political movement that embraces the most extreme ideological positions of Zionism, thereby becoming detrimental to a just peace within Palestine and Israel.</p>
<p>The Christian Zionist program provides a worldview where the Gospel is identified with the ideology of empire, colonialism and militarism. In its extreme form, it laces an emphasis on apocalyptic events leading to the end of history rather than living Christ’s love and justice today.</p>
<p>Christian Zionism is also an escapist theology and a match made in hell for neo-con ideology.</p>
<p>These Christians believe that God fights on the side of Israel and they call for unqualified support for the most extreme right wing political positions related to the Holy Land. Christian Zionism has significant support within American Protestant fundamentalists, who number between 10 and 20 million. Its reach is broad, by virtue of its favorite themes related to the “End Times” and an Israel-fixated Christian media.</p>
<p>Christian Zionism is both a “movement” and a way of interpreting current events. Its focus is on Israel and the Middle East, as much an ideology as a “movement.” Its promoters share many beliefs but are not organized through any one institution.</p>
<p>Throughout history Christians have at times twisted scripture to justify violence: for the Crusades, for Anti-Semitism, and for slavery. Too often the church has been neglected to respond to these biblical distortions and with disastrous results.</p>
<p>Although the Christian Zionists motives are couched in terms of compassion toward the Jewish people based on a literal reading of scripture their political agenda of territorial expansion Zionists has allowed the ongoing injustices against Palestinians.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tikkun is Hebrew for mend, repair and transform the world. Tikkun is also an organization that researched to discover that there are three distinct elements energizing the Christian Zionists:</p>
<p>1. A strong commitment to conservative and ultra-nationalist American politics (so strong, I believe, that if the U.S. were to decide to break with Israel, this part of the Christian Zionist leadership would go along with that and drop its defense of Israeli policies).</p>
<p>2. Dispensationalist religious commitments that lead many of the Christian Zionists to yearn for a cataclysmic “end of history” eschatological war in the Middle East that will precipitate the second coming of Jesus and the Rapture in which all true Christians will go to heaven and all Jews who have not yet converted to Christianity will burn in hell for eternity.</p>
<p>3. A widespread understanding among many Christians that atonement and repentance is needed for 1700 years of murder, rape, and oppression of Jews that was frequently generated by the Church (though, of course, the Evangelicals do not recognize that church as their church). In this category are many Christian Zionists who genuinely feel terrible about what has happened to the Jews and genuinely want to help the Jewish people. Their philo-Semitism is real and sincere.- Rabbi Lerner, TIKKUN Magazine page 9, Nov/Dec. 2007</p></blockquote>
<p>Jews and Christians worship the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, but many fail to comprehend that the first mention of Israel is in Genesis 32:22, when Jacob was renamed Israel for having wrestled and struggled with the Divine.</p>
<p>Thus, to claim that the secular ethnocratic state of Israel has a divine right that supersedes the divine rights of the indigenous people of the land, reeks of racism and misses the point of what the Hebrew prophets were always on about:</p>
<p>“What does God require? He has told you o’man! Be just, be merciful, and walk humbly with your Lord.” -Micah 6:8</p>
<p>“My people are fools, they do not know me! They are skilled in doing evil, they know not how to do good.”-Jeremiah 4:22</p>
<p>“From Moses to Jeremiah and Isaiah, the Prophets taught…that the Jewish claim on the land of Israel was totally contingent on the moral and spiritual life of the Jews who lived there, and that the land would, as the Torah tells us, ‘vomit you out’ if people did not live according to the highest moral vision of Torah. Over and over again, the Torah repeated its most frequently stated mitzvah [command]:</p>
<p>“When you enter your land, do not oppress the stranger; the other, the one who is an outsider of your society, the powerless one and then not only ‘you shall love your neighbor as yourself’ but also ‘you shall love the other.’”-Rabbi Lerner, TIKKUN Magazine, page 35, Sept./Oct. 2007</p>
<p>The term Christianity was also not even coined until three decades after Jesus Christ walked the earth.</p>
<p>Until the day of Paul, followers of Jesus were called members of The Way; meaning the way he taught his followers to be!</p>
<p>Christ was never a Christian, but was born and died a Palestinian devout Jew who was a social justice radical revolutionary road warrior that challenged the job security of the Temple authorities by teaching the people they did NOT need to pay the priests for ritual baths or sacrificing livestock to be OK with God; for God already LOVED them just as they were: sinners, poor, diseased, outcasts, widows, orphans, refugees and prisoners all living under a brutal Roman Military Occupation.</p>
<p>What got Jesus crucified was disturbing the status quo of the Roman Occupying Forces, by teaching the subversive concept that Caesar only had power because God allowed it and that God preferred the humble sinner, the poor, diseased, outcasts, widows, orphans, refugees and prisoners all living under Roman Occupation above the elite and arrogant.</p>
<p>The problem is not with Christianity, but that too few who claim to be Christians have actually done what Jesus taught and I spin Jesus’ Manifesto this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>About 2,000 years ago, when Christ was about 33, he hiked up a hill and sat down under an olive tree and began to teach the people;</p>
<p>“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.”</p>
<p>In other words: it is those who know their own spiritual poverty, their own limitations and ‘sins’ honestly and trust God loves them in spite of themselves who already live in the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>How comforted we will all be, when we see, we haven’t got a clue, as to the depth and breadth of pure love and mercy of The Divine Mystery of The Universe.</p>
<p>God’s name in ancient Aramaic is Abba which means Daddy as much as Mommy and He/She: The Lord has said, “My ways are not your ways. My thoughts are not yours.” -Isaiah 55:8</p>
<p>Christ proclaimed more: “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.”</p>
<p>The essence of meek is to be patient with ignorance, slow to anger and never hold a grudge. In other words: how comforted you will be when you also know humility; when you know yourself, the good and the bad, for both cut through every human heart.</p>
<p>“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, they will be filled.”</p>
<p>In other words: how comforted you will be when your greatest desire is to do what “God requires, and he has already told you what that is; BE JUST, BE MERCIFUL and walk humbly with your Lord.”-Micah 6:8</p>
<p>“Blessed are the merciful, they will be shown mercy.”</p>
<p>In other words: how comforted you will all be when you choose to return only kindness to your ‘enemy.’</p>
<p>“For with the measure you measure against another, it will be measured back to you” Christ warns his disciples as he explains the law of karma in Luke 6:27-38.</p>
<p>“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they see God.”</p>
<p>In other words: how comforted you will be when you WAKE UP and see God is already within you, within every man, every woman and every child. The Supreme Being is everywhere, the Alpha and Omega, beginning and end. Beyond The Universe -and yet so small; within the heart of every atom.</p>
<p>“Blessed are The Peacemakers: THEY shall be called the children of God.”</p>
<p>And what a wonderful world it will be when we all seek peace by pursuing justice; for there can be none without the other.</p>
<p>“Blessed are those who are persecuted because they do what God requires, theirs is The Kingdom of Heaven.”</p>
<p>And one fine day the lion will lie down with The Lamb; meaning man will make war no more and that would create a sisterhood of man which just maybe the Kingdom of God on planet earth.</p></blockquote>

				<p>November 5, 2011 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=12726#respond" title="Comment on Is Rick Perry on a mission from God?"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="12726 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=12726">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/Rick-Perry-Army-Of-God3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/Rick-Perry-Army-Of-God2.jpg" alt="" /></a>GOP hopeful Rick Perry is an evangelical Christian.  Recently his wife stated that before he made his decision to run “He prayed about it, he really prayed about it.”  Praying before making important decisions isn’t unusual for most Christians.  What’s unusual, and also troubling, is her comment that “He threw that fleece out twice to make sure it came back wet.”</p>
<p>Anita Perry was referring to a Bible story about a leader in Israel whose name was Gideon. (Judges 6-7)   God spoke to Gideon and told him to gather the Israelite troops to defeat the Midianite invaders.  Gideon wanted to be sure it was actually God’s voice he heard so he asked for a sign.  Wanting to determine God’s will, Gideon put out a piece of wool overnight and asked God to make it wet while keeping the dirt on the threshing room floor dry. God graciously complied.  The next morning the fleece was wet enough to wring out.</p>
<p>Now, we have no way of knowing if Rick Perry actually heard from the Lord  &#8211; but he thinks he did because, not only is he running, his wife believes that the Lord called him to be the next U.S. president.</p>
<p>Putting out a fleece is the way in which some believers, especially those in the charismatic movement, seek God&#8217;s approval for doing what they feel “led” to do.  Here’s a quick example of how this works.  A man applies for a history professor position at a college in Ashford North Carolina but he’s not sure he wants to uproot his family and move to NC.  So he prays, “Lord, if it’s your will that I take the job in NC, please give me a sign.”  A few days later he gets a call from a college buddy he hasn’t talked to in years.  He’s astonished to learn that his buddy’s a high school teacher in Ashford, Connecticut!  College, Ashford, teacher…God must be telling him to accept the job.  Get the picture?</p>
<p>On the campaign trail Anita Perry said of her husband:  “He is the only true conservative.”  Then, realizing her blunder, she added, “Well, there are some true conservatives.  And they’re there for good reasons. And they may feel like God called them, too. But I truly feel like we are here for that purpose.”</p>
<p>Does Anita Perry have a private hotline to God?</p>
<p>Before I answer that question here’s something else to ponder.  At another campaign rally Mrs. Perry told the crowd that her husband didn’t want to run so he needed some convincing.  She said, “God was already speaking to me, but he felt like he needed to see the burning bush.  I said, ‘Let me tell you something: You might not see the burning bush but other people are seeing it for you.’ ”</p>
<p>What Anita meant by “burning bush” comes from Exodus 3 where God spoke to Moses through a burning bush to instruct him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.  Evidently Rick Perry used the burning bush metaphor during a conversation with his wife because he wanted to be certain God was leading him to run the country before he tossed the proverbial hat into the ring.</p>
<p>APOSTLES AND PROPHETS AND GOVERNORS OH MY!</p>
<p>Perhaps the answer to Gov. Perry’s prayers came through so-called “apostles” and “prophets” who believe they actually do have a private hotline to God.  On September 28, 2009 they declared that the governor would have a leadership role beyond Texas:</p>
<p><em>On this day, the Lord’s messengers arrived in the form of two Texas pastors, Tom Schlueter of Arlington and Bob Long of San Marcos, who called on Perry in the governor’s office inside the state Capitol. Schlueter and Long both oversee small congregations, but they are more than just pastors. They consider themselves modern-day apostles and prophets, blessed with the same gifts as Old Testament prophets or New Testament apostles.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://tomschlueter.blogspot.com/2011/06/courageous-governor-call-to-pray.html" target="_blank"><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">The pastors told Perry</span></em></a><em> of God’s grand plan for Texas. A chain of powerful prophecies had proclaimed that Texas was “The Prophet State,” anointed by God to lead the United States into revival and Godly government. And the governor would have a special role.</em></p>
<p><em>The day before the meeting, Schlueter had received a prophetic message from </em><a title="Chuck Pierce website" href="http://www.gloryofzion.org/chuckpierce.php" target="_blank"><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chuck Pierce</span></em></a><em>, an influential prophet from Denton, Texas. God had apparently commanded Schlueter—through Pierce—to “pray by lifting the hand of the one I show you that is in the place of civil rule.”</em></p>
<p><em>Gov. Perry, it seemed.</em></p>
<p><em>Schlueter had prayed before his congregation: “Lord Jesus I bring to you today Gov. Perry. &#8230; I am just bringing you his hand and I pray Lord that he will grasp ahold of it. For if he does you will use him mightily.”</em></p>
<p><em>And grasp ahold the governor did. At the end of their meeting, Perry asked the two pastors to pray over him. As the pastors would later recount, the Lord spoke prophetically as Schlueter laid his hands on Perry, their heads bowed before a painting of the Battle of the Alamo. Schlueter “declared over [Perry] that there was a leadership role beyond Texas and that Texas had a role beyond what people understand…” </em><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span>(<a href="http://www.texasobserver.org/cover-story/rick-perrys-army-of-god" target="_blank">Online source</a><span style="font-family: Calibri;">)</span></p>
<p>Schlueter and Long are a part of a cult-like movement known as the <a href="http://www.deceptioninthechurch.com/thirdwaveteachings.html" target="_blank">New Apostolic Reformation</a> (NAR).  Those in the movement believe that God has given them the authority to bring about social transformation and usher in the Kingdom of God on Earth.  Not only have they declared Gov. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Perry </span></span>God’s anointed president, they also proclaim that Te<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">xas</span></span> will lead the U.S. to an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">economic and</span></span>spiritual recovery.</p>
<p>But what about the other GOP candidates that claim they’re Christians?  Among the group are those who self-identify as evangelical and Catholic plus there are a couple of Mormons.  They all believe they will lead the U.S. to an economic recovery.  Some of them might even believe they’re God’s anointed president.  And remember that Barack Obama’s supporters truly believe he’s the Anointed One.</p>
<p>Confusing isn’t it?</p>
<p>DIVINING GOD’S WILL</p>
<p>The question Christians must ask themselves is this: Does the Bible teach that God’s people should seek guidance from Above by putting out a fleece or looking for providential signs?   Rick Perry thinks so.  After all, he put out a fleece.</p>
<p>Here are a few more questions to mull over: Does God speak to His people today the same way He spoke to them in the Old Testament?  Does the Holy Spirit “whisper in our ear”?  Do we hear from Him in visions and dreams?  Through prophets…angels…animals…signs…<wbr>coincidences?  What about through a subjective experience? A “feeling?”  A “burning in the bosom”?</wbr></p>
<p>Consider what I wrote on this subject in <a href="http://www.newswithviews.com/West/marsha11.htm" target="_blank">Found: God’s Will</a>:</p>
<p><em>Looking for signs through coincidences, or flipping through the Bible and placing your finger on a verse, or relying on the first thought to enter your mind after a prayer, are forms of Christian divination. </em></p>
<p>Moreover,</p>
<p><em>If you search the New Testament you’ll find no explicit command to “Find God’s will.” Read through the book of Acts and you’ll see what I mean. The Apostles were given no clear instructions on how they were to discern God’s will. No prayer ritual. No magic formulas. Nothing!</em></p>
<p>Applying <a href="http://www.sermonaudio.com/playpopup.asp?SID=8141123285" target="_blank">hidden meanings to Scripture</a> is irresponsible and it’s unbiblical! Anyone who twists God’s Word for their own purposes does so “to their own destruction” (2 Peter 3:16).</p>
<p>FINDING GOD’S WILL</p>
<p>Dr. John McArthur is the pastor-teacher of Grace Community Church.   Recently Phil Johnson, Executive Director of MacArthur’s radio broadcast <em>Grace to You</em>, interviewed his boss and asked for his perspective on the modern day belief that the Holy Spirit leads us by “nudging us or whispering to us or giving us dreams [and] things like that.”  Following is an excerpt from their discussion:</p>
<p><em>Well, I think the Holy Spirit does lead us but there is no way to perceive that that’s happening. … I don’t have a red light that goes on in my head and it goes around and around and around when the Holy Spirit’s leading. I don’t know when the Holy Spirit’s leading. I don’t know when I’m just following my impulses or my desires or whatever. I have no mechanism to know that. But in retrospect I see that.  And I categorize that in the providences of God. … my life is just one amazing act of divine providence after another, after another, after another …</em></p>
<p>Further in the interview MacArthur explains what he did when he was given a list of people who invited him to come and speak:</p>
<p><em>“Did I begin to go into some kind of mantra and say, “Ommm&#8230;” and see if I can induce the Holy Spirit to know what to do? No.  I just look at it and say, “Well, I can’t do that. I don’t think I can do that. That wouldn’t be a priority.  Maybe I should do that.  And you know what happens if I am open and want to do God’s will, it’s amazing how …  I can look back and say, “Wow, it was absolutely critical that I be there because look what happened when I got there, and this happened and that led to this, and this led to that.” That’s how my whole life has unfolded. So there’s no mechanism that we possess that tells us at the moment when the Holy Spirit is leading us in some supernatural way. …</em></p>
<p>Later he commented on the role of the Holy Spirit:</p>
<p><em>The Holy Spirit never illuminates anything to me that I don’t understand. You’ve got to understand it before the illumination kicks in. There is a certain illumination that’s salvific.  In other words, <strong>being regenerated is in itself the source of illumination. </strong>When I pick up the Bible and I read [about] God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, sin, man, redemption … I get it.  So there’s a generic kind of illumination in revelation.  And you could leave it at that level. You could go to the milk of the Word and say, “Okay, I’ve been illuminated on the milk of the Word, I get it, I understand the simple things of Scripture, you know, as many as received Him, became the sons of God,” and so forth. I can read that [passage] and understand it. … But for me to dig down and to enjoy the full illuminating possibilities of the work of the Holy Spirit in my life, <strong>I have to dig deep into the Scripture. It’s what I grasp that He illuminates. It’s what I understand that He illuminates. </strong>So yes, there’s a sense in which I am illuminated enough to understand Scripture at its basic level, the milk level, as Paul would call it. <strong>But to get the meat level, I’ve got to dig down in it.</strong> </em>(emphasis added)  (<a href="http://www.gty.org/resources/Sermons/GTY135/Practical-Concerns-in-the-Local-Church-An-Interview-with-John-MacArthur" target="_blank">Complete transcript</a>)</p>
<p>God still speaks to us today &#8212; but not through putting out a fleece.  In fact, this is pagan divination.  God doesn’t speak to us through a burning bush either.  God speaks to us through His Word, the Bible, which is inspired by the Holy Spirit (2 Tim 3:16-17).  Thus believers must never doubt that what the scriptures say is 100% true.   If we just take the time to read and study the Bible we’ll understand what God’s will is.  His will isn’t hidden—if He loves us why would He hide His will from us?  Answer:  He doesn’t! Again, putting out a fleece is unnecessary—and besides that, it’s unbiblical!</p>
<p>Any time someone claims that God has spoken to him/her, we must go to the Bible to find out if what he/she says lines up with what Scripture says.  God never contradicts Himself because He cannot deny Himself. (2 Tim 2:13) God does not tell us something in Scripture and tell us something different through the NAR.</p>
<p>Many of Perry’s supporters pleaded with him not to unite with the NAR and the International House of Prayer (<a href="http://herescope.blogspot.com/2008/09/ihop-latter-rain.html" target="_blank">IHOP</a>) for a <a href="http://www.emailbrigade.com/337.html" target="_blank">prayer rally</a> he held in August.  He was warned that both of these groups are on the radical fringe of Christianity but he ignored their warning even though there’s abundant proof that the NAR/IHOP is highly unorthodox.  These whack-a-doodles seriously believe that God, through the Holy Spirit, has given them supernatural powers to perform “signs &amp; wonders” that include raising the dead to life, healing the sick and casting out demons – and as of late, choosing an American president!</p>
<p>DOMINIONISM</p>
<p>I’ll conclude by presenting a condensed version of the NAR, aka <a href="http://www.discernment-ministries.org/ChristianImperialism.htm" target="_blank">dominionism</a>, to make it clear why a number of traditional Christians have grave concerns over Rick and Anita Perry’s religious alliances.  For two decades dominionists have traveled the globe performing “spiritual warfare” on “demonic strongholds” with their aim being to shoo away powerful demons and take dominion over the power of Satan.  They’ve performed spiritual warfare “through intense worship and praise, and by spiritual mapping, identifying strongholds, rebuking demonic powers and binding territorial spirits” in many U.S. cities.  “Doing the will of God will bring about God&#8217;s purposes and God’s reign.”  (<a href="http://www.letusreason.org/latrain1.htm" target="_blank">Online source</a>) They allege that San Francisco has a demonic stronghold so they’ve invested an enormous amount of time conducting spiritual warfare to drive demons out so that they can take the city for Christ.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?  SF shows no sign of becoming a godly city.  Just the opposite is true!  It’s clear who’s winning the battle: Demons 100 &#8212; Dominionists 0.</p>
<p>The NAR/dominionists believe “the world will be conquered through an elite group of overcomers who produce signs and wonders unlike anything ever seen, even in the early church by the apostles. This they believe will lead us to the greatest revival of history. An endtime harvest of billions of souls, where the majority of the world will be won to Christ and the kingdom would be established or ready to be received by Christ.”  (<a href="http://www.letusreason.org/latrain1.htm" target="_blank">Ibid</a>)</p>
<p>I cannot stress enough that NAR/dominionists apply a completely different meaning to passages of Scripture than what was intended by the author.  The result of this sort of Scripture twisting as well as adding to Scripture (what they deem “new revelation” through prophecy) is blatant heresy!</p>
<p>I’ve put forth only a small part of what dominionists are up to and why they fall into the false teacher category.  Jesus had harsh words for people like them.  He called them ravenous wolves!  (<a href="http://kingjbible.com/matthew/7.htm" target="_blank">Mat. 7:15</a>)</p>
<p>One last thing.  The Perrys are not alone in practicing Christian divination to discern God’s will.  This sort of practice is rampant among undiscerning Christians.   The Perrys are also not alone in uniting with the NAR/dominionists.  Many <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/mwest/110823" target="_blank">Religious Right leaders</a>have joined forces with them (also with other apostate movements and the cults) for purely political purposes.  As a result, they’re losing respect…and donations are dwindling.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/DominionistAgenda3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/DominionistAgenda2.jpg" alt="" /></a>Until recently not many folks were aware of a man by the name of C. Peter Wagner.  But Wagner is quickly becoming a person of interest thanks largely to Christian Right (CR) becoming chummy with him and other high-level charismatic dominionists.   In the past couple of months much has been written on pro-family groups uniting of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) dominionists.  In fact it was the prominent American Family Association (AFA) that sponsored Governor Rick Perry’s August 2011 prayer rally <em>The Response</em> that included many <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/mwest/110610" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">NAR notables in leadership</span></a> roles.</p>
<p>The NAR’s purpose is to restore the office of Apostles and Prophets and advance the Kingdom of God.  According to Albert James Dager “<em>dominion theology is predicated upon three basic beliefs: 1) Satan usurped man’s dominion over the earth through the temptation of Adam and Eve; 2) The Church is God’s instrument to take dominion back from Satan; 3) Jesus cannot or will not return until the Church has taken dominion by gaining control of the earth’s governmental and social institutions.</em>(<a href="http://www.mediaspotlight.org/pdfs/TheResponse.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Online source</span></a>)</p>
<p>So &#8211; the NAR/dominionist’s goal is to transform society into the kingdom of God on earth.  How?  By controlling various aspects of society.  The term they use is the “Seven Mountains,” or “Seven Spheres” of society.  The Seven Mountains are: 1) Arts and Entertainment; 2) Business/Economy; 3) Education; 4) Family; 5) Government; 6) Media; 7) Religion.   The NAR holds that as they accomplish ridding the world of evil, things will get better and better and then Jesus Christ will return to set up His kingdom.</p>
<p>The goals of the CR and the NAR seem like a good idea, right? I mean, who could argue with wanting to influence the seven spheres of society that are dominated by secular humanists.  Christians are not wrong in desiring to have a society based on Judeo-Christian principles.  But here’s the problem.  This “mandate” the NAR mob subscribes to did not come from the Lord Jesus Christ.  In John 18:36 Jesus made it clear: “My kingdom is not of this world.”</p>
<p>However, dominionists never let a little thing like what Jesus said get in the way of their lofty goals.  One of the most troubling aspects of their “theology” is the unbiblical teaching on spiritual warfare.  They believe they have a kingdom mandate to do “strategic-level spiritual warfare” which is “a popular charismatic method of casting out demons from geographical locations or territories.  It identifies three levels of demonic control on earth.  Firstly, are &#8220;Ground-Level&#8221; demons, which possess people.  Secondly, &#8220;Occult-Level&#8221; demons empower witches, shamans, magicians.  Finally, &#8220;Strategic-Level&#8221; demons which are the most powerful of the three, are said to rule over certain regions or territories.  Their main purpose is to hinder people from coming to Christ.”<em> </em>(<a href="http://www.deceptioninthechurch.com/orrel8.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Online source</span></a>)</p>
<p>Hence, dominionists go hither and yon to do strategic-level spiritual warfare to tear down demonic strongholds established by Satan and his demons.  This is not local; it’s global.</p>
<p>MAINSTREAMING A CULT</p>
<p>Discernment ministries such as Deception in the Church, Let Us Reason, and Herescope have been reporting on the apostate Latter Rain, now the NAR, for decades.  The Latter Rain holds that God is pouring out His Spirit just as He did at Pentecost and is using believers to prepare the world for His Second Coming.  The name has been changed numerous times.  “Presiding Apostle” C. Peter Wagner is the one who dubbed it the New Apostolic Reformation.</p>
<p>Some pro-family organizations such as the AFA, the Family Research Council and Liberty Counsel have joined forces with the NAR to fight the culture war. Until recently not many folks were paying attention – but they are now.  Why?  Because the CR has brought the NAR cult into the mainstream.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://cicministry.org/commentary/issue66b.htm" target="_blank"><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">A Warning About Latter Day Apostles</span></em></a> Herescope’s Orrel Steinkamp gives us some background info on Wagner:</p>
<p><em>This restoration teaching percolated on the back burners of the Charismatic Renewal for years, but it was never promoted heavily and no one attempted to systematically implement it on a worldwide scale.  Into this vacuum has stepped  C. Peter Wagner as a central personality.  Wagner has given organizational and promotional impetus to this so-called restoration and has taken bold steps to implement apostolic restoration to a wider Global Church&#8211;as a result he is positioned to have a greater influence than many other promoters of apostolic restoration.</em></p>
<p><em>Beginning with his association with John Wimber, Wagner moved quickly into charismatic Christianity.  He has systematized certain charismatic spiritual warfare practices and developed his strategic warfare mentality etc.  He also promoted what he called the “Third Wave.”  In this “Third Wave” he saw generic evangelicals getting involved with signs and wonders without adopting traditional Pentecostal Theology.  He has a broad Evangelical pedigree and has notoriety as a former missiologist at Fuller seminary.  He is the recognized heir and successor to Donald McGavern, the founding father of all church growth teaching.  In addition to being a co-founder of the World Prayer Center in Colorado Springs, he is the founding president of Global Harvest Ministries, which is responsible for the “United Prayer Track” of AD2000 and Beyond” as well as many other missions related activities outside the AD2000 organization.  The Billy Graham Lausan conference adopted Wagner’s missions/evangelism agenda.  And he is now in association with many holdovers from the Latter Rain of the 50’s who got a new lease on life in the Charismatic Renewal. </em></p>
<p>PINOCCHIO’S NOSE</p>
<p>In one of my articles (<a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/mwest/110518" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">here</span></a>) I said that the CR was uniting with cultists.  Wagner was indignant that I referred to the NAR as a cult. Within days he sent <em>AN URGENT MESSAGE FROM PETER to his mailing list explaining</em> what the NAR is and is not.  Is it a cult, as I claimed?  No, he said. “The NAR is definitely not a cult<em>.”  He went on to say:</em></p>
<p><em>Those who affiliate with it believe the Apostles’ Creed and all the standard classic statements of Christian doctrine. It will surprise some to know that the NAR embraces the largest non-Catholic segment of world Christianity. It is also the fastest growing segment, the only segment of Christianity currently growing faster than the world population and faster than Islam.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><strong><em>The NAR is not an organization. </em></strong><em>No one can join or carry a card. </em><strong><em>It has no leader</em></strong><em>. I have been called the “founder,” but this is not the case. One reason I might be seen as an “intellectual godfather” is that I might have been the first to observe the movement, give a name to it, and describe its characteristics as I saw them. … The roots of the NAR go back to the beginning of the African Independent Church Movement in 1900, the Chinese House Church Movement beginning in 1976, the U.S. Independent Charismatic Movement beginning in the 1970s and the Latin American Grassroots Church Movement beginning around the same time. I was neither the founder nor a member of any of these movements, </em><strong><em>I was simply a professor who observed that they were the fastest growing churches in their respective regions</em></strong><em> and that they had a number of common characteristics.” (</em></span></span><a href="http://www.globalspheres.org/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">http://www.globalspheres.org/</span></a><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;"><wbr>)</wbr></span></p>
<p>Let Us Reason’s Mike Oppenheimer responded to Wagner’s explanation in a piece he wrote <a href="http://www.letusreason.org/Latrain83.htm" target="_blank"><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">A Case of Pinocchio’s Nose</span></em></a><em>:</em></p>
<p><em>Wagner is claiming he does not want to be labeled a cult. He, as a teacher, ignores the fact that there are cults within Christianity that do confess many of the tenets of the apostle’s creed on paper, they just don’t implement them in practice.</em></p>
<p>Cult expert Walter Martin, says Oppenheimer, described a cult as “a group of people gathered about a specific persons [sic] interpretation of the bible&#8230; from a theological view point, the cults contain not only a few major deviations from historic Christianity.”<em> </em>Moreover, “A cult in its most simplistic meaning operates in falsehood, either theologically, sociologically or both (in beliefs and practices). Some are theologically dangerous others are sociologically dangerous. Not all cults are physically harmful, but <strong>they are harmful spiritually</strong>. While the cults more often operate using control, they also operate in falsehood and will have secrets that are not public. <strong>They claim to have a new or better way applied to various aspects of Christianity, more often about salvation.</strong> This aspect is seen in the NAR as they state the church will not succeed without incorporating <em>their apostles and prophets</em>.” (emphasis added)</p>
<p>TAP DANCING</p>
<p>Recently Wagner appeared on <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=140946482" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">National Public Radio’s Fresh Air</span></a>.   The tap dance he did around the truth could rival Fred Astaire who made tap dancing seem effortless.  Granted, he did answer some of host Terry Gross’ questions straightforwardly.  For example, he admitted that the NAR’s influence at <em>The Response</em> was “fairly strong and that it was a significant step forward in NAR’s work in America.”  This is a chilling thought!</p>
<p>When asked about his close friend Ted Haggard’s homosexual drug-fueled trysts with a male prostitute while pastoring the 10,000 member New Life Church, he lamented:</p>
<p><em>But when his homosexuality was revealed, it was a devastating blow to me, because not only was he pastor of this influential church, he was president of the National Association of Evangelicals. And he was a representative of all of us, and we all had a great deal of confidence in him.</em></p>
<p>When asked about the NAR’S Seven Mountain mandate, he made Fred Astaire look like a novice:</p>
<p><em>In terms of taking dominion, we don&#8217;t &#8211; we wouldn&#8217;t want to &#8211; we use the word dominion, but we wouldn&#8217;t want to say that we have dominion as if we&#8217;re the owners or we&#8217;re the rulers of, let&#8217;s say, the arts and entertainment mountain.</em></p>
<p><em>What we strive to do, and our goal is to have people in the arts and entertainment mountain who are committed to the kingdom of God. So therefore, we use the adjective they&#8217;re kingdom-minded believers, and we &#8211; our goal is to try to have as many kingdom-minded believers in positions of influence in the arts and entertainment mountain as possible. And the reason for that is to help bring the blessings of heaven to all those in the arts and entertainment mountain.</em></p>
<p>To help bring blessings?  Really?  Then why did Wagner teach the following at a conference?:</p>
<p><em>Dominion has to do with control. Dominion has to do with rulership. Dominion has to do with authority and subduing and it relates to society. In other words, what the values are in heaven need to be made manifest here on earth. Domi</em><em>nion means being the head and not the tail. Dominion means ruling as kings. It says in Revelation Chapter 1:6 that He has made us kings and priests, and check the rest of that verse.  It says “for dominion.” So we are kings for dominion.</em>   (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2woK8-y0_w&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Online source</span></a>)</p>
<p>Here’s what they mean by “ruling like kings.” <a href="http://thelittlelions.net/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Little Lions</span></a> is a dominionist website for children.  In a DVD, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=34Fxrz-YR_g#!" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Little Lion Chronicles</span></a>, producers Dave Munoz and James Nesbit tell children that the Creator gave them the name lion.  “We are strong!  We are ferocious!  We are lions!  We are recognized as kings!  We are the keepers of the Royal Way.”</p>
<p>Jesus referred to His followers, not as lions, but as sheep.  Also, the Bible says God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.  Proverbs 16:18 says “Pride <em>goeth</em> before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.”</p>
<p>The Bible also says, “Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.”</p>
<p>Why?  Because, “there are certain <strong>men crept in unawares</strong> [wormed their way in], who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, <strong>ungodly men</strong>, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and <strong>denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ</strong><em> </em>(Jude 1:3, 4).<em> </em>[emphasis added]</p>
<p>Speaking of those who have wormed their way into churches, Wagner also wrote in a newsletter:<br />
<em>The </em><a href="http://herescope.blogspot.com/2008/02/gospel-of-kingdom.html" target="_blank"><strong><em>kingdom of God </em></strong><em>furnishes the template</em></a><em> for our stream.

<p>WHAT A REVOLTING DEVELOPMENT THIS IS</p>
<p>Going back to our adroit tap dancer, C. Peter Wagner, I admit he seemed like a rational man during the NPR interview.  He did not, however, seem rational during Todd Bentley’s commissioning ceremony during the <a href="http://newswithviews.com/West/marsha69.htm" target="_blank">Lakeland Outpouring</a> when he “prophesied” over Todd, who was on stage in the prone position sizzling like a rasher of bacon:</p>
<p><em>“This commissioning represents a powerful spiritual transaction taking place in the invisible world. With this in mind, I take the apostolic authority that God has given me and I decree to Todd Bentley, your power will increase, your authority will increase, your favor will increase, your influence will increase, your revelation will increase.</em></p>
<p><em>“I also decree that a new supernatural strength will flow through this ministry. A new life force will penetrate this move of God. Government will be established to set things in their proper order. God will pour out a higher level of discernment to distinguish truth from error. New relationships will surface to open the gates to the future.” </em>(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEwsG4lsXq4" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Online source</span></a>)</p>
<p>Shortly after the televised commissioning ceremony Todd fell from grace.  It was discovered that the man who had been given apostolic authority and whom God allegedly “poured out a higher level of discernment” was having an affair with a woman on his staff (<a href="http://www.emailbrigade.com/27.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">here</span></a>).  It also came to light that the anointed one’s alcohol consumption had “crossed the line.”   To make matters worse, he divorced his wife and married his mistress.  Not to worry, though.  After repenting and going through a short but intense period of<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXNa1u87cXc" target="_blank">restoration</a> under the guidance of “super apostles” Rick Joyner and Bill Johnson, Todd was reinstated.   Now the tattooed wonder is traveling the highways and byways with his new wife “opening the gates to the future.”</p>
<p>What I’ve tried to do here is to give a brief overview of the NAR to help true followers of Jesus Christ understand what’s happening within Christendom—and this is just the tip of the iceberg, my friends!  For decades the Latter Rain was considered a fringe movement but in recent years it has wormed its way into every facet of society.  And it hasn’t been all that hard for them, and other cults, to pull the wool over the eyes of the sheep.  Sadly, this includes undiscerning Christian clergy/teachers/authors/<wbr>entertainers/media and as I pointed out, many esteemed pro-family leaders. </wbr></p>
<p>I’ll close with this verse from Hosea 4:6:</p>
<p><em>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you….</em></p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/AnarchoChristian-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/AnarchoChristian-2.jpg" alt="" /></a>On his Facebook page, Anders Behring Breivik, the Norwegian bomb attacker and shooter described himself as a Christian conservative, but police reported that he posted on nationalistic Christian fundamentalist sites.</p>
<p>A fundamentalist is anyone who has quit thinking and there is nothing Christian about that nor is there anything Christian about nationalism!</p>
<p>His lawyer said that Breivik admitted to last Friday’s shootings and “believed the actions were atrocious” but “that he wants a change in society and in his understanding, in his head, there must be a revolution.” [1]</p>
<p>Richard Ayers, a former U.S. intelligence officer now based in London, said that Breivik might have decided to strike back at the government for allowing increased Muslim migration into Norway, “And that’s what he did, he struck at the government.” [2]</p>
<p>As a Christian Anarchist, fiscal conservative and political progressive, I agree with the need for revolution and I also understand that we fight a spiritual battle that must be fought in the political realm and that no religion owns God and no church owns Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Christian anarchism combines <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism">anarchism</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity">Christianity</a> and we believe that there is only one source of authority and that authority is God as embodied in the teachings of Jesus as laid down in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon_on_the_Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Christian_anarchists">Christian anarchists</a> believe that “earthly” authority, such as government, do not and should not have power over them and we are pacifists who oppose the use of all violence-no matter who wears what uniform or how noble they believe their cause, because how can you kill when it is written in God’s commandment: “Thou shalt not murder!”</p>
<p>Anarchy is best understood as Rebellion against UNJUST laws.</p>
<p>The Yang/male force of anarchy resists authority and causes disorder and is socially and politically incorrect by the norms of the status quo for it seeks the higher ground of justice.</p>
<p>The Yin/feminine force of anarchy births a new order out of the chaos and chaos is creativity in action.</p>
<p>Christian anarchists know inner freedom comes by way of doing the teachings of Jesus for Christianity is more than a religion; it offers a new vision of life and a wide awake way of living it!</p>
<p>Christian anarchists are critical of all outer authority, be it Church or State.</p>
<p>Good and evil cut through every human heart and all Free Will means is that we get to choose which rules.</p>
<p>All individuals have free will and thus all are free to choose whether or not to also seek and knock on the door of our own heart that Jesus stands behind and that is the door of Conscience!</p>
<p>Jesus envisioned a society based on love and tolerance, which is completely incompatible with war and all violence.</p>
<p>When Jesus was mocked, whipped and nailed to a cross and remained NONVIOLENT he was over throwing the status quo of violent retaliation and eye-for-an-eye mentality.</p>
<p>Not many of his ‘followers’ have been able to drink from that cup of The Prince of Peace, which is another name for Jesus Christ who commanded his followers to LOVE all people and to forgive ones enemies in order to be forgiven-NOT bomb, shoot at, torture or militarily occupy them!</p>
<p>If there be a Christian Manifesto beyond the Sermon on the Mount, it is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kingdom_of_God_Is_Within_You">The Kingdom of God Is Within You</a></p>
<p>Tolstoy understood that the command “Thou shalt not murder” meant that all governments who wage war are directly affronting the Christian principles that should guide all life-and shouldn’t being pro-life really be about honoring the sacredness of every life that already is?</p>
<p>Tolstoy wrote to separate Orthodox Russian Christianity, which had merged with the State, for it left behind the true message of Jesus Christ, as contained in the Gospels, specifically the Sermon on the Mount.</p>
<p>Tolstoy understood that NONVIOLENCE was the solution to nationalism whose very essence reeks of superiority and that is NOT Christian.</p>
<p>Tolstoy also critiqued the heresy of the church of his time, “Nowhere nor in anything, except in the assertion of the Church, can we find that God or Christ founded anything like what churchmen understand by the Church.”</p>
<p><em>The Kingdom of God Is Within You</em> was banned in Russia and was first published in Germany in 1894. It is the culmination of thirty years of Tolstoy’s meditating-meaning thinking about the Christian life. He offered a new organization for society based on a literal interpretation of what Jesus said and when Christianity is lived rightly it looks a lot like anarchism.</p>
<p>What follows are a few excerpts [emphasis mine] from Tolstoy’s <em>THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN YOU: CHRISTIANITY NOT AS A MYSTIC RELIGION BUT AS A NEW THEORY OF LIFE</em></p>
<blockquote><p>“You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”– John 8:32</p>
<p>I do not believe, and consider as mistaken, the Church’s doctrine, which is usually called Christianity. Among the many points in which this doctrine falls short of the doctrine of Christ [is] the principal one the absence of any commandment of non-resistance to evil by force.</p>
<p>The perversion of Christ’s teaching by the teaching of the Church is more clearly apparent in this than in any other point of difference…I knew what had been said on the subject by the fathers of the Church – Origen, Tertullian, and others – I knew too of the existence of some so-called sects of Mennonites, Herrnhuters, and Quakers, who do not allow a Christian the use of weapons, and do not enter military service.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why Christ’s teaching is not understood.</p>
<p>But the principal reason, which is the source of all the other mistaken ideas about it, is the notion that Christianity is a doctrine that can be accepted or rejected without any change of life.</p>
<p>Christ’s teaching is not only a doctrine that gives rules that a man must follow, it unfolds a new meaning in life, and defines a whole world of human activity quite different from all that has preceded it and appropriate to the period on which man is entering.</p>
<p>The life of humanity changes and advances, like the life of the individual, by stages, and every stage has a theory of life appropriate to it, which is inevitably absorbed by men. Those who do not absorb it consciously, absorb it unconsciously.  It is the same with the changes in the beliefs of peoples and of all humanity as it is with the changes of belief of individuals.  If the father of a family continues to be guided in his conduct by his childish conceptions of life, life becomes so difficult for him that he involuntarily seeks another philosophy and readily absorbs that which is appropriate to his age. That is just what is happening now to humanity at this time of transition through which we are passing.</p>
<p>“It is unreasonable,” says the socialized man, “to sacrifice my welfare and that of my family and my country in order to fulfill some higher law, which requires me to renounce my most natural and virtuous feelings of love of self, of family, of kindred, and of country; and above all, it is unsafe to part with the security of life afforded by the organization of government.”</p>
<p>But the time is coming when, on one hand, the vague consciousness in his soul of the higher law, of love to God and his neighbor, and, on the other hand, the suffering, resulting from the contradictions of life, will force the man to reject the social theory and to assimilate the new one prepared ready for him, which solves all the contradictions and removes all his sufferings – the Christian theory of life.</p>
<p>And this time has now come.</p>
<p>We think today that the requirements of the Christian doctrine – of universal brotherhood, suppression of national distinctions, abolition of private property, and the strange injunction of non-resistance to evil by force – demand what is impossible.</p>
<p>The time will come – it is already coming – when the Christian principles of equality and fraternity, community of property, non-resistance of evil by force, will appear just as natural and simple as the principles of family or social life seem to us now.</p>
<p>Humanity can no more go backward in its development than the individual man.  Men have outlived the social, family, and state conceptions of life.  Now they must go forward and assimilate the next and higher conception of life, which is what is now taking place.</p>
<p>This change is brought about in two ways:  consciously through spiritual causes, and unconsciously through material causes.</p>
<p>Humanity has outgrown its social stage and has entered upon a new period.  It recognizes the doctrine that ought to be made the basis of life in this new period.  But through inertia it continues to keep up the old forms of life.  From this inconsistency between the new conception of life and practical life follows a whole succession of contradictions and sufferings that embitter our life and necessitate its alteration.</p>
<p>One need only compare the practice of life with the theory of it, to be dismayed at the glaring antagonism between our conditions of life and our conscience.</p>
<p>Our whole life is in flat contradiction with all we know, and with all we regard as necessary and right.  This contradiction runs through everything, in economic life, in political life, and in international life…we do the very opposite of all that our conscience and our common sense require of us.</p>
<p>We are guided in economical, political, and international questions by the principles that were appropriate to men of three or five thousand years ago, though they are directly opposed to our conscience and the conditions of life in which we are placed today.</p>
<p>Men of ancient and medieval times believed, firmly believed, that men are not equal, that the only true men are Persians, or Greeks, or Romans, or Franks.  But we cannot believe that now.  And people who sacrifice themselves for the principles of aristocracy and of patriotism today don’t believe and can’t believe what they assert…we know and cannot escape knowing the fundamental truth of the Christian doctrine, that we are all sons of one Father, wherever we may live and whatever language we may speak; we are all brothers and are subject to the same law of love implanted by our common Father in our hearts.</p>
<p>Whatever the opinions and degree of education of a man of today, whatever his shade of liberalism, whatever his school of philosophy, or of science, or of economics, however ignorant or superstitious he may be, every man of the present day knows that all men have an equal right to life and the good things of life, and that one set of people are no better nor worse than another, that all are equal. Everyone knows this, beyond doubt; everyone feels it in his whole being.</p>
<p>The more delicate a man’s conscience is, the more painful this contradiction is to him. A man of sensitive conscience must suffer if he lives such a life. The only means by which he can escape from this suffering is by blunting his conscience, but even if some men succeed in dulling their conscience they cannot dull their fears.</p>
<p>The men of the higher dominating classes, whose consciences are naturally not sensitive or have become blunted, if they don’t suffer through conscience, suffer from fear and hatred. They are bound to suffer.</p>
<p>A man must suffer when his whole life is defined beforehand for him by laws, which he must obey under threat of punishment, though he does not believe in their wisdom or justice, and often clearly perceives their injustice, cruelty, and artificiality.</p>
<p>The antagonism between life and the conscience may be removed in two ways:  by a change of life or by a change of conscience.</p>
<p>Christianity cannot, as its Founder said, be realized by the majority of men all at once; it must grow like a huge tree from a tiny seed.<br />
If we feel no astonishment at the contrast between our convictions and our conduct, that is because the influences, tending to obscure the contrast, produce an effect upon us too.  We need only look at our life from the point of view of that Indian, who understood Christianity in its true significance, without any compromises or concessions, we need but look at the savage brutalities of which our life is full, to be appalled at the contradictions in the midst of which we live often without observing them.</p>
<p>We need only recall the preparations for war, the machine guns, the silver-gilt bullets, the torpedoes, and – the Red Cross; the solitary prison cells, the experiments of execution by electricity – and the care of the hygienic welfare of prisoners; the philanthropy of the rich, and their life, which produces the poor they are benefiting.</p>
<p>And these inconsistencies are not, as it might seem, because men pretend to be Christians while they are really pagans, but because of something lacking in men, or some kind of force hindering them from being what they already feel themselves to be in their consciousness…We are so accustomed to the inconsistency that we do not see all the hideous folly and immorality of men voluntarily choosing the profession of butchery as though it were an honorable career. [end Tolstoy]</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Humankind has suffered too many unnecessary, fruitless agonies much akin to the throes of birth pangs for humankind has resisted the simple truth that only “the truth shall make you free.”</p>
<p>If I had to choose to pursue only one passion in my life, it is to speak truth and seek to bring in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>And the kingdom of God comes from above and it comes from within.</p>
<p>The kingdom of God is a kingdom of justice ruled by love and “<em>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, and it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with THE TRUTH! It always protects, it always trusts, always hopes, and always perseveres. Love never fails.</em>”- 1 Corinthians 13: 4-8</p>
<p>20<sup>th</sup> century Christian Anarchist, Peter Maurin penned:</p>
<p>“<em>The world would be better off if people tried to become better, and people would become better if they stopped trying to be better off. For when everyone tries to become better off nobody is better off. But when everyone tries to become better everyone is better off. Everybody would be rich if nobody tried to become richer. And nobody would be poor if everybody tried to be the poorest. And everybody would be what he ought to be if everybody tried to be what he wants the other fellow to be [and] it is about time to blow the lid off.</em>”</p>
<p>This 21<sup>st</sup> century Christian Anarchist blows the lid off the Sermon of The Mount this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>About 2,000 years ago, when Christ was about 33, he hiked up a hill and sat down under an olive tree and began to teach the people;</p>
<p>“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.”</p>
<p>In other words: it is those who know their own spiritual poverty, their own limitations and ‘sins’ [the only 'sin' is selfishness] honestly and trust God loves them in spite of themselves who already live in the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>How comforted we will all be, when we see, we haven’t got a clue, as to the depth and breadth of pure love and mercy of The Divine Mystery of The Universe.</p>
<p>God’s name in ancient Aramaic is Abba which means Daddy as much as Mommy and He/She: The Lord has said, “My ways are not your ways. My thoughts are not yours.” -Isaiah 55:8</p>
<p>Christ proclaimed more: “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.”</p>
<p>The essence of meek is to be patient with ignorance, slow to anger and never hold a grudge. In other words: how comforted you will be when you also know humility; when you know yourself, the good and the bad, for both cut through every human heart.</p>
<p>“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, they will be filled.”</p>
<p>In other words: how comforted you will be when your greatest desire is to do what “God requires, and he has already told you what that is; BE JUST, BE MERCIFUL and walk humbly with your Lord.”-Micah 6:8</p>
<p>“Blessed are the merciful, they will be shown mercy.”</p>
<p>In other words: how comforted you will all be when you choose to return only kindness to your ‘enemy.’</p>
<p>“For with the measure you measure against another, it will be measured back to you” Christ warns his disciples as he explains the law of karma in Luke 6:27-38.</p>
<p>“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they see God.”</p>
<p>In other words: how comforted you will be when you WAKE UP and see God is already within you, within every man, every woman and every child. The Supreme Being is everywhere, the Alpha and Omega, beginning and end. Beyond The Universe -and yet so small; within the heart of every atom.</p>
<p>“Blessed are The Peacemakers: THEY shall be called the children of God.”</p>
<p>And what a wonderful world it would be when we all seek peace by pursuing justice; for there can be none without the other.</p>
<p>“Blessed are those who are persecuted because they do what God requires, theirs is The Kingdom of Heaven.”</p>
<p>And one fine day the lion will lie down with The Lamb and man will make war no more; and thus create the Kingdom of God on planet earth.</p>
<p>And I pray: GODSPEED on it!</p></blockquote>
