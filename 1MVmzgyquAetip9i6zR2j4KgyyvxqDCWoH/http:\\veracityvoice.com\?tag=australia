<h3 style="color: #222222;">The question is not what pacifism has achieved throughout history, but what has war achieved?</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">Remark made to a pacifist: “If only everyone else would live in the way you recommend, I would gladly live that way as well – but not until everyone else does.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The Pacifist’s reply: “Why then, sir, you would be the last man on earth to do good. I would rather be one of the first.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, 1947, words long cherished by a large majority of the Japanese people:</p>
<blockquote style="color: #222222;">
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">“Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">“In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #222222;">This statement is probably unique amongst the world’s constitutions.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">But on July 1, 2014 the government of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, without changing a word of Article 9, announced a “reinterpretation” of it to allow for military action in conjunction with allies. This decision can be seen as the culmination of a decades-long effort by the United States to wean Japan away from its post-WW2 pacifist constitution and foreign policy and set it back on the righteous path of being a military power once again, only this time acting in coordination with US foreign policy needs.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In the triumphalism of the end of the Second World War, the American occupation of Japan, in the person of General Douglas MacArthur, played a major role in the creation of this constitution. But after the communists came to power in China in 1949, the United States opted for a strong Japan safely ensconced in the anti-communist camp. For pacifism, it’s been downhill ever since … step by step … MacArthur himself ordered the creation of a “national police reserve”, which became the embryo of the future Japanese military … visiting Tokyo in 1956, US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles told Japanese officials: “In the past, Japan had demonstrated her superiority over the Russians and over China. It was time for Japan to think again of being and acting like a Great Power.”  … various US-Japanese security and defense cooperation treaties, which called on Japan to integrate its military technology with that of the US and NATO … the US supplying new sophisticated military aircraft and destroyers … all manner of Japanese logistical assistance to the US in Washington’s frequent military operations in Asia … repeated US pressure on Japan to increase its military budget and the size of its armed forces … more than a hundred US military bases in Japan, protected by the Japanese military … US-Japanese joint military exercises and joint research on a missile defense system … the US Ambassador to Japan, 2001: “I think the reality of circumstances in the world is going to suggest to the Japanese that they reinterpret or redefine Article 9.”  … Under pressure from Washington, Japan sent several naval vessels to the Indian Ocean to refuel US and British warships as part of the Afghanistan campaign in 2002, then sent non-combat forces to Iraq to assist the American war as well as to East Timor, another made-in-America war scenario … US Secretary of State Colin Powell, 2004: “If Japan is going to play a full role on the world stage and become a full active participating member of the Security Council, and have the kind of obligations that it would pick up as a member of the Security Council, Article Nine would have to be examined in that light.”  …</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In 2012 Japan was induced to take part in a military exercise with 21 other countries, converging on Hawaii for the largest-ever Rim of the Pacific naval exercises and war games, with a Japanese admiral serving as vice commander of the combined task force.  And so it went … until, finally, on July 1 of this year, the Abe administration announced their historic decision. Abe, it should be noted, is a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, with which the CIA has had a long and intimate connection, even when party leaders were convicted World War 2 war criminals.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">If and when the American empire engages in combat with China or Russia, it appears that Washington will be able to count on their Japanese brothers-in-arms. In the meantime, the many US bases in Japan serve as part of the encirclement of China, and during the Vietnam War the United States used their Japanese bases as launching pads to bomb Vietnam.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The US policies and propaganda not only got rid of the annoying Article 9, but along the way it gave rise to a Japanese version of McCarthyism. A prime example of this is the case of Kimiko Nezu, a 54-year-old Japanese teacher, who was punished by being transferred from school to school, by suspensions, salary cuts, and threats of dismissal because of her refusal to stand during the playing of the national anthem, a World War II song chosen as the anthem in 1999. She opposed the song because it was the same one sung as the Imperial Army set forth from Japan calling for an “eternal reign” of the emperor. At graduation ceremonies in 2004, 198 teachers refused to stand for the song. After a series of fines and disciplinary actions, Nezu and nine other teachers were the only protesters the following year. Nezu was then allowed to teach only when another teacher was present.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">Yankee Blowback</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">The number of children attempting to cross the Mexican border into the United States has risen dramatically in the last five years: In fiscal year 2009 (October 1, 2009 &#8211; September 30, 2010) about 6,000 unaccompanied minors were detained near the border. The US Department of Homeland Security estimates for the fiscal year 2014 the detention of as many as 74,000 unaccompanied minors. Approximately 28% of the children detained this year are from Honduras, 24% from Guatemala, and 21% from El Salvador. The particularly severe increases in Honduran migration are a direct result of the June 28, 2009 military coup that overthrew the democratically-elected president, Manuel Zelaya, after he did things like raising the minimum wage, giving subsidies to small farmers, and instituting free education. The coup – like so many others in Latin America – was led by a graduate of Washington’s infamous School of the Americas.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">As per the standard Western Hemisphere script, the Honduran coup was followed by the abusive policies of the new regime, loyally supported by the United States. The State Department was virtually alone in the Western Hemisphere in not unequivocally condemning the Honduran coup. Indeed, the Obama administration has refused to call it a coup, which, under American law, would tie Washington’s hands as to the amount of support it could give the coup government. This denial of reality still persists even though a US embassy cable released by Wikileaks in 2010 declared: “There is no doubt that the military, Supreme Court and National Congress conspired on June 28 [2009] in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch”. Washington’s support of the far-right Honduran government has been unwavering ever since.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The questions concerning immigration into the United States from south of the border go on year after year, with the same issues argued back and forth: What’s the best way to block the flow into the country? How shall we punish those caught here illegally? Should we separate families, which happens when parents are deported but their American-born children remain? Should the police and various other institutions have the right to ask for proof of legal residence from anyone they suspect of being here illegally? Should we punish employers who hire illegal immigrants? Should we grant amnesty to at least some of the immigrants already here for years? … on and on, round and round it goes, decade after decade. Those in the US generally opposed to immigration make it a point to declare that the United States does not have any moral obligation to take in these Latino immigrants.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">But the counter-argument to this last point is almost never mentioned: Yes, the United States does indeed have a moral obligation because so many of the immigrants are escaping a situation in their homeland made hopeless by American intervention and policy. In addition to Honduras, Washington overthrew progressive governments which were sincerely committed to fighting poverty in Guatemala and Nicaragua; while in El Salvador the US played a major role in suppressing a movement striving to install such a government. And in Mexico, though Washington has not intervened militarily since 1919, over the years the US has been providing training, arms, and surveillance technology to Mexico’s police and armed forces to better their ability to suppress their own people’s aspirations, as in Chiapas, and this has added to the influx of the oppressed to the United States, irony notwithstanding.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Moreover, Washington’s North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has brought a flood of cheap, subsidized US agricultural products into Mexico, ravaging campesino communities and driving many Mexican farmers off the land when they couldn’t compete with the giant from the north. The subsequent Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) has brought the same joys to the people of that area.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">These “free trade” agreements – as they do all over the world – also result in government enterprises being privatized, the regulation of corporations being reduced, and cuts to the social budget. Add to this the displacement of communities by foreign mining projects and the drastic US-led militarization of the War on Drugs with accompanying violence and you have the perfect storm of suffering followed by the attempt to escape from suffering.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">It’s not that all these people prefer to live in the United States. They’d much rather remain with their families and friends, be able to speak their native language at all times, and avoid the hardships imposed on them by American police and other right-wingers.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">M’lady Hillary</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">Madame Clinton, in her new memoir, referring to her 2002 Senate vote supporting military action in Iraq, says: “I thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had. And I wasn’t alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong. Plain and simple.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In a 2006 TV interview, Clinton said: “Obviously, if we knew then what we know now, there wouldn’t have been a vote. And I certainly wouldn’t have voted that way.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">On October 16, 2002 the US Congress adopted a joint resolution titled “Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq”. This was done in the face of numerous protests and other political events against an American invasion.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">On February 15, 2003, a month before the actual invasion, there was a coordinated protest around the world in which people in some 60 countries marched in a last desperate attempt to stop the war from happening. It has been described as “the largest protest event in human history.” Estimations of the total number of participants involved reach 30 million. The protest in Rome involved around three million people, and is listed in the 2004 Guinness Book of World Records as the largest anti-war rally in history. Madrid hosted the second largest rally with more than 1½ million protesters. About half a million marched in the United States. How many demonstrations in support of the war can be cited? It can be said that the day was one of humanity’s finest moments.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">So what did all these people know that Hillary Clinton didn’t know? What information did they have access to that she as a member of Congress did not have?</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The answer to both questions is of course “Nothing”. She voted the way she did because she was, as she remains today, a wholly committed supporter of the Empire and its unending wars.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">And what did the actual war teach her? Here she is in 2007, after four years of horrible death, destruction and torture:</p>
<blockquote style="color: #222222;">
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">“The American military has done its job. Look what they accomplished. They got rid of Saddam Hussein. They gave the Iraqis a chance for free and fair elections. They gave the Iraqi government the chance to begin to demonstrate that it understood its responsibilities to make the hard political decisions necessary to give the people of Iraq a better future. So the American military has succeeded.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #222222;">And she spoke the above words at a conference of liberals, committed liberal Democrats and others further left. She didn’t have to cater to them with any flag-waving pro-war rhetoric; they wanted to hear anti-war rhetoric (and she of course gave them a tiny bit of that as well out of the other side of her mouth), so we can assume that this is how she really feels, if indeed the woman feels anything. The audience, it should be noted, booed her, for the second year in a row.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">“We came, we saw, he died.” – Hillary Clinton as US Secretary of State, <em>giggling</em>, as she referred to the uncivilized and utterly depraved murder of Moammar Gaddafi in 2011.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Imagine Osama bin Laden or some other Islamic leader speaking of September 11, 2001: “We came, we saw, 3,000 died, ha-ha.”</p>

<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Culprits Include The City Of Chicago, Big Retailers, The Media, And Churches&#8230;</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Proponents of the Nanny State have been trying to take away man’s Natural right of self-defense ever since the United Nations was created back in 1945. Of course, the Natural right of self-defense is totally unknown in communist and socialist countries; and big-government toadies in several so-called “democratic” countries have also succeeded in turning citizens into subjects by removing or severely restricting the Natural right of self-defense. Obviously, I’m talking about countries such as Great Britain, France, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">By self-defense, I am talking about a man’s right to carry a Personal Defense Weapon (PDW)&#8211;which, in modern times, mostly requires a firearm&#8211;anywhere and everywhere he goes. A state that does not allow a man to be personally armed in his day-to-day activities is literally stripping him of his right of self-defense. To require a citizen to keep his or her PDW in their home or vehicle is to deny the citizen’s Natural right of self-defense. To say a citizen may lawfully protect himself in only limited and duly-prescribed locations is to make the citizen a subject of the state. Furthermore, it removes from him the most fundamental of all the Natural rights that were granted to him by his Creator: the right of self-defense.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Four-legged predators are constantly on the prowl for animals that are defenseless. Two-legged predators do the same thing. These human predators do not respect “gun-free” zones. Like all predators, they are opportunistic beasts. They prey on the weak and vulnerable. When the state takes away a person’s right to be always armed, it makes the entire citizenry weak and vulnerable. As I have said many times, guns don’t kill people; gun-free zones kill people.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Gun control laws are among the most egregious violations of Natural Law. Men and women who are truly free are allowed to carry a PDW everywhere they go. Banks, schools, government buildings, churches, etc., should be no exceptions. It is no coincidence that just about every single mass-shooting in recent memory has taken place in a so-called “gun-free” zone, where the only people who were armed were the perpetrators. Gun-free zones turn free men into human prey.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For all intents and purposes, several states and major cities within the United States have become “gun-free” zones, in that they mostly deny their citizens the right to carry a PDW on their person. Whether the people of these cities and states realize it or not, they have lost the right to be called free men and have been turned into human prey by their own State and municipal governments. There is no greater example of this tyranny than the city of Chicago, Illinois.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Chicago has some of the strictest and most stringent gun-control laws in the entire nation. The government of Chicago has, in effect, turned the town into a giant killing-field where ravenous two-legged beasts are allowed to feast on the millions of defenseless prey that inhabit our country’s third largest city. For example, over the past Independence Day weekend, 82 people were shot and 14 people were killed in Chicago violence. Breitbart.com covered the story:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Breitbart reported that the violence was high on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning, but when Thursday, the final hours of Sunday, and the first few hours of Monday morning were added to the accounting, the rate of violence proved to be even more appalling.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“On Monday morning, July 7, the Chicago Tribune shocked the city with the list of weekend violence reporting that between Thursday, as the holiday weekend began, to the early hours of Monday morning, Chicago experienced 82 shootings with 14 killed.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Included in the Breitbart report is the fact that one man’s life was actually saved by virtue of the fact that he had a concealed carry permit (no small feat in the City of Chicago) and used his PDW to protect himself against three violent miscreants. In this case, one of the dead was a violent predator. Had the innocent citizen not been armed, he would have been the statistic. In addition, the report states that eight of the dead were at the hands of Chicago police officers in the line of duty, proving, once again, that policemen carry guns, not for the protection of the citizenry, but for their own protection.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Predictably, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel blamed the increased violence on “weak” gun laws in the neighboring states of Indiana and Wisconsin.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">See the Breitbart.com report here:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2FBig-Government%2F2014%2F07%2F07%2FBetween-Thursday-and-Sunday-82-shot-and-14-Killed-in-Chicago-Violence&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHbYRQWw327UOpyIrUcdH-hESHBLA" target="_blank">Between Thursday And Monday 82 Shot, 14 Killed In Chicago Violence</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, what Emanuel won’t tell you is that the violent crime rates of those states where the right to keep AND BEAR arms is less infringed are far less&#8211;far less! For example, there are 11 states in the country that allow their citizens to carry firearms freely and openly with no permit or license required. Those states are Alaska, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, South Dakota, Vermont, Kentucky, and Virginia. So, using Emanuel’s logic, one could expect that there should have been hundreds of shootings in those states last weekend&#8211;what with their “weak” gun laws and all, right? You know that’s not true.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Check the incidents of shootings in the above-listed states and we might even discover that the City of Chicago may have had more shootings over this past Independence Day weekend than those 11 states COMBINED. Think of it: the City of Chicago (with some of the strictest gun control laws in the country) may have had more shootings than the combined shootings of the 11 states that recognize their citizens’ Natural right of self-defense by allowing them to freely and openly carry a PDW.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, it’s not only various and sundry governments (though they are the most egregious usurpers of the Natural right of self-defense) that want to deny people the right to bear arms; many large retailers are adding their weight to the anti-self-defense hysteria.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Just a few days ago, the giant retailer, Target, announced a corporate policy that asks its patrons to leave their firearms at home. Once again, Breitbart.com covers the story.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“On July 2nd, Target ‘respectfully’ asked law-abiding citizens to ‘not bring firearms’ in their stores.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“The department store chain did this via an announcement posted on its website and shared by interim CEO John Mulligan.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“The announcement says:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“‘As you&#8217;ve likely seen in the media, there&#8217;s been a debate about whether guests in communities that permit &#8220;open carry&#8221; should be allowed to bring firearms into Target stores. Our approach has always been to follow local laws, and of course, we will continue to do so. But starting today we will respectfully request that guests not bring firearms to Target&#8211;even in communities where it is permitted by law.’</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“By taking this step, Target joins Chipotle, Jack in the Box, Sonic, and Chili&#8217;s in asking law-abiding citizens not to carry guns in their businesses.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The author of the report, AWR Hawkins, notes, “Within two weeks of asking law-abiding customers to come unarmed, two Jack in the Box stores were robbed, and a shooting took place at a third. Patrons were robbed at gunpoint in one of the robberies, as well.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">See the report at:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2FBig-Government%2F2014%2F07%2F02%2FTarget-Respectfully-Asks-Law-Abiding-Citizens-To-Leave-Guns-At-Home&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGgCaOXlkzBuCjOparrSfzdp7f3Wg" target="_blank">Target ‘Respectfully’ Asks Law-Abiding Citizens To Leave Guns At Home</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But the war against your Natural right to self-defense doesn’t stop with the City of Chicago or the Target chain-stores. The mainstream media seem absolutely determined to take away your right to defend yourself and your loved ones.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">After CNN sacked Piers Morgan due to his immense unpopularity, which was mostly due to his arrogant attacks against America’s Second Amendment, the cable network recently announced that it was replacing Morgan with former America’s Most Wanted host, John Walsh, who immediately proclaimed that his show would continue Morgan’s attacks against the Second Amendment.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Once more, Breitbart.com covers the story:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Former America&#8217;s Most Wanted host John Walsh is hosting a new show on CNN on which he vows to keep the push for gun control and the war on the NRA alive.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“According to The Wrap, Walsh said:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“‘I&#8217;m the father of a murdered child. I&#8217;ve done nothing but track violence in America since my son was murdered. We have a serious problem with guns in this country&#8230; and the NRA solution to arm every grammar-school 80-year-old teacher with a gun is absolutely ludicrous.’</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“He claims the NRA has gotten so big and financially powerful through relationships with gun manufacturers that ‘they&#8217;re not a lobbyist on Capitol Hill, they&#8217;re a gun manufacturer rep.’</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Walsh&#8217;s new show, The Hunt, premieres July 13. Walsh says he did not initially realize ‘how much his gun control efforts would be a part of his new show.’”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">See the report at:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2FBig-Journalism%2F2014%2F07%2F07%2FNew-CNN-Host-John-Walsh-Vows-To-Continue-Piers-Morgan-s-War-On-The-NRA&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGwfmG2vLNr1MOFV5FaffJTRQma1Q" target="_blank">New CNN Host John Walsh Vows To Continue Piers Morgan’s War On The NRA</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Obviously, CNN is hoping that it’s continued anti-Second Amendment agenda will be more palatable to the American people if it comes from a fellow American&#8211;especially one with whom everyone can truly sympathize with by virtue of his losing a child to an act of violence (although Adam Walsh’s murder did not involve the use of a firearm)&#8211;than from the arrogant and pompous British elitist, Piers Morgan. But make no mistake about it: the anti-Second Amendment message is the same. Only the messenger has changed.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And most sadly, churches, too, are often at the forefront of the anti-self-defense fanaticism. Christian leaders from denominations across the board are often the ones who promote gun control (even gun confiscation) among their congregations and who deny their parishioners the right to be armed on church property.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For example, back in 2004, the president of the LDS church issued a declaration to all Mormon churches in Utah that gave “public notice that firearms are prohibited in the church’s houses of worship, including temples, meetinghouses, the Assembly Hall, the Salt Lake Tabernacle, and the Conference Center.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The declaration went on to say, “Once such public notice is given, persons who bring firearms into a church house of worship should be informed of the church’s position and politely asked to take their firearms to another safe location. Persons who refuse to take their firearms from the house of worship or repeatedly ignore the church’s prohibition should be referred to local law enforcement officers for possible criminal prosecution.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">See the church statement here:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.deseretnews.com%2Farticle%2F590038317%2FText-of-letter-from-First-Presidency-on-guns.html%3Fpg%3Dall&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHuqhHjI2590O9spLI-XV5JN1DZyg" target="_blank">Text Of Letter From First Presidency On Guns</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But if you think the LDS church is the only church in the country that has taken such a position, you are sadly misinformed. My educated guess is that the vast majority of denominations and churches in America have a very similar position.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But instead of denying the Christian people of America from exercising their God-given right of self-defense on church property, church leaders should be boldly teaching the Biblical Natural Law principles of self-defense and encouraging their people to jealously guard this most fundamental liberty. By demanding that Christian people not be armed on church property, church leaders are no better than Rahm Emanuel&#8211;who insists that Chicago’s residents not be allowed to protect themselves&#8211;and are opening up their churches to those two-legged wolves who would seek to devour the sheep.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There are only a small handful of countries today that recognize the Natural right of self-defense. The advent of the United Nations has facilitated the demise of this right in country after country. The United States is the last major power that yet somewhat protects this most precious Natural right.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Obviously, several State and local governments within the United States (not to mention the worst offender of all: the federal government in Washington, D.C.) have themselves assisted the dismantlement of the right of self-defense. Several giant retailers are assisting the attacks against our Natural right of self-defense. The mainstream media is incessant in its attacks against the Second Amendment. And even many of America’s churches have set themselves against the right to BEAR arms. The war against our Natural right of self-defense continues.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">However, I need to point out that the architects of the Nanny State have been trying to disarm the American people since even before the United Nations was created. And while the right to keep and bear arms has been severely restricted by myriads of federal, State, and local laws, the American people continue to be the most heavily armed people in the world. Not only is the American citizenry an armed citizenry, it is an absolutely determined citizenry. The message to any and all potential tyrants who would attempt to remove our Natural right of self-defense is the same&#8211;whether they are from King George’s London, Mao’s Beijing, Stalin’s Moscow, Emanuel’s Chicago, Obama’s Washington, D.C., or the U.N.’s New York City: MOLON LABE, COME AND TAKE THEM!</p>

<p>Central banks have shifted into stocks and are buying up everything that isn’t bolted to the floor.</p>
<p>That’s the gist of the story that breathlessly appeared in the Financial Times about a week ago and swept across the blogosphere like a Santa Anna brushfire. And there’s some truth to it too, if taken with a large grain of salt. Here’s a clip from the Omfif’s report the FT’s cites in the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>“A cluster of central banking investors has become major players on world equity markets,” says a report to be published this week by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (Omfif), a central bank research and advisory group. The trend “could potentially contribute to overheated asset prices”, it warns.” (Financial Times)</p></blockquote>
<p>So, there you have it; stocks are rising, central banks are buying stocks like mad, therefore, central banks are driving the market. That’s all there is to it, right?</p>
<p>And we’re not talking chump change here either. According to the Omfif”s press release “global central banks and public sector institutions now account for an eye-watering “$29.1tn worth of investments … in 162 countries.”</p>
<p>Hmm. It’s easy to read that statement and assume that central banks have purchased $29 trillion in stocks, isn’t it? That’s what the folks over at Zero Hedge did. Check out the headline they ran shortly after the story appeared in the FT: “Cluster Of Central Banks” Have Secretly Invested $29 Trillion In The Market” (Zero Hedge)</p>
<p>But that’s not what the press release says, is it? It says “global central banks and public sector institutions”. There’s a big difference between the stocks a bank buys and all the investments in public pension funds, 401Ks, sovereign wealth funds etc. A huge difference. It looks like someone might be engaging in a bit of fear-mongering to get a rise out of readers.</p>
<p>That’s not to downplay the fact that CB’s are distorting prices by playing the market. They are. No one disputes that. Just like no one disputes that central banks should limit their activities to doing their job, which is maintaining price stability. (We’re deliberately omitting “full employment” since the Fed thinks it’s a big joke anyway.) But, hey, everyone knows these guys are a dodgy lot to begin with, so it’s hard to get whipped up into a lather every time they get caught in some new flimflam. Besides CB stock purchases are likely insignificant compared to corporate stock buybacks which are presently just-south of $600 billion per year. CB stock purchases are no where near that, regardless of what you read at Zero Hedge. Check this out in the Wall Street Journal:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Last year, the corporations in the Russell 3000, a broad U.S. stock index, repurchased $567.6 billion worth of their own shares—a 21% increase over 2012, calculates Rob Leiphart, an analyst at Birinyi Associates, a research firm in Westport, Conn. That brings total buybacks since the beginning of 2005 to $4.21 trillion—or nearly one-fifth of the total value of all U.S. stocks today.” (<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/21/will-stock-buybacks-bite-back/">Will Stock Buybacks Bite Back?</a>, Wall Street Journal)</p></blockquote>
<p>Yikes. “$4.21 trillion”! Now that’s what you call froth.</p>
<p>Anyway, the reason CBs are buying equities is to hedge their losses on the mountain of low-yielding bonds they purchased in their effort to recapitalize the insolvent banking system. They’re already taking it in the shorts for an estimated $250 billion per year, and when rates start marching upward, (as they inevitably will) they’re going to be bleeding red ink from both eyeballs. That’s why they want to diversify their portfolio; to staunch the hemorrhaging. Even so, the whole matter looks shabby and underhanded, which of course it is. It also calls into question present stock valuations which have been soaring with the zero rates, QE and positive earnings reports, the trifecta which pushes equities into the stratosphere regardless of the shitty condition of the underlying “real” economy. So–just like everyone else–the banks want to get on the winning side of the trade. But what a firestorm they’ve set off with these latest shenanigans! Here’s a sample of the outrage you’ll find on the Internet. This is from a Bill Bonner article titled “Proof the Stock Market Is Being Rigged”:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are still reeling.<br />
Yesterday, we reported that central banks are major buyers of stocks…<br />
We hardly know where to begin…</p>
<p>Outraged, we sputter and spit… we search for words… we look for metaphors and narratives… anything that will put this extraordinary situation in the right light…</p>
<p>Ah yes… central banks create new money… it gets passed around the financial community in many ways… and ultimately ends up in the equity markets…</p>
<p>In short, a grand slam of deceit. The World Series of financial catastrophe will follow. But that could be a long way off.” (<a href="http://www.bonnerandpartners.com/proof-the-stock-market-is-being-rigged/#.U6rqCcLjjcu">Proof the Stock Market Is Being Rigged</a>, Bonner and Partners)</p></blockquote>
<p>“A grand slam of deceit”?</p>
<p>Fair enough. A little hyperbolic, but that’s to be expected, right? But, c’mon now, given the long list of scandals in the last few years–High-Frequency Trading (HFT), “toxic” mortgage-backed securities, Libor, London Whale, Robo-signing, structured finance, Madoff etc etc–it’s hard not to be little blasé about the whole deal, isn’t it? I’m not sure where Bonner’s been, but if you were to ask Joe Blow on the street, whether he thought the “market was rigged or not”, he’d undoubtedly nod his head affirmatively as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. Because it is the most obvious thing in the world. Heidi Moore summed it up pretty well in a recent article at the Gurdian. She said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Most Americans don’t think much about the stock market, and that’s just fine with Wall Street. Because once you wake up to how screwed up the stock market really is, the financial industry knows you’re likely to get very nervous and take your money out.</p>
<p>Many are catching on: between 2007 and 2014, investors pulled $345bn from the stock market. E-Trades are down and worries are up, with 73% of Americans still not inclined to buy stocks, five years after the financial crisis…</p>
<p>Let’s get one thing straight: Investor confidence is not the problem. The screwed-up stock market is the problem. It’s time to break down the polite fiction that investing in the stock market is something that sane, rational, sensible people do. It is a high-risk contact sport for your money…</p>
<p>The US stock market depends entirely on the ignorance of regular people who are supposed to just shovel their money into retirement funds and 401(k)s, pay a whopping one-third of your retirement in fees to high-priced managers, and never whisper a complaint.</p>
<p>It’s a wonder that anyone (trusts the market) at all.” (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/22/wall-street-washington-stock-market-rigged-investors">Wall Street and Washington want you to believe the stock market isn’t rigged. Guess what? It still is,</a> Heidi Moore, Guardian)</p></blockquote>
<p>The market is totally rigged from stem to stern, which is why it is so hard to feign outrage at this latest sign of corruption. It’s just par for the course. What we found more interesting, was the OMFIF’s contention that the experimental monetary policies, the centrals banks initiated to deal with the Financial Crisis, have changed the system to what the author calls “state capitalism”.</p>
<p>“Whether or not this trend is a good thing”, he opines, “may be open to question. What is incontestable is that it has happened”.</p>
<p>While you can’t expect the media to cover something like this, it’s certainly worth mulling over. The fact is, CBs have taken over economic policy altogether. They’re running the whole shooting match. The various congresses and parliaments across the western world now merely act as a rubber stamp for the austerity measures demanded by their corporate bosses. Fiscal policy is a dead letter in the US, Japan, Australia, Canada, UK and the Eurozone. Everywhere the bank cartel has extended it’s grip, fiscal policy has been jettisoned altogether. It’s bailouts and lavish subsidies for the 1 percenters and belt-tightening, shock therapy for everyone else. Isn’t that how it works? State Capitalism isn’t a conspiracy theory. It’s just class warfare taken to the next level. Check this out from Dave Marsh at Marketwatch:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Central banks’ foreign-exchange reserves have grown unprecedentedly fast, especially in the developing world. The same authorities that are responsible for maintaining financial stability are often the owners of the large funds that add to liquidity in many markets…</p>
<p>Evidence of an increase in equity-buying by central banks and other public-sector investors has emerged from a survey of publicly owned or managed investments compiled by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF)… There are worries that central banks may be over-stretching themselves by operating in too many areas.</p>
<p>Jens Weidmann, president of Germany’s Bundesbank — spoke yearningly last week of the need for “central banks to shed their role as decision-makers of last resort and, thus, to return to their normal business.”</p>
<p>He said this “would help to preserve the independence of central banks, which is a key precondition to maintaining price stability in the long run.” (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/central-banks-becoming-major-investors-in-stock-markets-2014-06-16">Central banks becoming major investors in stock markets</a>, Dave Marsh, Marketwatch)</p></blockquote>
<p>You might want to read that first part over again to savor what the author is saying. Here it is: “The same authorities that are responsible for maintaining financial stability are often the owners of the large funds that add to liquidity in many markets.”</p>
<p>That’s what you call corruption with a capital “C”. But then the author does a 180 and waxes-on about “preserving the independence of central banks, which is a key precondition to maintaining price stability in the long run.”</p>
<p>Right. The whole independence thing is a big joke. Why would anyone in their right mind bestow such extraordinary powers (“independence”) on a group of voracious, cutthroat bankers who have repeatedly shown that they can’t be trusted?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>It’s insanity. This latest outrage just proves that the central bank system needs to be either reformed or terminated. Preferably, terminated.</p>

<p><em>This is one in a series of articles taken from eyewitness testimony before the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels. Five international judges are examining evidence of child rape, torture, murder and kidnapping allegedly done by global elite members of the Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult network. Regular Ninth Circle child sacrifices were said to take place in the catacombs of Catholic Cathedrals, the Vatican, on private estates and groves and government military bases in Belgium, Holland, Spain, Australia, Ireland, France, England and the US. At least 34 child mass grave sites were identified in Ireland, Spain and Canada – and refused excavation by the respective governments, Crown of England and Catholic Church. Named as present in Ninth Circle activities were Pope Francis, former Pope Ratzinger;Anglican, United Church of Canada and Catholic Church officials including Cardinals; members of European royalty including Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip; officials of the Canadian, Australian, UK and US military and governments including the USA’s CIA, plus prominent government ministers, judges, politicians and businessmen from the US, Belgium, Holland, Canada, Australia, France, Ireland and the UK.</em></p>
<p>Teens were drugged, stripped naked, raped, hunted down in the woods and killed by European royals according to this week’s latest eyewitness to testify before the<a title="International Common Law Court of Justice" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhirLohgDRc&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels</a>. The woman was <a title="the fourth eyewitness" href="http://iclcj.com/" target="_blank">the fourth eyewitness</a> to give accounts about these human hunting parties of the global elite Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult network. A former member of the Netherlands criminal drug syndicate known as Octopus testified that victims were obtained for these human hunting parties from juvenile detention centers in Belgium and Holland.</p>
<p>“In 2004 I was an involuntary witness to torture, rape and murder sessions of drugged children performed for a group of high ranked people of the Netherlands” stated a woman. “I was taken to a hunting party in Belgium close to Brussels where I saw two boys and a girl ages 14 to 16, hunted and killed by global elites. The human hunting party was heavily guarded by the Netherlands Royal Guards. I was told that King Albert of Belgium was present.”</p>
<p>Four eyewitnesses confirmed that as children and youths they were forced to attend human hunting parties where they and other children were raped, with some killed, and deceased boy’s penises were cut off. Allegedly there was a Dutch countryside palace where boys’ penises were displayed like trophies on a wall. Some hunting parties were hosted on the grounds of Belgium Queen Beatrix’s Palace.</p>
<p>Dutch therapist <a title="Toss Nijenhuis" href="http://youtu.be/-A1o1Egi20c" target="_blank">Toos Nijenhuis</a> claimed that as a four year-old she was forced to witness murders of children that involved former Pope Ratzinger, a Dutch Catholic Cardinal, plus the father of Netherlands Belgium Queen Beatrix and Bilderberger Founder, Dutch Crown Prince Alfrink Bernhard. “I saw the former Pope Joseph Ratzinger murder a little girl″ another witness confirmed. “It was at a French chateau in the fall of 1987. It was ugly, horrible and didn’t happen just once. Ratzinger and Bernhard were some of the more prominent men who took part.”</p>
<p>In Ireland, Spain and Canada 34 child mass grave sites were discovered and appeared linked to Ninth Circle activities. The largest was the Mohawk Indian Residential School in Brantford Ontario where child remains were identified in 2008 before the Catholic Church, Canadian government and English Crown shut down the dig by professional archeologists. The 2013 ICLCJ Court had found Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip guilty for the Oct. 10 1964 disappearance of ten native children from the Catholic residential school in Kamloops British Columbia. In the first two weeks of the 2014 court witnesses identified Dutch and Belgian royal participants in the rape and killing of Mohawk children and newborns. Named were Bernhard and King Hendrick, consort to Queen Wilhelmina of Holland.</p>
<p>Alleged to be present during the human hunting parties were the late Prince Johan Friso and his wife Mabel Wisse Smit, former ministers, the top man of the Dutch army, the under secretary of the Raad Van State in the Netherlands, the Vice-Roy next to Queen Beatrix and other global business and political leaders including some from the US. “Surely the present King Willem Alexander and King Filip and their wives know about this abuse and murder of children” said one eyewitness.”They do nothing about it and likely are the ones to stop investigations and prosecutions.”</p>
<p>In January 2014 the brother of the king of Holland Prince Johan Friso passed away in a coma after these three Dutch-language <a title="websites" href="http://capoditutticapi007.blogspot.nl/" target="_blank">websites</a> <a title="shown" href="http://capoditutticapi008.blogspot.nl/" target="_blank">shown</a> <a title="shown" href="http://capoditutticapi009.blogspot.nl/" target="_blank">here</a> reached the internet. The websites revealed that Friso was at the human hunting and killing parties.”The story came on the internet after years of trying to move the policy and justice department in the Netherlands to act against the criminals,” an eyewitness said. “Nobody did anything to stop these criminals, probably because Queen Beatrix and King Albert likely interfered with the investigations.”</p>
<p>Human hunting parties were said to take place on the grounds of Belgium Queen Beatrix’s Palace in the Netherlands. Two witnesses have named former Pope Joseph Ratzinger and Queen Beatrix’s father the deceased <a title="Prince Alfrink Bernhard" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/7377402/Dutch-Prince-Bernhard-was-member-of-Nazi-party.html" target="_blank">Prince Alfrink Bernhard</a>, as being present at child sacrifices. Both were said to be Nazi sympathizers.</p>
<p>The ICLCJ Court received a collection of Jesuit archival records about a child sacrificial cult known as the Knights of Darkness. In 1933 the Knights were established by the Catholic Jesuits and Nazi Waffen S.S. Division. The records showed Ratzinger was identified as a member of the Knights while working as an S.S. Chaplain’s assistant at the Ravensbruck Concentration Camp in Germany. The records also stated that Ratzinger participated in child sacrificial rites using kidnapped children from the camps or political prisoners.</p>
<p>Another court document called the Magisterial Privilege indicated child sacrifice was a regular occurrence at the Vatican. At the tender age of 12 “Svali” of San Diego County California claimed she was brought to catacombs beneath the Vatican to witness the sacrifice of a three year-old drugged boy. <a title="In this video" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZccxuKjXApA" target="_blank">In this video</a> her interviewer said that 24 years prior a “Maria” told him she witnessed another satanic child sacrifice rite in the same Vatican Catacombs.</p>
<p>Last week an Irish police investigator reported to the ICLCJ Court that the close to 800 babies buried in a Catholic Nun’s septic tank were dismembered, decapitated and in bits and pieces – signs that they could have been murdered in Satanic child sacrifice rites. In the last two months the ICLCJ Court has heard these heart-wrenching testimonies about the rape, torture and murder of children as recently as 2010 by Catholic leaders, European royal family members and other global elites. Murder sites of the Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult were said to be in the catacombs of Catholic Cathedrals including the Vatican and on private estates, military establishments and groves in Belgium, Holland, Spain, Australia, France, England and the US.</p>
<p>The ICLCJ Court has been overwhelmed with newly discovered evidence and a number of new witnesses coming forward to testify about Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult activities. They have uncovered Ninth Circle Satanic Cult member possible involvement in international child sacrifice, kidnapping, exploitation and drug rings. The five international judges and 27 jury members were expected to remain in session for at least a year due to the complexity of the cases.</p>
<p>Amnesty has been offered to citizens or employees of the Vatican, Crown of England, churches or governments willing to give sworn testimony or evidence that leads to the prosecution of these global elites suspected of committing crimes. Rewards up to 10,000 euros or around 13,660 dollars was available through the ICLCJ court.</p>
<p>The ICLCJ Court had over 450 Common Law Peace Officers in 13 countries, with 51 local chartered groups operating. Local organizing funds were available for common law groups that applied through the <a title="International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State" href="http://itccs.org/" target="_blank">International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State</a>.

<p>Are you a person, who repeats the Pledge of Allegiance at a local town board meeting or sings the National Anthem at a sporting event? Well, such people are likely candidates to turn over their firearms, when the collection van stops at your door to remove hazardous guns that endanger you, your family and neighbors. Surely, you file income taxes and pay your financial obligations to the government, what would prevent you from surrendering your personal lethal weapons, for the betterment of the state and the best interests of your community? Let’s get real! Any country that demands the capitulation of the right for self-protection does not deserve a citizen’s loyalty or obedience.</p>
<p><a href="http://batr.org/gulag/072912.html">Guns, Guts and Goons</a> looks at the proposed UN Treaty to ban guns. &#8220;The clock is running down and the American public needs to suck up the guts and nerve to oppose such a blatant assault on the natural rights of individuals, and resist repression from an international cabal of globalists&#8221;, but the implementation of the grand strategy comes from within the numerous layers of your own government.</p>
<p>Following the broad footsteps of <a href="http://www.loc.gov/law/help/firearms-control/australia.php">Firearms-Control Legislation and Policy: Australia</a>, the Obama administration is hell bent on disarming Americans. In a <a href="http://static.infowars.com/2013/02/i/general/nij-gun-policy-memo.pdf">Summary of Select Firearm Violence Prevention Strategies</a>, The 1997 Australia gun buyback and its associated regulations is cited, concluding, &#8220;The Australia buyback appears to have had no effect on crime otherwise&#8221;, and eliminates evidence that stripping gun ownership has any impact on reducing violent crime.</p>
<blockquote><p>1. It was large, buying back 20% of the firearm stock.</p>
<p>2. It targeted semi-automatic weapons.</p>
<p>3. It coupled the buyback with a ban on certain weapons and a nationwide registration and licensing program.</p></blockquote>
<p>This pattern of further restrictions on ammunition, clips and capacity is a back door approach to the data collection policy for national registration. The ultimate and final implication is total gun confiscation.</p>

<p>When Charles C. W. Cooke writes in the National Review, and references a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-8i92ClSzc&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a> where <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/380033/obama-praises-australias-gun-confiscation-charles-c-w-cooke">Obama Praises Australia’s Gun Confiscation</a>, his words are to the point.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Let me be clear, as Obama likes to say: You simply cannot praise Australia’s gun-laws without praising the country’s mass confiscation program. That is Australia’s law. When the Left says that we should respond to shootings as Australia did, they don’t mean that we should institute background checks on private sales; they mean that they we should ban and confiscate guns. No amount of wooly words can change this. Again, one doesn’t bring up countries that have confiscated firearms as a shining example unless one wishes to push the conversation toward confiscation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in the jurisdiction of the Metropolis state of <a href="http://www.batr.org/totalitariancollectivism/">totalitarian collectivist</a> empire builders, New York; the likes of Governor Cuomo and former NYC mayor Michael Bloomberg and the current el presidente, Bill de Blasio wage their commissar war against natural rights. Their goal is to enforce coercive governance upon a defenseless populace society, which is at the mercy of the real criminals; namely, the politicians, banksters, and corporatist criminals. Driving out of business gun manufactures is the eventual result of the <a href="http://www.batr.org/negotium/030613.html">Economics of Gun Control</a>, while the autocratic elites enjoy the protection of State Police Troopers and private bodyguard mercenaries.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The operational economics of gun control legislation has the purpose of maintaining a state controlled monopoly for firearms. One such example seen in the bill, known as the <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2013/02/23/more-gun-companies-not-selling-to-law-enforcement-in-anti-2nd-amendment-states/">NY SAFE Act</a>, included is a ban on any semi-automatic rifles or shotguns with &#8220;military-style&#8221; features, such as a pistol grip or a folding stock, has the goal of disarming the public. Such draconian methods drive the trade in guns underground. The black market in arms becomes the defiant mart for the new criminalization of self-protection seeking citizens.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The leaked <a href="http://www.infowars.com/leaked-counter-terrorism-bulletin-warns-police-of-impending-far-right-violence/">New York State Counter Terrorism Bulletin</a> would have you believe that &#8220;the &#8220;far right,&#8221; repeating the meme that those within the liberty movement are more dangerous than Al Qaeda.&#8221; How long will it be before any gun owner becomes part of this extremist list?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphbenko/2013/03/11/1-6-billion-rounds-of-ammo-for-homeland-security-its-time-for-a-national-conversation/" target="_self"><img src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/gun-confiscation.jpg.w300h196.jpg" alt="gun-confiscation.jpg" width="300" align="Right" /></a></p>
<p>When the chief crook within the Department of Injustice, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/380011/obamas-enforcer-john-fund-hans-von-spakovsky">Obama’s enforcer</a> Eric Holder speaks, <a href="http://freebeacon.com/issues/holder-we-want-to-explore-gun-tracking-bracelets/">We Want to Explore Gun Tracking Bracelets</a>, he is preparing the population to accept that the Second Amendment is so arbitrary and conditional to the whims of the governing tyrants, who will oversee that only designated loyal subjects have the legal ability to personal self-protection.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By making them either through finger print identification, the gun talks to a bracelet or something that you might wear, how guns can be used only by the person who is lawfully in possession of the weapon.</p>
<p>It’s those kinds of things that I think we want to try to explore so that we can make sure that people have the ability to enjoy their Second Amendment rights, but at the same time decreasing the misuse of weapons that lead to the kinds of things that we see on a daily basis.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are required to have a chip in a gun to fire, the next step is to place an authorization microchip implant into you body to pull the trigger.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.conservative-daily.com/2014/02/15/second-amendment-last-line-of-defense-against-tyranny/">Second Amendment: Last Line of Defense Against Tyranny</a>, states, &#8220;The right to keep and bear arms is a doomsday provision to be used as a last resort when all other rights fail. The founders saw firearm ownership as so necessary that they enumerated this right second in the Bill of Rights, immediately after defining the right to free speech.&#8221; What is so hard to understand about this unambiguous declaration of both<a href="http://www.earlyamerica.com/earlyamerica/milestones/commonsense/">common sense</a> and <a href="http://batr.org/autonomy/022205.html">natural law</a>?</p>
<p>There is no doubt, where Thomas Paine stood on the <a href="http://www.constitution.org/tp/rightsman1.htm">Rights of Man</a>. Paine, best remembered as a professional radical and a revolutionary propagandist without peer, is as relevant today as he was when he wrote his clarion call. Imagine what <a href="http://cnsnews.com/blog/gregory-gwyn-williams-jr/author-quotes-then-professor-obama-saying-i-dont-believe-people-should">Professor Barack Obama</a> says about guns and how 18th century would react to this foreign-born Tory.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In 1996, Obama supported a ban on handguns</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In 1998, he supported a ban on the sale of all semi-automatic guns</li>
<li>In 2004, he advocated banning gun sales within five miles of a school or park, which would have shut down nearly all gun stores</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://batr.org/reactionary/">Radical Reactionaries</a> are by nature revolutionaries. Nonetheless, revolt against a government that has lost illegitimacy does not require arm insurrection. The notion that an armed American citizenry will take on a full-fledged firefight against officials and authorities is a red herring. The purpose of a militant public is to cause doubt in the minds of the armed forces intended to deploy against their own people. A total stand down of militarized martial law enforcers is how to win the Second American Revolution.The revolt against the Crown is no different from the rebellion against the substitute replacement that now reigns under <a href="http://www.barefootsworld.net/admiralty.html">admiralty law</a> from the District of Criminals. The <a href="http://www.batr.org/totalitariancollectivism/081510.html">Barry Soetoro</a> presidency is just the latest escalation of imperial rule out of an establishment system that has totally dismissed constitutional restraints.</p>

Soon the cultural criminalization of gun owners will become a tenant of the newfound and official Pledge of Allegiance to the Empire.Even if avoiding that iron fist knock at the door, the incremental erosions in a society, that defends personal defense, is the most effective munitions used by the authoritarian despots. Slowly and surely, the false flag operations used to frighten gullible and insecure dupes has the intent of moving the collective psyche into a permanently induced state of voluntary subjugation.</p>
<p><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/06/28/controversy-would-you-take-away-guns-from-law-abiding-citizens/">The Daily Caller</a> features the question posed in <a href="http://americancopmagazine.com/will-you-do-it/">American COP</a>, Would You Take Away Guns From Law-Abiding Citizens? Within this response, the sick mentality of the Eric Holder, <a href="http://batr.org/view/062412.html">Fast and Furious</a>, Justice Department administration, meets the twisted minds of the law enforcement goons who are unable or unwilling to distinguish between Peace Keeping from &#8220;just following orders&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’ve known anti-gun cops, who seriously said things like, &#8220;They have no right to own a gun, it’s my job to protect them. If they have guns, it’s just a danger to me!&#8221; You might know someone like that too. And certainly, there are politicians out there who think the same way; and those very politicians often appoint police chiefs. Since sheriffs are elected, they can serve as a bit of a buffer on this topic.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Here lies the best barrier for lawful protection, the locally elected county sheriff. In spite of this, hope, the magnitude of the designed and deliberate assault on American Patriots, Tea Party and Truth Movements, readies the preparation for intentional and fabricated civil unrest. Depending on the response of active military and especially the leadership from the relics of a vigilant officer corps, the fate of the fallen Republic rests.</p>
<p>The answer to question, Will You Surrender Your Firearms, should be an emphatic, NO. The <a href="http://batr.org/view/081212.html">Chicago Gangster &#8211; Obama the Tyrant</a> article, demonstrates why the Obama regime is an existential danger for all rational and truehearted Americans. Restoring a meaningful future requires resistance against a despotic government. If citizens acquiesce to unconstitutional rule, having a gun will not defeat the traitors. The will to resist all government treason is the first step to prevent national oblivion.</p>

<p>In the last few months, 47,000 refugee children stormed America’s southern border.    They arrived from Central and South America.  The usual onslaught from Mexico’s overburdened population continued by the thousands.</p>
<p>In excess of 15 million undocumented Mexican border crossers now call America home.  They feed off America’s welfare systems from housing, food, educational and medical care.  They cost taxpayers in excess of $346 billion annually across 15 federal agencies.</p>
<p>Bush, Clinton, Bush II and Obama stopped enforcing our borders 30 years ago.  The word spread like a California wildfire.</p>
<p>Journalist Tom Ashbrook reported:  “The numbers of children surging over the southern US border now – unaccompanied, as young as six – is just staggering.  Forty thousand-plus.  Up 90 percent.  Still growing, flooding in.  Coming up from Central America, Mexico. Coming a thousand miles and more from Honduras.  Scared north by vicious gangs.   And now, piling up in US facilities not designed for an influx of kids.”</p>
<p>The third world uses America, Canada, Europe and Australia for a human “escape valve.”  Since the third world adds 80 million desperate children annually to already staggering populations in China, India, Bangladesh, Mexico, Indochina and most of Africa—Western countries face shocking migration numbers that will collapse civilizations.</p>
<p>Because of relentless, enormous and endless legal and illegal immigration, America faces an added 300,000,000 (million) more people within this century.</p>
<p>Ironically, Diane Sawyer, Brian Williams, Shepard Smith, Scott Pelley and Wolf Blitzer benignly report the invasion of our country—but they refuse to interview anyone who speaks about the end result of adding 300,000,000 people to America.</p>
<p>This is what it will look like:</p>
<p>“Immigration by the numbers—off the chart” by Roy Beck  <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.numbersusa.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNED3jeb_DBz-VHzIJCZ6AVxEEUXKg">www.NumbersUSA.org</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muw22wTePqQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muw22wTePqQ</a></p>
<p>If every American saw this video, they would scream at Congress and Obama to effectively close down mass migration into America.</p>
<p>Instead, powerful forces like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Speaker of the House John Boehner and corporations clamor for more immigration in the face of 48 million Americans subsisting on food stamps and tens of millions living off taxpayers with Section 8 housing.</p>
<p>“Late last week, the Obama administration asked Congress for $1.4 billion in extra funding to help house, feed and transport the tens of thousands of children being caught trying to cross the border illegally, and turned to the Defense Department to help temporarily house more than 1,000 of the children,” said Chris Sherman, DC journalist.</p>
<p>Every dollar paid out to care for endless legal and illegal immigration must be borrowed from foreign nations.  Our country stands a mind-numbing $18 trillion in debt.</p>
<p>As a country, as a civilization, as a people, we cannot continue on this path of accepting the world’s endless refugee line.  If we continue, we face ultimate collapse ourselves.  It’s that simple.</p>
<p>Our citizens chose 2.0 children per female since 1970, but the world eschewed birth control to continue adding 80 million annually, net gain.  Now, because of mass starvation of 10,000,000 (million children) annually, they cannot and we cannot solve the overload.</p>
<p>As a world traveler, I can tell you that the line never ends; it only grows exponentially.  Humanity faces hard choices in the 21<sup>st</sup> century that it continues to avoid, ignore and evade. But not much longer.</p>
<p>“It is abundantly clear that the reason for the uptick …has to do with what’s going on in Central American countries,” said an administration official on the conference call. “The federal government prepared for this trend,” an official said, “but it was larger than we had anticipated.”</p>
<p>As we continue accepting millions as the “human population escape valve” of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the third world, driven by the Catholic Church, Islamic Church and other ancient religions refuse to advocate for birth control—continues exponentially.</p>
<p>This humanitarian crisis cannot and will not end well for Americans or the migrants.</p>
<p>What needs to be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distribute birth control to third world countries.</li>
<li>Focus on the Catholic and Islamic churches to come to terms with human overpopulation in the 21<sup>st</sup> century worldwide; demand they come to terms with the 21<sup>st</sup> century and advocate for birth control.</li>
<li>Guard America’s borders to allow no one to breach our country by using our military. Force those countries to deal with their own human overload. Stop encouraging endless immigration.</li>
<li>Reduce all legal immigration into the United States to less than 100,000 annually instead of the current 100,000 every 30 days.</li>
<li>Promote a world conference on human overpopulation and all nations’ stake in providing birth control throughout the human family.</li>
<li>Interview top experts who scientifically show the end result if we fail to take destiny into our own hands.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is that destiny?</p>
<p><em>If we don’t halt population growth with justice and compassion, it will be done for us by nature, brutally and without pity – and will leave a ravaged world.  ~Nobel Laureate Dr. Henry W. Kendall</em></p>
<p>&#8220;The raging monster upon the land is population growth. In its presence, sustainability is but a fragile theoretical construct.  To say, as many do, that the difficulties of nations are not due to people, but to poor ideology and land-use management is sophistic.”  Harvard scholar and biologist E.O. Wilson</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Unlimited population growth cannot be sustained; you cannot sustain growth in the rates of consumption of resources. No species can overrun the carrying capacity of a finite land mass. This Law cannot be repealed and is not negotiable.</em>” Dr. Albert Bartlett, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.albartlett.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrlyg0Lt6yiM2OonnDZQclMzFlug">www.albartlett.org</a> , University of Colorado, USA.</p>
<p><em>“Most Western elites continue urging the wealthy West not to stem the migrant tide [that adds 80 million net gain annually to the planet], but to absorb our global brothers and sisters until their horrid ordeal has been endured and shared by all—ten billion humans packed onto an ecologically devastated planet.” Dr. Otis Graham, Unguarded Gates</em></p>

<p>The Ukraine crisis has its roots in a policy that dates back nearly 20 years. The origins of the policy can be traced to a 1997 article in Foreign Policy magazine by Zbigniew Brzezinski, titled “A Geostrategy for Eurasia.” The article makes the case that the United States needs to forcefully establish itself in Central Asia in order to maintain its position as the world’s only superpower. While many readers may be familiar with Brzezinski’s thinking on these matters, they might not know what he has to say about Russia, which is particularly illuminating given that the recent uptick in violence has less to do with Ukraine than it does with Washington’s proxy-war on Russia. Here’s what Brzezinski says:</p>
<p>“Russia’s longer-term role in Eurasia will depend largely on its self-definition…Russia’s first priority should be to modernize itself rather than to engage in a futile effort to regain its status as a global power. Given the country’s size and diversity, a decentralized political system and free-market economics would be most likely to unleash the creative potential of the Russian people and Russia’s vast natural resources. A loosely confederated Russia — composed of a European Russia, a Siberian Republic, and a Far Eastern Republic — would also find it easier to cultivate closer economic relations with its neighbors. Each of the confederated entitles would be able to tap its local creative potential, stifled for centuries by Moscow’s heavy bureaucratic hand. In turn, a decentralized Russia would be less susceptible to imperial mobilization.” Zbigniew Brzezinski, <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article6266.htm">A Geostrategy for Eurasia</a>, Foreign Affairs, 76:5, September/October 1997.</p>
<p>So is this the goal of US policy, to create “A loosely confederated Russia” whose economy can be subsumed into America’s market-based system?</p>
<p>Notice how easily Brzezinski chops Russia into smaller, bite-size statelets that pose no threat to US imperial expansion. Brzezinski undoubtedly envisions a Russia that will sell its vast resources in petrodollars and recycle them into US Treasuries further enriching the corrupt rent-skimmers in Washington and Wall Street. He foresees a Russia that will abdicate its historic role in the world and have no say-so in shaping global policy. He imagines a compliant Russia that will help facilitate US imperial ambitions in Asia, even to the point where it will pay to police its own people on behalf of US oligarchs, weapons manufacturers, oil magnates, and 1 percenters. Here’s the paragraph in Brzezinski’s piece that sums up Washington’s objectives in Ukraine, Russia and beyond. It is fittingly headlined with the following words in bold print:</p>
<p><strong>TRANSCONTINENTAL SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>“Defining the substance and institutionalizing the form of a trans-Eurasian security system could become the major architectural initiative of the next century. The core of the new transcontinental security framework could be a standing committee composed of the major Eurasian powers, with America, Europe, China, Japan, a confederated Russia, and India collectively addressing critical issues for Eurasia’s stability. The emergence of such a transcontinental system could gradually relieve America of some of its burdens, while perpetuating beyond a generation its decisive role as Eurasia’s arbitrator. Geostrategic success in that venture would be a fitting legacy to America’s role as the first and only global superpower.” Zbigniew Brzezinski, “A Geostrategy for Eurasia,” Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Translation: The United States will police the world, dispatch troublemakers, and eliminate potential threats wherever it finds them. It will impose its neoliberal dogma (Austerity, privatization, structural adjustment, anti labor reforms, etc) across-the-board and on all participants. Also, minor partners–”Europe, China, Japan, a confederated Russia, and India”–will be expected to provide security for their own people at their own expense in order to “relieve America of some of its burdens.”</p>
<p>Nice, eh? So you even have to pay for your own jailers.</p>
<p>And what is “Transcontinental Security” anyway? Isn’t it just a fancy way of saying “one world government”?</p>
<p>Indeed, it is. It’s the very same thing. Here’s more from Brzezinski:</p>
<p>“Failure to widen NATO…would shatter the concept of an expanding Europe… Worse, it could reignite dormant Russian political aspirations in Central Europe.”</p>
<p>This is an oddly convoluted statement. In the first sentence, Brzezinski supports the idea of an “expanding Europe”, and then in the next breath, he worries that Russia might want to do the same thing. It’s another case of the pot calling the kettle black.</p>
<p>What’s clear, is that –in Brzezinski’s mind– EU and NATO expansion will help Washington achieve its hegemonic aspirations. That’s all that matters. Here’s what he says:</p>
<p>“Europe is America’s essential geopolitical bridgehead in Eurasia…A wider Europe and an enlarged NATO will serve the short-term and longer-term interests of U.S. policy… A politically defined Europe is also essential to Russia’s assimilation into a system of global cooperation.”</p>
<p>“Bridgehead”? In other words, Europe is just a means to an end. But what would that “end” be?</p>
<p>Global domination. Isn’t that what he’s talking about?</p>
<p>Of course, it is.</p>
<p>What makes the Ukrainian crisis so hard to understand, is that the media conceals the policy behind the impenetrable fog of daily events. Once the fog lifts though, it’s easy to see who’s causing all the trouble. It’s the party that’s calling the shots from abroad, the good old US of A.</p>
<p>Putin doesn’t want this war and neither do most Ukrainians. The whole thing was conjured up by Uncle Sam and his minions to stop the flow of Russian gas to Europe, to push NATO further eastward, and to break the Russian Federation into little pieces. That’s what it’s really all about. And these madmen are willing to raze Ukraine to the ground and kill every living organism within a 3,000 mile radius of Kiev to get their way. After all, isn’t that what they did in Iraq? They sure did. And did I mention that, according to this week’s Wall Street Journal, “Iraq’s Oil Output Surged to Highest Level in Over 30 Years” with all the usual suspects raking in hefty profits.</p>
<p>The point is, if they’d did it in Iraq, they’ll do it in Ukraine too. Because what Washington cares about is constituents not carnage. Carnage they can handle.</p>
<p>Brzezinski is not the only one supporting the current policy either. There’s also fellow traveler, Hillary Clinton. In fact, it was Secretary of State Clinton who first used the term “pivot” in a 2011 article in Foreign Policy Magazine titled “America’s Pacific Century”. Clinton’s op-ed described a “rebalancing” plan that would open up new markets to US corporations and Wall Street, control the flow of vital resources, and “forge a broad-based military presence” across the continent. Here’s an excerpt from the text of Clinton’s seminal speech:</p>
<p>“The future of politics will be decided in Asia, not Afghanistan or Iraq, and the United States will be right at the center of the action.</p>
<p>As the war in Iraq winds down and America begins to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan, the United States stands at a pivot point. Over the last 10 years, we have allocated immense resources to those two theaters. In the next 10 years, we need to be smart and systematic about where we invest time and energy, so that we put ourselves in the best position to sustain our leadership, secure our interests, and advance our values. One of the most important tasks of American statecraft over the next decade will therefore be to lock in a substantially increased investment — diplomatic, economic, strategic, and otherwise — in the Asia-Pacific region…</p>
<p>Harnessing Asia’s growth and dynamism is central to American economic and strategic interests and a key priority for President Obama. Open markets in Asia provide the United States with unprecedented opportunities for investment, trade, and access to cutting-edge technology…..American firms (need) to tap into the vast and growing consumer base of Asia…The region already generates more than half of global output and nearly half of global trade. As we strive to meet President Obama’s goal of doubling exports by 2015, we are looking for opportunities to do even more business in Asia…</p>
<p>…as I talk with business leaders across our own nation, I hear how important it is for the United States to expand our exports and our investment opportunities in Asia’s dynamic markets.” (“America’s Pacific Century”, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton”, Foreign Policy Magazine, 2011)</p>
<p>“Harnessing Asia’s growth and dynamism is central to American economic and strategic interests and a key priority for President Obama”?</p>
<p>Does that sound like someone who wants to cultivate a mutually-beneficial relationship with their trading partners or someone who wants to move in, take over and run the show?</p>
<p>Washington’s plan to shift its attention from the Middle East to Asia is all about money. Clinton even says so herself. She says, “The region generates more than half of global output and nearly half of global trade…Asia’s markets … provide the United States with unprecedented opportunities for investment, trade, and…a vast and growing consumer base.”</p>
<p>Money, money, money. The upside-profit potential is limitless which is why Madame Clinton wants to plant Old Glory right in “the center of the action”, so US corporations can rake in the dough without fear of reprisal.</p>
<p>Brzezinski says the same thing in his magnum opus “The Grand Chessboard” Here’s an excerpt:</p>
<p>“A power that dominates Eurasia would control two of the world’s three most advanced and economically productive regions. A mere glance at the map also suggests that control over Eurasia would almost automatically entail Africa’s subordination, rendering the Western Hemisphere and Oceania (Australia) geopolitically peripheral to the world’s central continent. About 75 per cent of the world’s people live in Eurasia, and most of the world’s physical wealth is there as well, both in its enterprises and underneath its soil. Eurasia accounts for about three-fourths of the world’s known energy resources.” (Zbigniew Brzezinski, “The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy And It’s Geostrategic Imperatives”, page 31)</p>
<p>Get the picture? It’s a gold rush! Having successfully looted every last farthing from the battered US middle class and left the economy in a ghastly shambles, Brzezinski, Clinton and Co. are headed for greener pastures in Central Asia, home of the world’s largest oil producing nation, boundless reserves in the Caspian Basin, and zillions of voracious consumers who’ll need everything from I Pads to leisure wear, all graciously provided by US-owned corporations. Cha-ching!</p>
<p>So don’t get tripped up on the daily events in Ukraine. This isn’t a clash between pro-government forces and anti-government activists. This is the next big phase of Washington’s plan to conquer the world, a plan that will inevitably pit Moscow against the amassed military power of the United States of America. This is David vs. Goliath, Mother Russia vs. the Great Satan, Vladie Putin vs. Comrade Wolf.</p>
<p>Ukraine is just Round 1.</p>

<p>Quite a stir occurred with the academic presentation, <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/515926/how-technology-is-destroying-jobs/">How Technology Is Destroying Jobs</a>, by Brynjolfsson, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, and his collaborator and coauthor Andrew McAfee. Both &#8220;have been arguing for the last year and a half that impressive advances in computer technology—from improved industrial robotics to automated translation services—are largely behind the sluggish employment growth of the last 10 to 15 years. Even more ominous for workers, the MIT academics foresee dismal prospects for many types of jobs as these powerful new technologies are increasingly adopted not only in manufacturing, clerical, and retail work but in professions such as law, financial services, education, and medicine.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Perhaps the most damning piece of evidence, according to Brynjolfsson, is a chart that only an economist could love. In economics, productivity—the amount of economic value created for a given unit of input, such as an hour of labor—is a crucial indicator of growth and wealth creation. It is a measure of progress. On the chart Brynjolfsson likes to show, separate lines represent productivity and total employment in the United States. For years after World War II, the two lines closely tracked each other, with increases in jobs corresponding to increases in productivity. The pattern is clear: as businesses generated more value from their workers, the country as a whole became richer, which fueled more economic activity and created even more jobs. Then, beginning in 2000, the lines diverge; productivity continues to rise robustly, but employment suddenly wilts. By 2011, a significant gap appears between the two lines, showing economic growth with no parallel increase in job creation. Brynjolfsson and McAfee call it the &#8220;great decoupling.&#8221; And Brynjolfsson says he is confident that technology is behind both the healthy growth in productivity and the weak growth in jobs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Building upon this study, MSM provides a three part series on, <a href="http://news.msn.com/us/loss-of-middle-class-jobs-compounded-by-tech-advances">Loss of middle-class jobs compounded by tech advances</a>. The following admission by the technological behemoth should give pause for future generations.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Most of the jobs will never return, and millions more are likely to vanish as well, say experts who study the labor market. What&#8217;s more, these jobs aren&#8217;t just being lost to China and other developing countries, and they aren&#8217;t just factory work. Increasingly, jobs are disappearing in the service sector, home to two-thirds of all workers.</p>
<p>The global economy is being reshaped by machines that generate and analyze vast amounts of data; by devices such as smartphones and tablet computers that let people work just about anywhere, even when they&#8217;re on the move; by smarter, nimbler robots; and by services that let businesses rent computing power when they need it, instead of installing expensive equipment and hiring IT staffs to run it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This reality is all around us, but the full impact yet appreciated, is that the cloud of computing is not increasing business employment for the main street economy. For more bad news look at the results from the Associated Press analysis of employment data from 20 countries in, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/smart-machines-job-article-1.1246522">Can smart machines take your job? Middle class jobs increasingly being replaced by technology</a>, which found that &#8220;almost all the jobs disappearing are in industries that pay middle-class wages, ranging from $38,000 to $68,000. Jobs that form the backbone of the middle class in developed countries in Europe, North America and Asia.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the United States, half of the 7.5 million jobs lost during the Great Recession paid middle-class wages, and the numbers are even more grim in the 17 European countries that use the euro as their currency. A total of 7.6 million midpay jobs disappeared in those countries from January 2008 through last June.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The article then goes on to cite that more information now crosses the Internet every second than the entire Internet stored 20 years ago. Other examples note that:</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto announced plans last year to invest $518 million in the world&#8217;s first long-haul, heavy-duty driverless train system at its Pilbara iron ore mines in Western Australia.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dirk Vander Kooij&#8217;s furniture-making company in the Netherlands needs only a skeleton crew — four people. The hard work at the Eindhoven-based company is carried out by an old industrial robot that Vander Kooij fashioned into a 3D printer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Soon to come are pilotless airliners joining the several Japanese rail lines already run by themselves. Add the smart utility meter deployment and soon the employee reader, banished to a wax museum, becomes just another sign of &#8220;so called&#8221; progress.</p>
<p>Missing in all this corporate excitement for slashing payroll is the indisputable fact that the general standard of living is dropping like a rock for the average family. Couple this deadly trend with the unnerving prospects forecasted by Bob Lord in, <a href="http://inequality.org/trillionaire-matter-time/">Our First Trillionaire: Only a Matter of Time</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The unavoidable result: Wealth at the top is growing at a faster rate than aggregate wealth. That’s where the arithmetic comes in to play. If the wealth of one group within a nation grows at a faster rate than the nation’s aggregate wealth, that group’s share of the aggregate wealth must increase over time. That’s a mathematical certainty. And the level of subsequent wealth concentration has no limit.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Technological development coupled with favorable political treatment is regularly the formula for massive accumulation of fortune. However, the horrendous social distortions that inexorably follows such distortions in income, much less the fact that the disappearance in living wage employment of the masses cannot be ignored without fundamental political upheaval.</p>
<p>Once innovated technology of a Henry Ford raised the living standards and was a benefit for society. Today’s objective is to remove or eliminate the middle class as the gap in meaningful employment widens. Added leisure time has no significance if spent on playing games on an IPAD, while living off welfare government programs.</p>
<p>Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s breakdown is a chilling look at a bleak future and the goodbye kiss to a populist beneficial economy.</p>

<p>“The introduction of genetically modified foods (GMO) tampers with the essence of life in an experiment with an unknown outcome and no real way to undue the damage. The FDA purposely does not require labeling of GMO food, since no one who understands the issue would ever purchase it. This makes it all the more difficult to locate healthful food.”  Byron J. Richards, <em>The Leptin Diet: How Fit Is Your Fat?</em></p>
<p>This series exposes the outright fraud against peoples’ lives and the contempt for American citizens (and citizens of the world who eat our grains) with the injection of Genetically Modified Organism foods by the highest representatives in our U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>Call it a “financial cartel” that allows GMOs to be fed to our citizenry, but worse, for the love of money, those power elites accelerate the destruction of our Natural World.</p>
<p>We humans grow too clever and too arrogant to understand the long-term penalties we heap on Mother Nature until she finds no other answers but to claw back at us, i.e., cancers, disease and more aberrant environmental disasters to come.</p>
<p>Every crop in America, Canada, Australia and much of the third world where GMO advocates like ADM and Monsanto can force their “Frankensteinization” on farmers—they push it.</p>
<p>Even with all the evidence piling up, those same elites hammer any opposition into the ground.  They “bribe” the FDA officials to not label any GMO foods so you don’t know what you’re eating.</p>
<p>We destroy our own bodies by our actions, but we also obliterate the Natural World and its inhabitants.</p>
<p>Today around the world, trillions of bees suffer “colony collapse” via GMO crops.  Nature cannot figure out how to deal with plants that suffer genetic modification or DNA change-ups.</p>
<p>GMO foods represent a pitcher throwing an orange to the catcher in a Major League Baseball game.  Within several pitches, the orange wouldn’t hold its form from the violent treatment.  If the batter connected with the orange, it would splatter all over the field.  Result: the game couldn’t continue.  The players could not play and the spectators would go home.</p>
<p>But in GMO production, the consequences cannot be seen as quickly, however those “errors” against Mother Nature will surface well into the future.</p>
<p>Ethan Huff, science writer for Natural News said,  “A pair of studies recently published in the journal <em>Science</em> raises dire warnings about the continued decline of crop-pollinating insects all over the world, and what this means for the future of the world&#8217;s food supply. Both studies highlight the fact that wild pollinators like bumblebees, butterflies, and beetles are basically disappearing, and that industrial agriculture, which includes genetically-modified organisms (GMOs), are a major factor causing this insect genocide.</p>
<p>“At least half a dozen other studies published in the last couple of years have arrived at similarly disturbing findings. They do, however, shed further light on how the situation has progressed throughout the decades, pointing to corporate monoculture practices, shrinking forests and wild lands, and general changes in physical landscapes as some of the primary culprits in promoting this ruinous trend.”</p>
<p>We not only change the DNA of our fellow planetary travelers, but we destroy their habitat.  We seem to think no consequences will befall us.</p>
<p>“The earth does not belong to man, man belongs to the earth. All things are connected like the blood that unites us all. Man did not weave the web of life, he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself.”<br />
― <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fauthor%2Fshow%2F331799.Chief_Seattle&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEkuw30SIK0M1R2VC2pFk1kZcGNbw">Chief Seattle</a></p>
<p>Last week, I interviewed with Ross Kaminsky at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.KOA.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEz2i_chUh63_gvBb066sf_KFNXUw">www.KOA.com</a> in Denver, Colorado. Mind you, this young man, about 30, sounded brilliant and highly articulate.  I liked him.   I spoke about America adding 100 million immigrants and a total of 138 million people by 2050—a scant 36 years from now.  I brought facts and compelling information to the show.  I attempted to show him and the public the ramifications of adding 138 million people—and that, we could not sustain such numbers and our environment.</p>
<p>He sat across from me saying, “We don’t have a population problem. We have plenty of water and oil.  The oceans can absorb all our carbon footprint.”</p>
<p>I said, “You’re speaking with assumptions as if they were facts.  You make statements based on belief where I make them based on facts from my research.”</p>
<p>He dumbfounded me with his arrogance that we can keep adding endless people with no consequences. He wanted everyone to live a free life.  I countered with the fact that as our population numbers rise, our freedoms decline along with balance in our Natural World.  That fact cannot be disputed.</p>
<p>I explained how our oceans suffer acidification and that reefs die with carbon footprint and how marine life cannot endure the onslaught.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t hear of it.  Mind you, this young man, traveled on six continents like I have traveled.  He lives in denial and defends it. Along with him, the majority of the American public feels the same.</p>
<p>We see the same denial with our leaders who advocate for GMOs in plants and fish—in the face of facts.</p>
<p>“In one of the studies, researchers from <em>Montana State University</em> (MSU) compared insect data collected in the late 1800s to similar data collected in the same test location in the 1970s,” said Huff. “They then compiled current data from the same area to compare to both of these other two data sets, upon which they discovered that the number of unique wild bee species had dropped by nearly half.</p>
<p>“What is perhaps more disturbing, however, is the fact that researchers observed modern bees to be generally interacting less with plants than they used to in previous generations. According to the data, the overall number of interactions between bees and plants has also dropped by roughly half, indicating a serious problem as far as the general <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.naturalnews.com%2Ffood_supply.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4mPP83RjMBjk_230oZRJFYnflhA">food supply</a> is concerned, as about 75 percent of global food crops rely on pollination by animals.”</p>
<p><strong>Managed honeybees do not pollinate crops as well as wild honeybees</strong></p>
<p>The second study troubles me further:  having found that pollinating insects in general, which include a wide range of insects and other animals, continue vanishing from their normal habitats and foraging areas.</p>
<p>“Based on field trials conducted in 20 different countries, wild insects are clearly on the decline everywhere, and managed honeybee colonies established to replace them in many areas are failing to pick up where the wild honeybees left off,” said Huff.</p>
<p>&#8220;In landscapes with lower diversity and lower abundance of wild insects, the crops had less fruits,&#8221; explains Lucas Garibaldi, author of the second study. &#8220;Wild insects pollinated way more efficiently: Flowers produced twice as many fruits after being visited by wild insects and were more consistent in their production than when visited by honeybees.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Some “leaders” blame climate destabilization and other outside factors for this mysterious decline in crop <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.naturalnews.com%2Fpollinators.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG7QB9M6W9HC4ENdn_Etrj6rXCH5Q">pollinators</a>,” said Huff. “But the major elephant in the room, and the one that <strong>the mainstream media</strong> is desperately trying to avoid, <strong>is GMOs</strong> and the chemical-based technologies used to grow them. As we have covered time and time again, neonicotinoids and other pesticide and herbicide products are responsible for weakening and killing off bees and other crop pollinators, particularly in North America where <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.naturalnews.com%2FGMOs.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGJczbJwcmhfHBCICAjt77fXGwRqQ">GMOs</a> are most widely cultivated.”</p>
<p>&#8220;The proof is obvious that one of the major reasons of the bees&#8217; decline is by the ingestion of GMO proteins,&#8221; explains a report by Brit Amos from <em>Global Research</em> about the decline of bee colonies. &#8220;The truth is that organic farming is relatively untouched as the bee crisis is concerned. Organic farming maintains the diversity of the eco-system and preserves the quality of the foods produced.&#8221;</p>
<p>The more I research into what we and our children face with our “disfiguring” the Natural World with our poisons and GMO assault, the more sickened I am in my mind and heart.  Since I lack any power or influence, someone like Bill Gates or Warren Buffet needs to fund campaigns to stop GMO production.  After all, it’s their kids, too, who must live in this world.</p>
<p>All of this GMO nightmare stems from too many people needing food for survival with too many elites willing to sacrifice the Natural World in order to make endless billions of dollars to live in big homes, drive expensive cars and fly Lear Jets.<br />

<p>In &#8220;<em>The attack on biblical creation in UK schools continues</em>,&#8221; Phil Robinson reports that in the dechristianized U.K. unrelenting attacks against special creation (Genesis account) display a level of aggressive intolerance that is hard to stomach, coming as they do from self-proclaimed scientifically-enlightened ‘voices of reason.’  Some schools have already banned the teaching of special creation in favor of evolutionary science.   (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcreation.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFz2TTlNCM3Mti6nKV5HZ7qM-W5oQ">creation.com</a>, Mar. 9, 2014)</p>
<p>Other shrill &#8216;voices of reason&#8217; go so far as to connect special creation to mental illness and child abuse. During a radio interview in Australia famous physicist and atheist propagandist Lawrence Krauss said that while in the United States recently, he stated that &#8220;<em>teaching creationism is child abuse and I think it is.&#8221; </em>(Prayer News, a publication of Creation Ministries, Apr. 2014)</p>
<p>Throughout the West and here in America a slash-and-burn operation conducted against the Genesis account, particularly its&#8217; literal and historical elements, is justified by the false idea that evolution is science, thus intolerance of special creation is often presented as a ‘science versus religion’ or ‘faith versus reason’ issue.   So successful has this war of attrition been that younger generations of Westerners and Americans have been disconnected from both Western history and its’ founding Christian-based worldview, thus like seedlings recently popped up from the soil are unconcerned that special creation, where the ultimate source of life, being and unalienable rights are found, has nearly been displaced by anti-human pagan conceptions positing billions of years of evolutionary transformism from lower kinds of things to higher and higher kinds of things&#8212; even non-human kinds of things:</p>
<p><em>“For us, the best way to create new (‘artificial’) life forms and intelligence is to allow them to emerge through evolution, as nature does, only in much shorter timeframes and with much greater efficiency and variety.”</em></p>
<p><em><br />
“For conscious evolution to be successful, we need to observe and understand the actual workings of nature, in all its dynamism, to the point of profound reverence, or ‘worship.’ This is what I call extreme nature-worshipping… From the perspective of extreme nature-worshipping, the real significance of Darwin’s evolutionary theory is not that humans descended from lower species, but that we can continue to evolve.”</em>(Cosmic Beings: Transhumanist Deism in Ted Chu’s Cosmic View, Institute for Ethics &amp; Emerging Technology, Giulio Prisco)</p>
<p>The vicious name-calling, seething resentment toward and censorship of the six day creation account and of all who profess and teach it should raise the eyebrows of any rational thinking person.  If evolution really is a fact of science then why the irrational name-calling, ridicule, scorn, shunning, resentment, intolerance and demonization?</p>
<p>The answer is that the zealous worshipper of evolution is the Spirit of our age that emerged out of the Renaissance whose answer to the Lord Jesus Christ is the Cross (crucify Him) and whose fulfillment will be the Wicked One. (2 Thess. 2:1-8)</p>
<p>From the Renaissance to our own time the Spirit has been transgressing, blaspheming, and departing that it need not obey His voice.   Like a dog returning to its own vomit, the Spirit has returned to its first love: the cult of demons in the Godless universe of matter, psychic energy, and animated forces where time is changed, past history rendered meaningless, and the liberated Spirit imbibes the cup of wrath, an intoxicating mixture of Babylonian Mysteries, incantations, spiritism, Gnosticism, sorcery, witchcraft, Hermetic magic, Kabbalah, reincarnation, astrology, and other devilish occult traditions.</p>
<p>The Book of Revelation pinpoints Babylon as the post-flood center of an occult pagan Mystery religion based on advaitic monism, science of magic transformism, exalted priesthood, gnosis, secret initiations, psychic-powers, familiar spirits, androgyny, sexual perversions, and other evils.</p>
<p>Babylon embraced the Great Lie. Its inhabitants claimed the title, &#8220;I AM.&#8221; The root source of this evil religion and its occult power was the Great Dragon himself&#8230;.Lucifer:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;. <em>the Great Lie </em>(is) <em>the foundation stone of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, Jainism, Sikhism, Taoism, the Kabala, the Greek Hermetic, Eleusinian and Gnostic beliefs, Neo-Platonism, all the occult creeds from Theosophy and the Masonic orders to the Rosicrucian&#8217;s (and) the New Age movement. The Great Lie is&#8230;the belief that man is God, that his true identity is the immortal self&#8230;that as God, he will never die </em>(and) <em>Sin and depravity are&#8230;illusions since this inner divinity is at man&#8217;s core.&#8221;</em> (The Great Lie, Tal Brooke, SCP Journal, Vol. 29:2-29:3, 2005)</p>
<p>Though the Spirit of our age claims the title “I AM” it nevertheless follows after and falls down before other fascinating men: theoreticians of evolutionary science, nature philosophy and evolutionary pagan theology. These charismatic Pied Pipers are possessed of surpassing powers of persuasion and inflexible determination of will to which the Spirit assigns more honor than to anything else.</p>
<p>The Spirit has usurped the throne of the Word Incarnate (John 1:1) because He is not good, not just or benevolent but a devil, an evil Tyrant Who, with His infliction of suffering in this life and eternal punishment in the next must be deposed. (Psalm 2:2-3)</p>
<p>Blaming our Lord for their own sins the proud, self-righteous Spirit of rebellion, hypocrisy and negation says to Him, “…<em>you are not my father</em>.”  My father is the god of forces, therefore:<br />
<em><br />
&#8220;I am I, I come out of myself, and in choice and action I make myself.&#8221;</em> (Daniel Bell, quoted by Herbert Schlossberg in &#8220;Idols for Destruction,&#8221; p. 43)</p>
<p>In the final analysis, the Spirit of our age is the “<em>striving human will</em>” seeking desperately to launch itself,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;into minor godhood in an evolving cosmos through the mechanisms of directed spiritual evolution, spiritualized science and spirit contact</em>.&#8221; The &#8216;new&#8217; spirituality now presents itself as the <em>&#8220;rightful replacement for the Revealed Word </em>(and)<em> proclaims its spiritual liberation from the worldview that informs Christianity and its freedom from </em>(the)<em> personal and wholly other God.  But this new way of self-salvation</em> (is)<em> little more than the refurbishing of an ancient spiritual mistake</em>.&#8221;  (The Making of the New Spirituality: the Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition, James A. Herrick, p. 279)</p>
<p><strong>“As it was in the days of Noah…” </strong></p>
<p>The ominous signs of this age are obvious, said the English theologian G.H. Pember (1837-1910) in his book, &#8220;<em>The Antichrist Babylon and the Coming Kingdom</em>.&#8221;  Just as it was during the pre-flood generations, open intercourse with demons (spiritism) is now common throughout Christendom and even in Russia.   In France it is the national pastime.   The apostles of the powers of darkness are everywhere proclaiming their scientific and evolutionary theories demonstrating that the world created itself and had no need of a Creator (p. 60) while the miseries which have resulted from sin,</p>
<p>“&#8230;.<em>are blasphemously charged upon the Almighty, Who so loved the world as to give His son for it </em>(but is now)<em> impiously forbidden to curb and discipline the rebels who owe their existence to the breath of His mouth.  And when we see such men as John Stuart Mill </em>(and) <em>John Morley, the late Chief Secretary for Ireland&#8230;guiding their fellows to defiant insubordination, we can scarcely wonder that Bradlaugh&#8230;said, ‘This world might have been happy, had not the shadow of God fallen upon it.</em>” (pp. 35-36, 1888)</p>
<p><strong>Rise of Occult Evolutionary Science </strong></p>
<p>In the impeccably researched, &#8220;<em>The Making of the New Spirituality</em>,&#8221; James Herrick observes that the scientific tradition in Renaissance Europe developed around three basic approaches: the organic, the mechanical and the magical.   It was magical and/or occult science that provided the greatest impetus for scientific exploration. (p. 45)</p>
<p>C.S. Lewis underscores this point in “<em>The Abolition of Man</em>:”</p>
<p>“<em>You will even find people who write about the sixteenth century as if Magic were a medieval survival and Science the new thing that came in to sweep it away. Those who have studied the period know better. There was very little magic in the Middle Ages: the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are the high noon of magic. The serious magical endeavour and the serious scientific endeavour are twins: one was sickly and died, the other strong and throve. But they were twins. They were born of the same impulse. I allow that some (certainly not all) of the early scientists were actuated by a pure love of knowledge. But if we consider the temper of that age as a whole we can discern the impulse of which I speak.”</em></p>
<p>In &#8220;<em>God and the Knowledge of Reality</em>,&#8221; the Catholic philosopher and historian, Thomas Molnar (1921–2010), reveals the &#8216;temper of that age&#8217; as a spirit of rebellion against the Christian God, and this is why occult science and evolutionary thinking provided the greatest impetus. During the Renaissance, certain Christian theologians, mystics and scholars such as Emanuel Swedenborg had discovered Hermetic magic and occult Jewish Kabbalah texts which they studied and translated resulting in Hermetic Kabbalah. Then like Pico della Mirandola, they argued that occult hermetic science – the divine technology or Magic Way of reaching divine status and powers through ritual procedures (spiritual evolution) is the best proof of the divinity of Christ. In other words said Molnar,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;..by the time of the Renaissance the esoteric texts of the first centuries A.D. had acquired in scholarly and humanist circles an unparalleled prestige, confronting as equals the texts held sacred by the church. In Pico&#8217;s estimation, &#8216;nulla est scientia que nos magis certificet de divinitate Christ quam magia et Cabala&#8217; (there is no science that would prove for us Christ&#8217;s divinity better than magic and the Cabala.)&#8221; </em>(pp. 78-79)</p>
<p>Hermetic magic and Jewish Kabbalah are ancient Mystery Religion traditions, as affirmed by G. H. Pember in his classic work, &#8220;<em>Earth&#8217;s Earliest Ages.&#8221;   </em>Pember thoroughly examines the role of fallen angels in connection with the magic (occult transformism) they taught to pre-flood generations and compares them to the explosion of spiritism (open intercourse with evil spirits), astrology, the Mysteries and other occult traditions sweeping over Christendom.</p>
<p>Pember writes that the Mysteries are no longer veiled in mystery but boldly presented by the powerful occult brotherhood that emerged out of the Renaissance as the fruit of modern science, especially evolutionary philosophy, which the brotherhood assert was included in the instructions given,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em>to the initiates of the Hermetic, Orphic, Eleusinian, and Cabbalistic mysteries, and were familiar to Chaldean Magi, Egyptian Priests, Hindu Occultists, Essenes, Therapeutae Gnostics, and Theurgic Neo-Platonists</em>.&#8221; (Pember, pp.243-244)</p>
<p><strong>Hermetic Magic<br />
</strong><br />
Hermeticism is an ancient Egyptian secret magic tradition based on a set of fourteen books known</p>
<p>collectively as the Corpus Hermeticum attributed to a mysterious figure known as Hermes Trismegistus. Implied in Hermeticism is an evolutionary process of magical transformism (spiritual evolution) moving from one kind of lower thing to another kind of higher thing:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Human beings are themselves the product of a long spiritual evolutionary process that moves from &#8216;creeping things&#8217; to fish, mammals, birds and then people.  Humans can&#8212;through occult knowledge and extraordinary ability&#8212;continue this evolutionary process and become daemons, then gods, and finally planets or stars</em>.&#8221; (The Making of the New Spirituality: The Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition, James A. Herrick, p. 40)</p>
<p>With respect to Hermes identity, researchers of antiquity are divided.  Some believe Hermes was a mythical figure.  Others argue he was Ham or his son Cush.  The historian Samuel Shuckford argues that Hermes was Pathrusim, king of Thebais, the son of Mizraim, the son of Ham.   His Egyptian name was Tyoth or Thoth.  (The Sacred and Profane History of the World Connected, 1808)</p>
<p>In any case, it was Thoth-Hermes who instructed his brothers in the arts and science magic of alchemy or transmutation of a lower kind of thing into a higher kind of thing. For example, after a lengthy transformative process out of the eternally existing divine abyss (primordial matter), the self-created Sun-God Ra boasted that he “<em>came into being from primordial matter.”  </em>He made all the forms under which he<em> “appeared by means of the god-soul” </em>which he raised up out of Nu, primordial matter. (The Long War Against God, Dr. Henry Morris, p. 243)</p>
<p><strong>Occult Kabalah</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;The Kabalah is the key to the occult sciences; and the Gnostics were born of the Kabalists</em>.” (Occult Mason Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, p. 626)</p>
<p>Like its’ Hermetic counterpart, Kabala implies a process of evolutionary transformism:</p>
<p><em>“&#8230;the older Enoch book </em>(gives) <em>a fuller insight into the &#8220;Merkabah&#8221; and &#8220;Bereshit&#8221; lore of the ancients than the &#8220;Hekalot,&#8221; which present but fragments, while the central figure of the Cabala, Meṭaṭron-Enoch, is seen in ch. lxx.-lxxi. in a process of transformation</em>.” (Cabala, Jewish Encyclopedia)</p>
<p>According to Helena Blavatsky, one of the key architects of Luciferian New Age pantheism, Kabalah derived,</p>
<p>“&#8230;.<em> from the older secret doctrines concerning divine things and cosmogony, which were combined into a theology after the time of the captivity of the Jews in Babylon. All the works that fall under the esoteric category are termed Kabalistic.” </em>(Blavatsky, Theosophical Glossary, p. 168)</p>
<p>The godless cosmogony of Kabala teaches the gradual condensation or evolutionary progression of a primal substance into visible matter.  This is a fundamental,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em> doctrine of the Cabala </em>(and<em>) is the ancient Semitic conception of the ‘primal ocean,’ known to the Babylonians as ‘Apsu’ and called by the Gnostics βύθος =</em>  (Anz, ‘Die Frage nach dem Ursprung des Gnostizismus,’ p. 98).</p>
<p>The Chaldean occult science and pagan Mystery Religion was embraced by apostate Jews during their captivity in Babylon and delivered to subsequent generations of initiates by word of mouth. According to Blavatsky, these initiates of the Chaldean tradition in the centuries before Christ were known as Tanaim:<br />
<em>“The kabalist is a student of ‘secret science’, one who interprets the hidden meaning of the</em></p>
<p><em>Scriptures with the help of the symbolical Kabala… The Tanaim were the first kabalists among the Jews; they appeared at Jerusalem about the beginning of the third century before the Christian era… This secret doctrine is identical with the Persian wisdom, or ‘magic’</em>.” (Ibid. p.167)</p>
<p>The Essenes were also associated with the Kabala. The Jewish Encyclopedia describes the cabalistic practices of the Essenes, which were Judaized elements of Eastern mystical traditions:</p>
<p>“<em>So, too, were the Essenes familiar with the idea of the journey to heaven…and they were also masters of angelology. The practice of magic and incantation, the angelology and demonology, were borrowed from Babylonia, Persia, and Egypt; but these foreign elements were Judaized in the process, and took the form of the mystical adoration of the name of God and of speculations regarding the mysterious power of the Hebrew alphabet …, ‘the name of God creates and destroys worlds’, to become, finally, foundations of the philosophy of the ‘Sefer Yetzirah</em>.&#8221;  (Cabala, Jewish Encyclopedia)</p>
<p>According to Blavatsky the Essenes were pagan priests of the Greek goddess, Diana of Ephesus, where the Tanaim had established a college for instruction in the Chaldean mystery religion:</p>
<p>“<em>Essenes&#8230; had many Buddhistic ideas and practices; and it is noteworthy that the priests of the Great Mother at Ephesus, Diana-Bhavani with many breasts, were also denominated&#8230; It was at Ephesus where was the great College of the Essenes and all the lore the Tanaim had brought from the Chaldees&#8230; Essenes, believed in reincarnation</em>.” (Theosophical Glossary, pp. 113-14; The Secret Doctrine, Vol. II, p. 111n)</p>
<p>Eventually Alexandria, Egypt became the epicenter of cosmological and pagan religious ideas as well as the intellectual meeting point between Greek Mystery Religion/Hermetic magic initiates and nature sages and guardians of Kabala.  After the fall of Jerusalem, Alexandria was the center from which occult pagan Jews would disguise their mystery tradition in Christian terminology and attempt to penetrate the fledgling Church with heresy.</p>
<p>One of the primary tactics employed by Cabbalist pagan Jews for this purpose is the same one employed by their modern evolutionary Gnostic pagan counterparts.   It involves the reduction of the Genesis account, particularly the first three books, to allegory and myth, a ploy that eliminates the physical Adam from which all people descended and the sin that he transferred to the rest of the human race. This strikes directly at the heart of the Gospel: the need for the ‘last Adam’ to provide for us an escape from the wrath of God against sin incurred by the first Adam.  In this way, not only is the work of Christ on the cross rendered superfluous, meaning the heart of the faith is ripped out, but God is made responsible for sin and evil. (1 Peter 3:18-22; 1 John 2:22)</p>
<p>Long ago, the teachings of some of the early Church Fathers regarding the apostasy toward the end of the church age predicted the reappearance of this evil tactic. The fathers categorized it a Gnostic pagan heresy.</p>
<p>In <em>&#8220;Heresies 6.10&#8243;</em> Hippolytus writes that the Gnostic pagan Simon Magus feigned faith and allegorized much of Scripture, especially Genesis, to support his evolutionary Hermetic and Gnostic occult pantheist teachings.   Church Fathers Ireneaus, Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria reveal that Gnostic cult leader Marcion rejected the Old Testament, taught that the God of the Old Testament and his prophets are evil, made God the author of sin and removed all references that Christ was Creator (John 1:1)   (Ireneaus, &#8220;Against Heresies 1.26, 5.1,&#8221; Tertullian &#8220;Against Marcion 2.17,&#8221; Clement of Alexandria, &#8220;Against Heresies 4.29)</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Babylonian Mystery Religion is the mother of evolutionary Cabala, Gnosticism and all other occult pagan traditions:</p>
<p><em>“&#8230;.especially does Gnosticism testify to the antiquity of the Cabala. Of Chaldean origin&#8230; Gnosticism was Jewish in character long before it became Christian&#8230; Gnosticism—that is, the cabalistic ‘Hokmah’ (wisdom)—seems to have been the first attempt on the part of the Jewish sages to give the empirical mystic lore, with the help of Platonic and Pythagorean or Stoic ideas, a speculative turn; hence the danger of heresy…of which the systems of Philo, an adept in Cabala&#8230;show many pitfalls&#8230;Jewish gnosticism unquestionably antedates Christianity, for Biblical exegesis had already reached an age of five hundred years by the first century C.E.  Judaism had been in close contact with Babylonian-Persian ideas for at least that length of time, and for nearly as long a period with Hellenistic ideas. Magic, also, which,&#8230;was a not unimportant part of the doctrines and manifestations of gnosticism, largely occupied Jewish thinkers. There is, in general, no circle of ideas to which elements of gnosticism have been traced, and with which the Jews were not acquainted.”  </em>(Cabala, Jewish Encyclopedia)</p>
<p><strong>Building  the New Tower of Babylon</strong></p>
<p>In the essay,<em> “The Paganization of Biblical Studies</em>,” Dr. Peter Jones, director of truthxchange and adjunct professor of Westminster Seminary CA., writes that the books of the evolutionary Gnostic pagan Presbyterian heretic Lloyd Geering, Emeritus Professor of Religious Studies at Victoria University, are promoted by the most powerful element of the Spirit of our age—the international occult New Age Luciferian elite-pagans&#8212;as programmatic templates for the future utopian pagan community from the point of view of Christian apostasy and socialism undergirded by evolutionary pantheist orthodoxy.</p>
<p>According to Geering, the world&#8217;s future culture will be post-Christian, global, religiously pagan and evolutionary.  This agenda is remarkably similar to that of Teilhard de Chardins’ disciple, the ex-Roman Catholic Thomas Berry in his book, <em>&#8220;The Great Work</em>&#8221; which is also being implemented through texts of the UN&#8217;s global programs.</p>
<p>The rising New World Order will be post-Christian because evolution proves that human beings, as they evolved out of primordial matter, created language, then symbols, then religious explanations and God Himself.  Therefore tomorrow&#8217;s culture will be pluralistic, syncretistic, relativistic and poly-gendered because evolution integrates all scientific, cultural, religious, economic and human gender into one worldwide anthill thus when the global society emerges from the evolutionary process,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;…it will require humanity to develop a new consciousness and a new form of spirituality</em>&#8221; because <em>&#8220;the new story which has become basic to the global world begins with a new word or idea&#8230;evolution.” </em>(ibid, Jones)</p>
<p>Like its’ mother, Mystery Babylon, the scientifically-enlightened ‘new&#8217; global religion of evolutionary transformism is occult pantheist advaita monism, which means that as an ancient impersonal god-force is within the cosmos, earth, human beings, rats, weeds, tumble bugs, cancer and everything else then all things are essentially &#8216;one.&#8217;  Since the god-force is within all things it is within the demonically &#8216;illumined&#8217; consciousness of every spiritually evolved initiate and adept.</p>
<p>This being the case, by means of trance states, brain-altering drugs, transcendental meditation, visualization, channeling, Zen Buddhism, Kundalini yoga, tantra, and other occult ways, the initiate can channel the god-force within thereby becoming a little god who controls matter because he controls mind. The physical world then, is an illusion because reality is inside the divine mind of the god-man.</p>
<p>This way of thinking is captured by Orwell in his book, “<em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>” in which negation of the physical world is an integral part of the social and political philosophy of Big Brother and his despotic Party. At one stage in the book, Winston stumbles upon the shocking realization that in the end the Party would announce that two plus two made five because the logic of Big Brothers’ position required it since the existence of external reality was denied by his philosophy.  Thus when the Thought Police agent O’Brien tortures Winston for politically incorrect “wrong thought” he states,</p>
<p><em>“We control matter because we control the mind.  Reality is inside the skull.  You will learn by degrees, Winston.  There is nothing that we could not do.  Invisibility, levitation&#8212;anything.  I could float off this floor like a soap bubble if I wish to….You must get rid of these nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of Nature.  We make the laws of Nature.” </em>(Orwell, “The New Spirituality and its Hallmarks, Alan Morrison, SCP Journal, Vol. 30:4-31:1, 2007, p. 19)</p>
<p><strong>Evolving Toward Catastrophe</strong></p>
<p>In &#8220;<em>The Aquarian Conspiracy</em>,&#8221; a book that has been called &#8216;the New Age Bible,&#8217; Marilyn Ferguson (1938-2008) admits that the ‘new age’ evolutionary pantheism and occult technologies being employed throughout America were at one time the private domain of ancient initiates.   In fact, as Constance Cumbey reveals in her thoroughly researched book, <em>&#8220;The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow,&#8221;</em> many New Age historians claim their occult religion and techniques originated in Atlantis and afterward were preserved in the ancient land of Babylon,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;and surrounding Plains of Shinar and from there disseminated throughout the earth, including Taoist doctrines of China, Mayan-Aztec teachings of Mexico and Central/South America; Great Spirit teachings of the American Indians, Hindu/Buddhist teachings of Asia, etc.&#8221; </em>(pp. 250-251)</p>
<p>After the Flood, said Shuckford, while the faithful Noah remained in the East and established the worship of the true God, eighty years after the Flood his rebellious son Ham and his sons together with other family members departed and eventually settled in the plains of Shinar where they resolved to build a tower, a monument to their own pride, vanity, ambition and rebellion against God. (ibid, p.94)</p>
<p>It was Noah’s son Ham, according to ancient Church Father Clement, who  ‘preserved’ and revived the Mystery Religion of ‘Atlantis’ and its attendant evils:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Fallen angels taught men the use of magical incantations that would force demons to obey man. After the flood Ham the son of Noah&#8230;discovered this and taught it to his sons.  This became ingrained into the Egyptians, Persians, and Babylonians.  Ham died shortly after the fall of the Tower of Babel.  Nimrod, called Ninus by the Greeks, was handed this knowledge and by it caused men to go away from the worship of God and go into diverse and erratic superstitions and they began to be governed by the signs in the stars and motions of the planets</em>.&#8221; (Recognitions of Clement 4.26-29)</p>
<p>In his well-researched book, &#8220;<em>Ancient Post-Flood History</em>,&#8221; Ken Johnson, Th.D., reports that the sons of Ham persuaded the people to accept that the true God was merely an impersonal creative force within all of nature, making man the highest form of life/god.  Through the power of persuasion, Ham and his sons revived magical evolutionary transformism, pantheism and idolatry. (pp. 47-48)</p>
<p>Eventually Ham was deified and worshipped by later pagans as the gods Cronus and Jupiter:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Ham is represented by many writers as a very wicked, immodest, and profligate creature: Berosus (i) makes him a magician, and to be the same with Zoroast or Zoroastres, and speaks of him as the public corrupter of mankind; and says that he taught men to live as before the flood, to lie with mothers, sisters, daughters, males and brutes, and creatures of all sorts; and that he actually did so himself, and therefore was cast out by his father Janus, or Noah, and got the name of &#8220;Chem&#8221;, the infamous and immodest&#8230;&#8221; Upon seeing his father&#8217;s nakedness Ham,  &#8220;told his two brethren without; he went out of the tent after he had pleased himself with the sight&#8230; and in a wanton, ludicrous, and scoffing manner, related what he had seen: some of the Jewish Rabbins (k), as Jarchi relates, say that Canaan first saw it, and told his father of it; and some say (l), that he or Ham committed an unnatural crime with him; and others (m), that he castrated him; and hence, it is supposed, came the stories of Jupiter castrating his father Saturn, and Chronus his father Uranus.&#8221; </em>   Genesis 9:22 Gill&#8217;s Exposition</p>
<p>History did not begin after billions of years of evolution when primitive hominids swung down from the trees and discovered how to scratch crude symbols onto rocks.    Nor did it begin after the Flood.  At least 2,000 years of human existence preceded the Flood, meaning that when Noah and his family entered the ark they carried at least one hundred years of pre-flood memories, traditions, technology, and superior knowledge. Their world view was shaped by the historical Adam and Eve and the generations of their offspring.   Thus Noah and his family brought with them not only the knowledge of the personal God, Special Creation, fall of man, the Deluge, sacrifice to God for the propitiation of sin, the arts of weapon-making and warfare, knowledge of letters, symbols, math, architecture, science, cosmetics, and agriculture  but knowledge of  first-hand encounters with Watchers, their occult teachings, the Nephilim, and primeval pantheism tied to magic, spiritism, herbal abortifacients, human and animal sacrifice, drinking of blood, males marrying males and even beasts, and many other evils.</p>
<p>In affirmation, the eminent researcher of antiquity James Bailey said:</p>
<p>“…<em>human history can now be hesitantly traced back as an unbroken narrative to 4000 B.C….the picture emerging…is one of the Fall of Man in historic terms as well as his rise; it is a picture…more of degradation than of success; it is a picture of monotheism breaking down into polytheism and of the struggle to return to monotheism.  The establishment view of the history of religion gradually progressing from animism to polytheism </em>(then)<em> to monotheism is the reverse of facts</em>.” (“The God-Kings and the Titans: The New World Ascendancy in Ancient Times 1973, p. 296)</p>
<p>Four thousand years before Christ were the antediluvian generations and the Watchers in the post-flood world, making the billions of years of evolutionary transformism a fabulous fable.  It is neither ‘new’ (Ecclesiastes 1: 9-11) nor scientific except in the sense of pre-flood and post-flood occult science and attendant traditions revised and revamped for our own time, as Geering unhappily discovered.</p>
<p>Dr. Jones writes that Geering was surprised when he found out that the<em> ‘New Spirituality’ </em>has <em>&#8220;links with pre-monotheistic&#8230;nature religions,</em>&#8221; leading Jones to wryly comment that in an odd turn of events,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;.contemporary spiritual&#8217; evolution goes backwards!  Biblical theism disturbed evolutionary progress.  The clocks have to be put back </em>(for we are in the presence of)<em> a powerful pagan/Gnostic theological agenda, claiming to be spanking new, objective and scientific, but as old as the hills.&#8221;</p>
<p></em></p>
<p>Clocks have to be turned back, all the way back to the days of Noah in the pre-flood world where evolution is closely connected to the devil’s lie that man is a being who though presently limited in time and space is nevertheless capable of achieving a great leap of being and magically evolving into a much more powerful god-like being in the future.</p>
<p>As the scientifically endarkened Gnostic pagan Spirit of our age simultaneously worships on the altar of ‘self’ as it self-righteously peers down its’ long, pointy nose and contemptuously sniffs and sneers at the remnant of backwards, unscientific, anti-evolution  faithful, in reality it is the entirely deluded pagan Spirit that is on a collision course with a modern version of the pre-flood world catastrophe&#8212;-and we know how badly that ended.</p>

<p>The psychopathic propaganda power brokers are inciting hysteria over expanding their Ukrainian coup operation. Pushing Russia to accept a hostile empire on their border is irrational. Belligerence and intimidation makes indefensible foreign affairs relationships. Those who swallow the &#8220;wag the dog&#8221; script that circulates in the Western mainstream media, deceived or brainwashed, are incapable of any independent thought. The forces that seek unremitting interventionist intrusions that thrive on self-induced chaos are the true threats to world peace.</p>
<p>Until the perception and experience of the intrepid Michael Scheuer becomes universally accepted, the failed foreign policy mistakes will continue as seen in <a href="http://non-intervention.com/1181/russia-annexing-crimea-is-the-cost-of-u-s-eu-intervention-in-ukraine/">Russia annexing Crimea is the cost of U.S.-EU intervention in Ukraine</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Overall, U.S. and Western leaders should be lining up to thank Vladimir Putin for a painful but thorough lesson in how the adult leader of a nation protects his country’s genuine national interests. And, it must be noted, Putin is not teaching rocket science. Had Western leaders received a decent education — especially in the fields of history and human nature — they would have been absolutely certain from the start that any destabilizing Western intervention in Ukraine that even remotely threatened Russia’s assured access to its Crimean naval bases would provoke precisely the kind of Russian response that occurred. They also would have known that West and the UN could bleat forever about the requirements of various treaties and international law, but that a nation acting to protect what it perceives to be life-or-death national interests — as is Putin’s Russia — is both insane and suicidal if it refrains from acting because of a raft of documents designed to address Cold War conditions that no longer exist.</p>
<p>The lesson of the Ukraine crisis — if it ends without war — for the U.S. and the EU will be crystal clear: Hoe your own row, and mind your own business. If it ends in a civil or European war, they will have only themselves to blame.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>With the results from the Crimean referendum in hand the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/crimea-referendum-explainer-ukraine-russia">Guardian</a> newspaper reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The referendum ballot itself, as posted a few days ago to the parliament&#8217;s website, doesn&#8217;t exactly give voters an option to say &#8220;No&#8221;. The two choices are:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Do you support joining Crimea with the Russian Federation as a subject of Russia?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you support restoration of the 1992 Crimean constitution, and Crimea&#8217;s status as part of Ukraine?</p></blockquote>
<p>This second option is somewhat contradictory: the 1992 constitution asserts Crimea is an independent state and not part of Ukraine (reference to autonomy within Ukraine was inserted at a later date). By &#8220;supporting the restoration of the 1992 constitution&#8221; voters will actually support enhanced autonomy. No matter what, voters are ticking a box for independence from Ukraine.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the inimitable and immortal words of that heroine of all <a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/2014/03/13/3094109/apnewsbreak-transgender-troop.html">transgender</a> sociopaths, the former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton sums up the double standard: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka0_nz53CcM">What Difference Does It Make?</a> The bipartisan support for an unbalanced death wish to jump-start the DEFCON alert level, reflected in the comments of <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/gen-dempsey-us-ready-for-military-response-to-russia-if-crimean-conflict-escalates-339144.html">General Dempsey: US ready for military response to Russia if Crimean conflict escalates</a>, should alarm everyone. “We do have treaty obligations with our NATO allies. And I have assured them that if that treaty obligation is triggered [in Europe], we would respond.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a listing of reports on Lessons of the Ukrainian Coup, examine the latest <a href="http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/?u=1f36c52155dbd59aea0b01d76&amp;id=2816c363ed&amp;e=ed5705a7ca">BATR RealPolitik Newsletter &#8211; March 13, 2014</a>. Especially appreciate the Robert Parry article, <a href="http://consortiumnews.com/2014/02/23/neocons-and-the-ukraine-coup/">Neocons and the Ukraine Coup</a>, which targets the perverse mentality of the NeoCon influence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now, you have Assistant Secretary of State Nuland, the wife of prominent neocon Robert Kagan, acting as a leading instigator in the Ukrainian unrest, explicitly seeking to pry the country out of the Russian orbit. Last December, she reminded Ukrainian business leaders that, to help Ukraine achieve “its European aspirations, we have invested more than $5 billion.” She said the U.S. goal was to take “Ukraine into the future that it deserves.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Any attempt to establish sanity in foreign policy must recognize that the betrayers within have sold out America for the last century. Foggy Bottom is the depository of dual loyalists as explained in the Totalitarian Collectivism essay, <a href="http://consortiumnews.com/2014/02/23/neocons-and-the-ukraine-coup/">The State Department&#8217;s New World Order Agenda</a>.</p>
<p>Just who are the maniacal lunatics that drive this insatiable need to threaten continuous war to achieve global imperium? One needs not be a Putin booster to recognize that the post 911 expansions of a garrison mentality guarantees further military expeditions into the internal affairs of any country that bucks the “international community” New World Order goals.</p>

<p>Author of the book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-American-Empire-Rodrigue-Tremblay/dp/0741418878/ref=sr_11_1/104-8428100-2298348?ie=UTF8">The New American Empire</a>”, Rodrigue Tremblay exposes the lunacy behind <a href="http://www.thepeoplesvoice.org/TPV3/Voices.php/2014/03/06/the-bush-obama-s-neocon-foreign-policy-o">The Bush-Obama&#8217;s Neocon Foreign Policy of Isolating Russia and of Expanding NATO is a Dismal Failure</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“President Barack Obama was candid in admitting it on Monday March 3, 2014, when he said that &#8220;we are indicating to the Russians [that] if in fact they continue on the current trajectory they’re on, then we are examining a whole series of steps — economic, diplomatic— that will isolate Russia.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, it is precisely this desire to expand NATO and to isolate Russia by incorporating all the countries bordering Russia into NATO, i.e. a strategy of geopolitical and military encirclement of Russia, which has provoked that country when it felt threatened in its national security.</p>
<p>The truth is that NATO should have been disbanded after the collapse of the Soviet empire in 1991, and especially after the Warsaw Pact was itself dismantled . . . But no! The United States wanted to take advantage of the situation and demanded that everything fell into the military-financial U.S. Empire.”</p>
<p>The Global Gulag essay, <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/021203.html">NATO a Dinosaur Overdue for Extinction</a>, amplifies upon this conclusion.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If the breakdown in NATO is destined to avail an opportunity to curtail the Yankee Hyperpower, the alternative need not be the formation of another suspect alliance. It is not unpatriotic to advocate the wisdom in an America First policy. NATO doesn’t secure an advance for our country, but only provides the military command and enforcement that imposes the will of global masters. Resistance and opposition against an independent EU rapid defense force, comes not from the nations of Europe, but from the elites that control the mechanisms of global power. NATO is one of their tools. Alliances are one of their methods. And suppression of viable self determination is their cherished goal.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Just think what the response would be if Putin reacted to the bellicose threats from EU/NATO/US to intervene into whatever geographic Ukraine composition remains, by re-creating Russian bases in the Western hemisphere? Venezuela becoming the 21th Century Cuba cannot stand. You can hear the cries – no Russian Guantánamo Bay bases in our backyard.</p>
<p>The impotency of superpower status means that the nuclear option becomes executable. This attitude is pure madness, and leads to unilateral imperialism.</p>
<p>When the formidable voice of moral authority, Paul Craig Roberts, warns about <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/03/14/world-war-1-paul-craig-roberts/">World War 1 All Over Again</a>, the nation must come to grips with the fact that the establishment political class is hell bent on running the world by whatever means they decide as they undertake to eliminate any and all opposition to their brinkmanship of NWO jingoism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Did US Secretary of State John Kerry ask you before he delivered an all or nothing ultimatum to Russia? Did he ask Congress? Did he ask the countries of western and eastern Europe–NATO members who Kerry has committed to whatever the consequences will be of Washington’s inflexible, arrogant, aggressive provocation of Russia, a well-armed nuclear power? Did Kerry ask Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Mexico, South America, Africa, China, Central Asia, all of whom would be adversely affected by a world war provoked by the crazed criminals in Washington?”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Absent from a sober and balanced national policy, on what is truly best for the American people, is recognition that the internationalism fostered by Woodrow Wilson has destroyed the Republic. <a href="http://batr.org/americafirst.html">America First</a> requires the acceptance and courage to admit that the globalist coup d&#8217;état, which actually took over and now rules our own country, is the definitive enemy of all humanity.</p>
<p>The treason of the NeoCons and International Libs promote a satanic cosmology, which seeks to destroy any traditional institutional legacy that George Washington elaborated in his <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp">Farewell Address</a>. Risking World War III over Ukraine, especially when the forces of globalism initiated the unrest, is sheer folly.</p>
<p>If there are any real Patriots left in positions of authority within the Federal government, is it now time to enlist in the much-needed second American Revolution? Liberate our own country before starting conflicts that will only result in an existential demise of our nation. The American holocaust planned from within and exercised by commands from traitors is the real reign of terror that faces every truehearted citizen.</p>
<p>An empire necessitates the elimination of the Republic. If Crimea can hold a referendum, only the NWO Jacobins deny the same option for us.</p>

<p>At the onset of the derivatives collapse in 2007/2008 it would have been easy to assume that most of America was receiving a valuable education in normalcy bias.</p>
<p>In 2006, the amount of ego on display surrounding mortgage investment was so disturbingly grotesque anyone with any true understanding of the situation felt like projectile vomiting. To watch the smug righteousness of <em>MSNBC</em> and <em>FOX</em> economic pundits as they predicted the infinite rise of American property markets despite all evidence to the contrary was truly mind blowing. When the whole system imploded, it was difficult to know whether one should laugh, or cry.</p>
<p>The saddest aspect of the credit crisis of 2008 was not the massive chain reaction of bankruptcies or the threat of institutional insolvency. Rather, it was the delusional assumptions of the public that the grand mortgage casino was going to go on forever. There is nothing worse than witnessing the victim of a Ponzi scheme defend the lie which has ultimately destroyed him. As much as I am for people waking up to the nature of the crisis, there comes a point when those who are going to figure it out will figure it out, and the rest are essentially hopeless.</p>
<p>The cultism surrounding the U.S. economy and the U.S. dollar is truly mind boggling, and by “cultism” I mean a blind faith in the fiat currency mechanism that goes beyond all logic, reason and evidence.</p>
<p>In recent weeks it has become more visible as global financiers play both sides of the Ukrainian conflict, luring Americans into a frenzy of false patriotism and an anti-Russo-sports-team-mentality. My personal distaste for Vladimir Putin revolves around my understanding that he is just as much a puppet of the International Monetary Fund and international banks as Barack Obama, but many Americans hate him simply because the mainstream media has designated him the next villain in the fantasy tale of U.S. foreign policy.</p>
<p>Open threats from Russia that they will dump U.S. treasury bond holdings and the dollar’s world reserve status if NATO interferes in the Ukraine have been met with wildly naive chest beating from dollar cultists.  I am beginning to see the talking points everywhere.</p>
<p>“Let them dump the dollar, Russia’s holdings are minimal!” Or, “Let them throw out Treasuries, they’ll just be shooting themselves in the foot!” are the battle cries heard across the web. I wish I could convey how insane this viewpoint is, especially in light of the fact that many alternative economic analysts, including myself, have been predicting just such a scenario for years.</p>
<p>Despite the childish boastings of the dollar devout, there is an extraordinarily good possibility that the life of the greenback will be snuffed out in the near term. Here are the facts…</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Russia will not be alone in its decouple from the dollar system. China, our largest foreign creditor, and India (a supposed ally) have clearly sided with Russia on the Ukranian issue. China has stated that it will back Russia’s play in the event that sanctions are brought to bear by NATO, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ukraine-crisis-china-back-russia-cold-war-over-crimea-1438650" target="_blank">or if a shooting conflict erupts.</a></p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> China has already been slowly dumping the dollar as a world reserve currency using bilateral trade agreements with numerous countries, including Russia, India, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Japan, etc. These agreements allow FOREX currency swaps and export/import purchases to be made with China without the use of the dollar. China has been preparing itself for a divorce from U.S. economic dependence for at least a decade. The idea that they would actually follow through over political tensions should NOT surprise anyone if they have been<a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-11/24/content_11599087.htm" target="_blank">paying attention.</a></p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> A total drop of the dollar or U.S. treasury bonds by Russia and China would send shock waves through global markets. Russia is a major energy supplier for most of Europe. China is the largest export/import nation in the world. If they refuse to accept dollars as a trade mechanism, numerous countries will fall in line to abandon the greenback as well. The fact that so many Americans refuse to acknowledge this reality is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>The only advantage the U.S. has traditionally offered in terms of international trade has been the American consumer, whose unchecked debt spending partly fueled the rise of the industrialized East, not to mention the biggest credit bubble in history. The role of America as a consumer market is collapsing today, however. The mainstream media and the Federal Reserve can blame the steady decline in retail sales on the “weather” all they want, but negative indicators in global manufacturing often take many months to register in the statistics, meaning, this destabilization began long before the days turned cold.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> China has been shifting away from export dependency since at least 2008, calling for a larger consumer based market at home. This process of enriching the Chinese consumer has almost been completed. The lie that China “needs the U.S.” in order to survive economically needs to be thrown out like the <a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90778/8394173.html" target="_blank">utter propaganda it is.</a></p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> China (and most of the world) has ended new dollar purchases for their FOREX reserves, and has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-20/pboc-says-no-longer-in-china-s-favor-to-boost-record-reserves.html" target="_blank">no plans to make new purchases </a>in the future.</p>
<p><strong>6)</strong> China executed the <a href="http://http//money.cnn.com/2014/02/19/investing/china-treasuries/" target="_blank">second largest dump </a>of U.S. Treasury bonds in history in the past month.</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> Russia, China, and numerous other countries, including U.S. “allies”, have been calling for the end of the dollar’s world reserve status and the institution of a <a href="http://http//www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/at-g20-kremlin-to-pitch-new-currency/375364.html" target="_blank">new global basket currency</a>using the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights (SDR). Even Putin has suggested that the IMF take over administration of the global economy and issue the SDR as a world currency system. This flies in the face of those who argue that the IMF is somehow “American run”. The truth is, the IMF is run by global banks and no more answers to the U.S. government than the Federal Reserve answers to the U.S. government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8)</strong> The Federal Reserve has been creating trillions of dollars in fiat just to prop up U.S. markets since 2008, and we are still seeing a considerable decline in global manufacturing, retail, personal home sales, and a general malaise in consumer demand. Without a full audit, there is no way to know exactly how much currency has been generated or how much is floating around in foreign markets. Any loss of world reserve status would send that flood of dollars back into the U.S., most likely ending in a hyperinflationary environment.</p>
<p><strong>9)</strong> Another rather dubious argument I see often is the claim that the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury could simply “negate” a Treasury dump by refusing to acknowledge creditor liabilities. Or, that they could simply print what they need to snap up the bonds, much like the German government tried to do during the Weimar collapse. Unfortunately, this plan did not work out so well for the Germans, nor has it worked for any other nation in history, so I’m not sure why people think the U.S. could pull it off. However, this is the kind of cultism we are surrounded by. These folks think the U.S. economy and the dollar are untouchable.</p>
<p>Yes, the Fed and the Treasury could hypothetically erase existing liabilities, but what dollar cultists do not seem to grasp is that the dollar’s value is not built on Treasury purchases. The dollar’s value is built on faith and reputation. If a nation refuses to pay out on its debts, this is called default. A default by the U.S. would immediately damage the reputation of bonds and dollars as a good investment. Global markets will refuse to purchase or hold any mechanism that they think will not earn them a profit. How many investors today are anxious to jump into Greek treasury bonds, for instance?</p>
<p>Finally, it is unwise to operate on the assumption that foreign creditors will accept dollars as payment on U.S. Treasury bonds if they believe the Federal Reserve is monetizing the debt. When Weimar imploded under the weight of currency devaluation, many foreign governments refused to accept the German mark as payment. Instead, they demanded payment in raw commodities, like coal, lumber and ore. Expect that China and other debt holders will demand payment in U.S. goods, infrastructure, or perhaps even land.</p>
<p><strong>10)</strong> Most treasury holdings in foreign coffers are not long term bonds. Rather, they are short term bonds which mature in weeks or months, instead of years. Dollar proponents constantly cite the continued accumulation of treasury bonds by other governments as a sign that the dollar is still desirable as ever. Unfortunately, they have failed to look at the nature of these bond purchases. When China rolls over millions in short term bonds and replaces them with other short term bonds, this does not suggest they have much faith in America’s long term ability to service its debt. It would also make sense that if China had plans to remove itself from the dollar system, they would move into short term bonds which can be liquidated quickly.</p>
<p><strong>11)</strong> China is on the fast track to becoming the largest holder of physical gold in the world. Russia has also greatly expanded its gold purchases. Whatever losses they might suffer from a dump of their Treasury bond investments; it will be more than made up in the incredible explosion in precious metals prices that would follow.</p>
<p><strong>12)</strong> The most common argument against the dollar losing world reserve status has been that such a shift would be “impossible” because no other currency in the world has the adequate liquidity needed to replace the dollar in global trade. These people have apparently not been paying attention to the Chinese yuan. China has been quietly issuing trillions in yuan denominated bonds, securities and currency around the world. Current estimates calculate around $24 trillion created by the PBOC and the banks under its control.</p>
<p>Mainstream talking heads are calling this a<a href="http://ftmdaily.com/daily-briefing/011014/" target="_blank"> “debt bubble.” </a>However, this debt creation makes perfect sense if China’s plan is to create enough liquidity in its currency in order to offer a viable alternative to the U.S. dollar. Linking the yuan to the IMF’s basket currency would complete the picture, forming a perfect dollar replacement while dollar cheerleading-economists stand dumbstruck.</p>
<p><strong>13)</strong> China&#8217;s retreat away from dollar denominated investments has left a hole in the U.S. bond market.  Recently, that negative space was filled by an unexpected source; <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/02/19/investing/china-treasuries/">namely Belgium</a>.  A country whose GDP represents less than 1% of total global GDP buying more U.S. bonds than China?  The whole concept sounds bizarre.  Here is the capital coming from?</p>
<p>Think about it this way &#8211; Belgium is the political center of the European Union and a haven for international financiers.  There are more corporate cronies, lobbyists, bureaucrats, and foreign dignitaries in Belgium than in all of Washington D.C.  But more importantly, <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2012/pr12471.htm">Belgium struck a deal with the IMF in 2012</a> to begin pumping SDR denominated funds into &#8220;low income economies&#8221;.  I would suggest that this funding flows both ways, and that now, the IMF is feeding capital into Belgium in order to buy U.S. Treasury Bonds.  That is to say, the IMF is going to start using smaller member countries with limited savings as proxies to purchase U.S. debt using IMF money.</p>
<p>The ultimate danger of the IMF (run by internationalists, not the U.S. government) pre-positioning itself as the primary buyer of U.S. debt is that when the U.S. finally defaults (and it will), the IMF is likely to become the &#8220;guardian angel&#8221; of the U.S. economy, offering aid in exchange for total administrative control of our financial system, and the institution of the SDR as a world reserve replacement for the dollar.</p>
<p><strong>14)</strong> The serious prospect of regional conflict or world war over tensions between the Ukraine and Russia, Japan and China, the U.S. and Syria, the U.S. and Iran, the U.S. and North Korea, etc., could make the effort of exposing the plan to shift economic power into a one world system centralized under the IMF almost meaningless.  How many people will truly care about the financial power grab by banking elites if it drifts under the surface of catastrophic engineered wars?  They&#8217;ll be too busy hating and fighting artificially created boogeymen to pay attention to the real globalist culprits.</p>
<p>I have been pointing out for quite a long time that globalists need a “cover event”; a disaster, an economic war or a shooting war, in order to provide a smokescreen for the collapse of the dollar. Alternative analysts have been consistently correct in predicting the trend towards the dump of the dollar. Years ago, we were laughed at for suggesting China would shift towards a consumer based economy and away from U.S. dependence. Today, it is mainstream news. We were laughed at for suggesting that nations like Russia and China would drop the dollar as a reserve currency. Today, they are already in the process of doing it. And, we were laughed at for suggesting that Russia or China would use their debt holdings as leverage against the U.S. in the event of a geopolitical conflict. Today, they are openly making threats.</p>
<p>I have to say, I’ve grown tired of the dollar cultists. How many times can a group of people be wrong and still argue with those who have been consistently right? The answer is that zealots never actually escape their own delusions, even when their delusions lead them and those around them to ruin. I suspect that in the face of complete dollar collapse, they will still be rationalizing the chaos and pontificating on our &#8220;lack of understanding&#8221; while the theater burns down around them.</p>

<p><strong>Newly appointed Prime Minister of Ukraine and former central banker Arseniy Yatsenyuk</strong></p>
<p>A reshuffled Ukrainian Parliament installed following a coup last week has voted to appoint Arseniy Yatsenyuk as the new prime minister of the country. Yats, as <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26079957" target="_blank">Victoria Nuland</a>, the Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs at the U.S. State Department, called him, is a natural choice. He is a millionaire former banker who served as economy minister, foreign minister and parliamentary speaker before Yanukovych took office in 2010. He is a member of Yulie Tymoshenko’s Fatherland Party. Prior to the revolution cooked up by the State Department and executed by ultra-nationalist street thugs, Tymoshenko was incarcerated for embezzlement and other crimes against the people of Ukraine. Now she will be part of the installed government, same as she was after the last orchestrated coup, the Orange Revolution.</p>
<div><iframe id="fitvid38476" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/m0xMtXOilWY?wmode=transparent" height="240" width="520"></iframe></p>
</div>
<p>Yats will deliver Ukraine to the international bankers. “Ukraine is on the brink of bankruptcy and needs to be saved from collapse — Yatsenyuk has a strong economic background,” <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-26/yatsenyuk-named-ukraine-prime-minister-as-default-battle-looms.html" target="_blank">Ariel Cohen</a>, senior fellow at the Washington-based Heritage Foundation, told Bloomberg on Wednesday. “Ukraine faces difficult reforms but without them there won’t be a successful future.”</p>
<p>Discussion with the IMF is crucial, US Treasury Secretary <a href="https://mninews.marketnews.com/index.php/uss-lew-imfs-lagarde-agree-ukraine-needs-imfbilateral-help?q=content/uss-lew-imfs-lagarde-agree-ukraine-needs-imfbilateral-help" target="_blank">Jacob Lew</a> said earlier this week. In order to cinch the deal, the U.S. government will sweeten the pot. Lew talked with the IMF boss, Christine Lagarde, about Ukraine as he headed back from a globalist confab, the G-20 meeting in Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>“Secretary Lew informed Managing Director Lagarde that he had spoken earlier in the day with Ukrainian leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk and advised him of the broad support for an international assistance package centered on the IMF, as soon as the transitional Ukrainian government is fully established by the Parliament,” <a href="https://mninews.marketnews.com/index.php/uss-lew-imfs-lagarde-agree-ukraine-needs-imfbilateral-help?q=content/uss-lew-imfs-lagarde-agree-ukraine-needs-imfbilateral-help" target="_blank">MNI News</a> reported on Monday. “Secretary Lew also noted that he had communicated to Mr. Yatsenyuk the need to quickly begin implementing economic reforms and enter discussions with the IMF following the establishment of the transitional government.”</p>
<p>Ukraine’s story is right out of the IMF playbook. The nation’s corrupt leaders past and present – most notably Tymoshenko, who went to prison for corruption and wholesale thievery – have enriched themselves at the expensive of ordinary Ukrainians.</p>
<p>“Ukraine at the dawn of independence was among the ten most developed countries, and now it drags out a miserable existence,” Communist Party leader <a href="http://www.ukrinform.ua/eng/news/symonenko_interest_on_imf_loans_paid_from_pensions_of_ordinary_ukrainians_311947" target="_blank">Petro Symonenko</a> said last year. The nation’s leaders “signed a memorandum with the International Monetary Fund to meet the requirements of the oligarchs, but on the other hand — to timely pay the interest on the IMF loans and to raise the prices for gas and electricity,” Symonenko said.</p>
<p>The Orange Revolution – initiated by NED, IRI, Soros and the CIA – installed a rogue’s gallery of self-seeking sociopaths who further bankrupted a country already seriously debilitated by corruption.</p>
<p>For the IMF and the financial elite, Ukraine is nothing less than a tantalizing bounty. “Its fertile black soil generated more than one-fourth of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial quantities of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics,” notes <a href="http://www.abo.net/en_IT/publications/reportage/ucraina/ucraina_2.shtml" target="_blank">ABO</a>, a website covering energy resources. “Likewise, its diversified heavy industry supplied the unique equipment (for example, large diameter pipes) and raw materials to industrial and mining sites (vertical drilling apparatus) in other regions of the former USSR.”</p>
<p>After breaking away from the Soviet Union and declaring independence, it was thought the country would “liberalize” its industry and resources, in other words open them up for privatization by transnational corporations and international banks, but this did not happen quickly enough for the financiers and the corporatists.</p>

<p>“The drop in steel prices and Ukraine’s exposure to the global financial crisis due to aggressive foreign borrowing lowered growth in 2008 and the economy contracted more than 15 percent in 2009, among the worst economic performances in the world,” ABO explains. “In August 2010, Ukraine, under the Yanukovych Administration, reached a new agreement with the IMF for a $15.1 billion Stand-By Agreement. Economic growth resumed in 2010 and 2011, buoyed by exports. After initial disbursements, the IMF program stalled in early 2011 due to the Ukrainian Government’s lack of progress in implementing key gas sector reforms, namely gas tariff increases. Economic growth slowed in the second half of 2012 with Ukraine finishing the year in technical recession following two consecutive quarters of negative growth.”</p>
<p>Now that Yanukovych is out of the picture, the banker minion Yats is lording over the Parliament, and thuggish fascists control the streets and guard against a counter revolution that my threaten Wall Street’s coup, the coast is clear for the IMF to pick up where it left off. Ukraine, now one of the poorest countries in Europe thanks to a kleptocracy supported by Washington and Wall Street, is wide open for further looting.</p>

<p><em>Al Nebek, Syria - </em>Who authored the seemingly designed-to-fail UN Security Council Draft Resolution on delivering urgent humanitarian aid into the Old City of Homs and other besieged areas of conflict-torn Syria? When we know this, much may become clearer with respect to the cynical politicization of the continuing civilian suffering.</p>
<p>The draft resolution was put forward by Australia, Luxembourg, and Jordan, and according to a UN/US congressional source—one who actually worked on rounding up the three countries to front for the US and its allies—none was pleased with the decidedly raw and undiplomatic pressure they received from the office of US UN Ambassador Samantha Power.</p>
<p>When this observer inquired how such a poorly drafted, one-sided, adversary-bashing draft resolution could actually have seen the light of day and been submitted to the UN Security Council, the reply he received was terse: “Ask Samantha.”</p>
<p>Suspicions are being raised in Geneva, in Syria, and among certain UN aid agencies, in Homs and elsewhere, that efforts on behalf of those they are trying to save from starvation were ‘set-up’ to fail as a result of power politics and influences emanating from Washington and Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>This observer is not a big fan of conspiracy theories. No doubt it’s a personal congenital defect of some sort that makes him want to hear at least a modicum of relevant, prohibitive, material, non-hearsay evidence to support some of the wilder and internet-fueled claims ricocheting around the globe. However, some things are becoming clear as to what happened at the UNSC last week and why certain specific language was included in the resolution.</p>
<p>Ms. Power, it has been claimed by two Hill staffers who monitor AIPAC, owes her position as UN Ambassador to Israeli PM Netanyahu, who views her and her husband, AIPAC fund raiser, Cass Sunstein, as Israel-first stalwarts. Congressional sources claim the White House went along with her appointment so as not to provoke yet another battle—either with AIPAC’s congressional agents or the wider US Zionist lobby. As part of her continuing gratitude for her “dream job,” as she told an American Jewish Committee convention on 2/10/14 in New York, Ms. Power assured the AJC that the United States “strongly supports Israel&#8217;s candidacy for a seat on the UN Security Council, and we have pushed relentlessly for the full inclusion of Israel across the UN system.” Ms. Power is said to have assured AIPAC officials in private that evening that “one of Israel’s few survival reeds may be to grasp, in the face of rising anti-Semitism, a seat on the council.” Insisting that “there is growing and rampant hostility towards Israel within the UN, where a large number of member states are not democratic,” Ms. Power, continued” <i>“I will never give up and nor should you.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the standing ovation from her adoring audience, she repeated, according to one eye witness: <i>“We have also pushed relentlessly for the full inclusion of Israel across the UN system.&#8221;</i> What the Zionist regime still occupying Palestine knows, as does no doubt Ms. Power, is that the American public and increasingly even the US Congress is finally pulling back from the regime in favor of justice for Palestine. Thus the lobby’s strange reasoning that the UN system, where the American public is essentially absent, is increasingly important.</p>
<p>So what’s the problem with the US-mission-spawned Security Council draft resolution on Syria so dutifully submitted by three chummy and faithful allies?</p>
<p>Well, for starters, the resolution is DOA, as presumably every sophomore poli-sci, civics, or governance student would have recognized from the outset. The aggressive language—demanding the UNSC immediately take action by targeting only one claimed violator with yet more international sanctions—would have caused chaff and cringing among many, probably most. But even beyond that, Moscow, with a UNSC veto ready to use, sees the US-initiated draft as a bid to lay the groundwork for military strikes against the Syrian government, interpreting the language as an ultimatum: that if all this isn’t solved in two weeks then the Security Council will automatically follow with sanctions against the Syrian government.</p>
<p>As Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov told the media on 2/10/14, “Instead of engaging in everyday, meticulous work to resolve problems that block deliveries of humanitarian aid, they see a new resolution as some kind of simplistic solution detached from reality.”</p>
<p>The draft text, obtained by this observer from Reuters, expresses the intent to impose sanctions—on individuals and entities obstructing aid—if certain demands are not met within the next two weeks.</p>
<p>“It is unacceptable to us in the form in which it is now being prepared, and we, of course, will not let it through,” said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov.</p>
<p>One diplomat in Syria, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Vitaly Churkin, Russia’s permanent representative to the UN, had told the Security Council on 2/11/14 that Moscow opposes some 30 percent of the original draft, but did not specify what which parts. He added, “We’re not aiming for a Russian veto, we’re aiming for a resolution that everybody can agree. That is what we want.”</p>
<p>For his part, President Obama, speaking at a joint news conference in Washington with French President Francois Hollande, kept up the pressure for the Security Council to accept the US resolution. He insisted that there is “great unanimity among most of the Security Council” in favor of the resolution and “Russia is a holdout.” Secretary of State John Kerry and others have “delivered a very direct message” pressuring the Russians to drop their opposition.</p>
<p>“It is not just the Syrians that are responsible” for the plight of civilians, but “the Russians as well if they are blocking this kind of resolution,” Kerry claimed. “How you can object to humanitarian corridors? Why would you prevent the vote of a resolution if, in good faith, it is all about saving human lives?”</p>
<p>Among international observers, the draft resolution is widely viewed as one-sided, condemning rights abuses by Syrian authorities, demanding Syrian forces stop all aerial bombardment of cities and towns as well as indiscriminate use of bombs, rockets and related weapons. It also, parenthetically and somewhat obliquely, condemns “increased terrorist attacks,” and calls for the withdrawal of all foreign fighters from Syria, but the latter language is believed to be aimed mainly at Hezbollah. Sources in Syria claim that the draft heaps all the blame on the Syrian government without devoting the necessary attention to the humanitarian problems created by the actions of the rebels.</p>
<p>These gratuitous draft elements are not only aggressive, but frankly appear calculated to end serious discussion and to undermine a solution of the problem.</p>
<p>Being new on the job is one thing for Ms. Power (she has served as UN ambassador only since August of last year), but politicizing relief from starvation for a besieged civilian population is quite another. Likewise for promoting a draft resolution focusing all blame on one side. Such things violate a broad range of applicable and mandatory international norms, and if Ms. Power is hazy on this subject, the State Department’s Office of International Organization Affairs is not—or at least was not when this observer interned there following law school years ago.</p>
<p>Language that would have stood a much better chance of ending the siege of Homs, Yarmouk and other areas under siege was drafted this week by a Syrian law student at the Damascus University Faculty of Law. The widely esteemed university witnessed the death of 17 of its students, along with the serious injuring of more than 20 others, when rebel mortar bombs, on 3/28/13, targeted the canteen of the College of Architecture. Those responsible for the shelling later admitted they were trained and armed by agents of the US government.</p>
<p>The DU law student’s draft resolution on unfettered humanitarian aid into besieged areas of Syria will hopefully be widely discussed over the weekend at a news conference tentatively scheduled on campus. Perhaps the next UN draft resolution will reflect the student’s homework assignment.</p>
<p>The starving victims besieged in Syria, and all people of goodwill, are demanding immediate, non-politicized humanitarian aid without further delay. Virtually every American voter is in a position to pressure his or her congressional representative, and would possibly achieve much good by making the White House aware of their demands to end playing international ‘gotcha’ politics, and to cooperate to end the needless deaths by starvation that continue today.</p>

<h3>&#8220;Bias in favor of the orthodox is frequently mistaken for ‘objectivity’. Departures from this ideological orthodoxy are themselves dismissed as ideological.&#8221; – Michael Parenti</h3>
<p>An exchange in January with Paul Farhi, <em>Washington Post</em> columnist, about coverage of US foreign policy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Mr. Farhi,</p>
<p>Now that you’ve done a study of al-Jazeera’s political bias in supporting Mohamed Morsi in Egypt, is it perhaps now time for a study of the US mass media’s bias on US foreign policy? And if you doubt the extent and depth of this bias, consider this:</p>
<p>There are more than 1,400 daily newspapers in the United States. Can you name a single paper, or a single TV network, that was unequivocally opposed to the American wars carried out against Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, Panama, Grenada, and Vietnam? Or even opposed to any two of these wars? How about one? In 1968, six years into the Vietnam war, the <em>Boston Globe</em>  surveyed the editorial positions of 39 leading US papers concerning the war and found that “none advocated a pull-out”.</p>
<p>Now, can you name an American daily newspaper or TV network that more or less gives any support to any US government ODE (Officially Designated Enemy)? Like Hugo Chávez of Venezuela or his successor, Nicolás Maduro; Fidel or Raúl Castro of Cuba; Bashar al-Assad of Syria; Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran; Rafael Correa of Ecuador; or Evo Morales of Bolivia? I mean that presents the ODE’s point of view in a reasonably fair manner most of the time? Or any ODE of the recent past like Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, Moammar Gaddafi of Libya, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, or Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti?</p>
<p>Who in the mainstream media supports Hamas of Gaza? Or Hezbollah of Lebanon? Who in the mainstream media is outspokenly critical of Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians? And keeps his or her job?</p>
<p>Who in the mainstream media treats Julian Assange or Chelsea Manning as the heroes they are?</p>
<p>And this same mainstream media tell us that Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador, et al. do not have a real opposition media.</p>
<p>The ideology of the American mainstream media is the belief that they don’t have any ideology; that they are instead what they call “objective”. I submit that there is something more important in journalism than objectivity. It is capturing the essence, or the truth, if you will, with the proper context and history. This can, as well, serve as “enlightenment”.</p>
<p>It’s been said that the political spectrum concerning US foreign policy in the America mainstream media “runs the gamut from A to B”.</p>
<p>Sincerely, William Blum, Washington, DC</p></blockquote>
<p>(followed by some of my writing credentials)</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Reply from Paul Farhi:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think you’re conflating news coverage with editorial policy. They are not the same. What a newspaper advocates on its editorial page (the Vietnam example you cite) isn’t the same as what or how the story is covered in the news columns. News MAY have some advocacy in it, but it’s not supposed to, and not nearly as overt or blatant as an editorial or opinion column. Go back over all of your ODE examples and ask yourself if the news coverage was the same as the opinions about those ODEs. In most cases. I doubt it was.</p></blockquote>
<p>–</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Mr. Farhi,</p>
<p>Thank you for your remarkably prompt answer.</p>
<p>Your point about the difference between news coverage and editorial policy is important, but the fact is, as a daily, and careful, reader of the <em>Post</em> for the past 20 years I can attest to the extensive bias in its foreign policy coverage in the areas I listed. Juan Ferrero in Latin America and Kathy Lally in the Mideast are but two prime examples. The bias, most commonly, is one of omission more than commission; which is to say it’s what they leave out that distorts the news more than any factual errors or out-and-out lies. My <em>Anti-Empire Report</em> contains many examples of these omissions, as well as some errors of commission.</p>
<p>Incidentally, since 1995 I have written dozens of letters to the Post pointing out errors in foreign-policy coverage. Not one has been printed.</p>
<p>Happy New Year</p></blockquote>
<p>–</p>
<p>I present here an extreme example of bias by omission, in the entire American mainstream media: In my <a href="http://williamblum.org/aer/read/124">last report</a> I wrote of the committee appointed by the president to study NSA abuses – Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies – which actually came up with a few unexpected recommendations in its report presented December 13, the most interesting of which perhaps are these two:</p>
<p>“Governments should not use surveillance to steal industry secrets to advantage their domestic industry.”</p>
<p>“Governments should not use their offensive cyber capabilities to change the amounts held in financial accounts or otherwise manipulate the financial systems.”</p>
<p>So what do we have here? The NSA being used to steal industrial secrets; nothing to do with fighting terrorism. And the NSA stealing money and otherwise sabotaging unnamed financial systems, which may also represent gaining industrial advantage for the United States.</p>
<p>Long-time readers of this report may have come to the realization that I’m not an ecstatic admirer of US foreign policy. But this stuff shocks even me. It’s the gross pettiness of “The World’s Only Superpower”.</p>
<p>A careful search of the extensive Lexis-Nexis database failed to turn up a single American mainstream media source, print or broadcast, that mentioned this revelation. I found it only on those websites which carried my report, plus three other sites: Techdirt, Lawfare, and Crikey (First Digital Media).</p>
<p>For another very interesting and extreme example of bias by omission, as well as commission, very typical of US foreign policy coverage in the mainstream media: First read the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/at-markets-chavez-successor-falls-short/2014/01/31/ac85c62a-8518-11e3-a273-6ffd9cf9f4ba_story.html" target="_blank">January 31, page one, Washington Post article</a> making fun of socialism in Venezuela and Cuba.</p>
<p>Then <a href="http://williamblum.org/aer-125-letters">read the response from two Americans</a> who have spent a lot of time in Venezuela, are fluent in Spanish, and whose opinions about the article I solicited.</p>
<p>I lived in Chile during the 1972-73 period under Salvadore Allende and his Socialist Party. The conservative Chilean media’s sarcastic claims at the time about shortages and socialist incompetence were identical to what we’ve been seeing for years in the United States concerning Venezuela and Cuba. The <em>Washington Post</em> article on Venezuela referred to above could have been lifted out of Chile’s <em>El Mercurio</em>, 1973.</p>
<p>[Note to readers: Please do not send me the usual complaints about my using the name “America(n)” to refer to “The United States”. I find it to be a meaningless issue, if not plain silly.]</p>
<h3>JFK, RFK, and some myths about US foreign policy</h3>
<p>On April 30, 1964, five months after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, was interviewed by John B. Martin in one of a series of oral history sessions with RFK. Part of the interview appears in the book “JFK Conservative” by Ira Stoll, published three months ago. (pages 192-3)</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>RFK:</strong> The president … had a strong, overwhelming reason for being in Vietnam and that we should win the war in Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>MARTIN:</strong> What was the overwhelming reason?</p>
<p><strong>RFK:</strong> Just the loss of all of Southeast Asia if you lost Vietnam. I think everybody was quite clear that the rest of Southeast Asia would fall.</p>
<p><strong>MARTIN:</strong> What if it did?</p>
<p><strong>RFK:</strong> Just have profound effects as far as our position throughout the world, and our position in a rather vital part of the world. Also it would affect what happened in India, of course, which in turn has an effect on the Middle East. Just as it would have, everybody felt, a very adverse effect. It would have an effect on Indonesia, hundred million population. All of those countries would be affected by the fall of Vietnam to the Communists.</p>
<p><strong>MARTIN:</strong> There was never any consideration given to pulling out?</p>
<p><strong>RFK:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>MARTIN:</strong> … The president was convinced that we had to keep, had to stay in there …</p>
<p><strong>RFK:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>MARTIN:</strong> … And couldn’t lose it.</p>
<p><strong>RFK:</strong> Yes.</p></blockquote>
<p>These remarks are rather instructive from several points of view:</p>
<ol>
<li>Robert Kennedy contradicts the many people who are convinced that, had he lived, JFK would have brought the US involvement in Vietnam to a fairly prompt end, instead of it continuing for ten more terrible years. The author, Stoll, quotes a few of these people. And these other statements are just as convincing as RFK’s statements presented here. And if that is not confusing enough, Stoll then quotes RFK himself in 1967 speaking unmistakably in support of the war.
<p>It appears that we’ll never know with any kind of certainty what would have happened if JFK had not been assassinated, but I still go by his Cold War record in concluding that US foreign policy would have continued along its imperial, anti-communist path. In Kennedy’s short time in office the United States unleashed many different types of hostility, from attempts to overthrow governments and suppress political movements to assassination attempts against leaders and actual military combat; with one or more of these occurring in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, British Guiana, Iraq, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Cuba and Brazil.</li>
<li>“Just have profound effects as far as our position throughout the world, and our position in a rather vital part of the world.”
<p>Ah yes, a vital part of the world. Has there ever been any part of the world, or any country, that the US has intervened in that was not vital? Vital to American interests? Vital to our national security? Of great strategic importance? Here’s President Carter in his 1980 State of the Union Address: “An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America”.</p>
<p>“What a country calls its vital economic interests are not the things which enable its citizens to live, but the things which enable it to make war.” – Simone Weil (1909-1943), French philosopher</li>
<li>If the US lost Vietnam “everybody was quite clear that the rest of Southeast Asia would fall.”
<p>As I once wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus it was that the worst of Washington’s fears had come to pass: All of Indochina – Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos – had fallen to the Communists. During the initial period of US involvement in Indochina in the 1950s, John Foster Dulles, Dwight Eisenhower and other American officials regularly issued doomsday pronouncements of the type known as the “Domino Theory”, warning that if Indochina should fall, other nations in Asia would topple over as well. In one instance, President Eisenhower listed no less than Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Indonesia amongst the anticipated “falling dominos”.</p>
<p>Such warnings were repeated periodically over the next decade by succeeding administrations and other supporters of US policy in Indochina as a key argument in defense of such policy. The fact that these ominous predictions turned out to have no basis in reality did not deter Washington officialdom from promulgating the same dogma up until the 1990s about almost each new world “trouble-spot”, testimony to their unshakable faith in the existence and inter-workings of the International Communist Conspiracy.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Killing suicide</h3>
<p>Suicide bombers have become an international tragedy. One can not sit in a restaurant or wait for a bus or go for a walk downtown, in Afghanistan or Pakistan or Iraq or Russia or Syria and elsewhere without fearing for one’s life from a person walking innocently by or a car that just quietly parked nearby. The Pentagon has been working for years to devise a means of countering this powerful weapon.</p>
<p>As far as we know, they haven’t come up with anything. So I’d like to suggest a possible solution. Go to the very source. Flood selected Islamic societies with this message: “There is no heavenly reward for dying a martyr. There are no 72 beautiful virgins waiting to reward you for giving your life for jihad. No virgins at all. No sex at all.”</p>
<p>Using every means of communication, from Facebook to skywriting, from billboards to television, plant the seed of doubt, perhaps the very first such seed the young men have ever experienced. As some wise anonymous soul once wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>A person is unambivalent only with regard to those few beliefs, attitudes and characteristics which are truly universal in his experience. Thus a man might believe that the world is flat without really being aware that he did so – if everyone in his society shared the assumption. The flatness of the world would be simply a “self-evident” fact. But if he once became <em>conscious</em> of thinking that the world is flat, he would be capable of conceiving that it might be otherwise. He might then be spurred to invent elaborate proofs of its flatness, but he would have lost the innocence of absolute and unambivalent belief.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have to capture the minds of these suicide bombers. At the same time we can work on our own soldiers. Making them fully conscious of their belief, their precious belief, that their government means well, that they’re fighting for freedom and democracy, and for that thing called “American exceptionalism”. It could save them from committing their own form of suicide.</p>

</div>
<p>An editorial in the Financial Times last week, entitled “End drift to war in the East China Sea,” highlighted the growing alarm in ruling circles about the prospect of a conflict between Japan and China. “The possibility of war,” it declared, “is rapidly emerging as one of the biggest security risks facing the world,” and the two governments “are doing nothing to make conflict less likely.”</p>
<p>The FT focussed on comments by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in which he explicitly drew the comparison between the current rivalry in East Asia and that between Britain and Germany prior to World War I. “For Japan’s prime minister to allow any comparison with 1914 in Europe is chilling and inflammatory,” it stated.</p>
<p>The immediate source of tensions is the territorial dispute over rocky outcrops in the East China Sea, known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. However, the chief responsibility for inflaming this dangerous flashpoint, along with others throughout the region, lies with the Obama administration’s “pivot to Asia”—a strategy aimed at isolating China economically and diplomatically, and encircling it militarily.</p>
<p>While hypocritically claiming to be “neutral” on the territorial dispute, Washington has repeatedly declared that, in the event of a war over the islands, the US would support its ally Japan. Moreover, as part of the “pivot,” the Obama administration has been restructuring its military bases in Japan and encouraging Japan to remilitarise.</p>
<p>Asia in 2014 does bear a chilling resemblance to Europe in 1914. World War I arose over the intractable competition for spheres of influence between the major powers. As Lenin and Trotsky, the great Marxists of that period explained, it marked the opening of the imperialist epoch—the epoch of the death agony of capitalism.</p>
<p>The global financial crisis that erupted in 2008, the worsening world economic slump and rising geo-political tensions make clear that capitalism has resolved none of the fundamental contradictions that produced the horrors of a century ago.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, US imperialism has plunged into one war of aggression after another—Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya—as well as numerous intrigues and provocations, in a desperate bid to offset its relative economic decline through its military predominance. The installation of Obama as president and his “pivot” to Asia reflected deep concerns in the American establishment that the Bush administration’s focus on the Middle East undermined US hegemony in Asia, including over its cheap labour platforms, above all China, that had become central to corporate profit.</p>
<p>Under Obama, the US has encouraged allies such as Japan and the Philippines to take a more assertive stance in their disputes with China; begun to “rebalance” 60 percent of US air and naval forces to the Indo-Pacific; and is establishing new basing arrangements with Australia and other Asia-Pacific countries as part of its war preparations.</p>
<p>In Japan, the US “pivot” has helped foster the emergence of the right-wing Abe government that, in the space of a year, has increased military spending for the first time in a decade and moved to end constitutional restrictions on the Japanese armed forces. Last month, Abe provocatively visited the notorious Yasukuni Shrine to the country’s war dead—a potent symbol of Japanese militarism in the 1930s and 1940s.</p>
<p>Abe is being driven by the interests of Japanese imperialism, which is not prepared to relinquish its position as a leading power in Asia. In his speech at Davos, Abe dismissed pundits who “called Japan the land of the setting sun” and declared that “a new dawn” was breaking. The two themes of his speech were equally aggressive—thinly-disguised criticisms of China, alongside cut-throat economic measures designed to undermine rivals and turn Japan into one of the “most business-friendly places in the world.”</p>
<p>By likening China to Germany in 1914, Abe is seeking to portray Beijing as a dangerous new menace. Unlike Germany, however, China is not an imperialist power. Despite the size of its economy, it continues to function as a cheap labour platform, completely dependent on foreign corporate investment and technology, as well as the existing centres of finance capital. In the military sphere, the US has an overwhelming preponderance, and a global network of bases and alliances that can threaten Chinese interests anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Backed into a corner by the US over the past four years, the Chinese leadership has responded by offering further economic concessions to the major powers, on the one hand, while boosting military spending and asserting its claims in waters immediately adjacent to the Chinese mainland, on the other. The Beijing regime is whipping up anti-Japanese chauvinism both to justify its military build-up and to divert attention from the extreme social tensions produced by three decades of capitalist restoration.</p>
<p>While drawing attention to the rising danger of war, the Financial Times editorial offered no solution, other than an impotent appeal for “both sides to stop rattling sabres and start talking to one another.” Ignoring the fact that the US “pivot” has stoked the present confrontation, the editorial appealed for Washington to intervene as the voice of peace and reason. Both Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping “should look for a route away from Armageddon before it is too late,” it concluded.</p>
<p>However, as in 1914, the drive to war is being fuelled by the inherent contradictions of capitalism—between global economy and the outmoded nation state system, and private ownership of the means of production and socialised production—that have erupted with full force in the wake of the 2008 global breakdown. The only means of averting the catastrophe being prepared for humanity is the abolition of the bankrupt profit system and the socialist reorganisation of society to meet the social needs of vast majority, not the super-profits of a tiny wealthy elite. The dangers of another world war underscore the necessity of rejecting all forms of nationalism and patriotism and building a unified international anti-war movement of workers and youth in China, Japan, the US and around the world to carry out this urgent task.</p>
