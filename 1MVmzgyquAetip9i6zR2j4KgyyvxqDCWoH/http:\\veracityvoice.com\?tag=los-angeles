<h3 style="color: #222222;">The question is not what pacifism has achieved throughout history, but what has war achieved?</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">Remark made to a pacifist: “If only everyone else would live in the way you recommend, I would gladly live that way as well – but not until everyone else does.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The Pacifist’s reply: “Why then, sir, you would be the last man on earth to do good. I would rather be one of the first.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, 1947, words long cherished by a large majority of the Japanese people:</p>
<blockquote style="color: #222222;">
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">“Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">“In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #222222;">This statement is probably unique amongst the world’s constitutions.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">But on July 1, 2014 the government of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, without changing a word of Article 9, announced a “reinterpretation” of it to allow for military action in conjunction with allies. This decision can be seen as the culmination of a decades-long effort by the United States to wean Japan away from its post-WW2 pacifist constitution and foreign policy and set it back on the righteous path of being a military power once again, only this time acting in coordination with US foreign policy needs.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In the triumphalism of the end of the Second World War, the American occupation of Japan, in the person of General Douglas MacArthur, played a major role in the creation of this constitution. But after the communists came to power in China in 1949, the United States opted for a strong Japan safely ensconced in the anti-communist camp. For pacifism, it’s been downhill ever since … step by step … MacArthur himself ordered the creation of a “national police reserve”, which became the embryo of the future Japanese military … visiting Tokyo in 1956, US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles told Japanese officials: “In the past, Japan had demonstrated her superiority over the Russians and over China. It was time for Japan to think again of being and acting like a Great Power.”  … various US-Japanese security and defense cooperation treaties, which called on Japan to integrate its military technology with that of the US and NATO … the US supplying new sophisticated military aircraft and destroyers … all manner of Japanese logistical assistance to the US in Washington’s frequent military operations in Asia … repeated US pressure on Japan to increase its military budget and the size of its armed forces … more than a hundred US military bases in Japan, protected by the Japanese military … US-Japanese joint military exercises and joint research on a missile defense system … the US Ambassador to Japan, 2001: “I think the reality of circumstances in the world is going to suggest to the Japanese that they reinterpret or redefine Article 9.”  … Under pressure from Washington, Japan sent several naval vessels to the Indian Ocean to refuel US and British warships as part of the Afghanistan campaign in 2002, then sent non-combat forces to Iraq to assist the American war as well as to East Timor, another made-in-America war scenario … US Secretary of State Colin Powell, 2004: “If Japan is going to play a full role on the world stage and become a full active participating member of the Security Council, and have the kind of obligations that it would pick up as a member of the Security Council, Article Nine would have to be examined in that light.”  …</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In 2012 Japan was induced to take part in a military exercise with 21 other countries, converging on Hawaii for the largest-ever Rim of the Pacific naval exercises and war games, with a Japanese admiral serving as vice commander of the combined task force.  And so it went … until, finally, on July 1 of this year, the Abe administration announced their historic decision. Abe, it should be noted, is a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, with which the CIA has had a long and intimate connection, even when party leaders were convicted World War 2 war criminals.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">If and when the American empire engages in combat with China or Russia, it appears that Washington will be able to count on their Japanese brothers-in-arms. In the meantime, the many US bases in Japan serve as part of the encirclement of China, and during the Vietnam War the United States used their Japanese bases as launching pads to bomb Vietnam.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The US policies and propaganda not only got rid of the annoying Article 9, but along the way it gave rise to a Japanese version of McCarthyism. A prime example of this is the case of Kimiko Nezu, a 54-year-old Japanese teacher, who was punished by being transferred from school to school, by suspensions, salary cuts, and threats of dismissal because of her refusal to stand during the playing of the national anthem, a World War II song chosen as the anthem in 1999. She opposed the song because it was the same one sung as the Imperial Army set forth from Japan calling for an “eternal reign” of the emperor. At graduation ceremonies in 2004, 198 teachers refused to stand for the song. After a series of fines and disciplinary actions, Nezu and nine other teachers were the only protesters the following year. Nezu was then allowed to teach only when another teacher was present.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">Yankee Blowback</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">The number of children attempting to cross the Mexican border into the United States has risen dramatically in the last five years: In fiscal year 2009 (October 1, 2009 &#8211; September 30, 2010) about 6,000 unaccompanied minors were detained near the border. The US Department of Homeland Security estimates for the fiscal year 2014 the detention of as many as 74,000 unaccompanied minors. Approximately 28% of the children detained this year are from Honduras, 24% from Guatemala, and 21% from El Salvador. The particularly severe increases in Honduran migration are a direct result of the June 28, 2009 military coup that overthrew the democratically-elected president, Manuel Zelaya, after he did things like raising the minimum wage, giving subsidies to small farmers, and instituting free education. The coup – like so many others in Latin America – was led by a graduate of Washington’s infamous School of the Americas.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">As per the standard Western Hemisphere script, the Honduran coup was followed by the abusive policies of the new regime, loyally supported by the United States. The State Department was virtually alone in the Western Hemisphere in not unequivocally condemning the Honduran coup. Indeed, the Obama administration has refused to call it a coup, which, under American law, would tie Washington’s hands as to the amount of support it could give the coup government. This denial of reality still persists even though a US embassy cable released by Wikileaks in 2010 declared: “There is no doubt that the military, Supreme Court and National Congress conspired on June 28 [2009] in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch”. Washington’s support of the far-right Honduran government has been unwavering ever since.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The questions concerning immigration into the United States from south of the border go on year after year, with the same issues argued back and forth: What’s the best way to block the flow into the country? How shall we punish those caught here illegally? Should we separate families, which happens when parents are deported but their American-born children remain? Should the police and various other institutions have the right to ask for proof of legal residence from anyone they suspect of being here illegally? Should we punish employers who hire illegal immigrants? Should we grant amnesty to at least some of the immigrants already here for years? … on and on, round and round it goes, decade after decade. Those in the US generally opposed to immigration make it a point to declare that the United States does not have any moral obligation to take in these Latino immigrants.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">But the counter-argument to this last point is almost never mentioned: Yes, the United States does indeed have a moral obligation because so many of the immigrants are escaping a situation in their homeland made hopeless by American intervention and policy. In addition to Honduras, Washington overthrew progressive governments which were sincerely committed to fighting poverty in Guatemala and Nicaragua; while in El Salvador the US played a major role in suppressing a movement striving to install such a government. And in Mexico, though Washington has not intervened militarily since 1919, over the years the US has been providing training, arms, and surveillance technology to Mexico’s police and armed forces to better their ability to suppress their own people’s aspirations, as in Chiapas, and this has added to the influx of the oppressed to the United States, irony notwithstanding.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Moreover, Washington’s North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has brought a flood of cheap, subsidized US agricultural products into Mexico, ravaging campesino communities and driving many Mexican farmers off the land when they couldn’t compete with the giant from the north. The subsequent Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) has brought the same joys to the people of that area.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">These “free trade” agreements – as they do all over the world – also result in government enterprises being privatized, the regulation of corporations being reduced, and cuts to the social budget. Add to this the displacement of communities by foreign mining projects and the drastic US-led militarization of the War on Drugs with accompanying violence and you have the perfect storm of suffering followed by the attempt to escape from suffering.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">It’s not that all these people prefer to live in the United States. They’d much rather remain with their families and friends, be able to speak their native language at all times, and avoid the hardships imposed on them by American police and other right-wingers.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">M’lady Hillary</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">Madame Clinton, in her new memoir, referring to her 2002 Senate vote supporting military action in Iraq, says: “I thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had. And I wasn’t alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong. Plain and simple.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In a 2006 TV interview, Clinton said: “Obviously, if we knew then what we know now, there wouldn’t have been a vote. And I certainly wouldn’t have voted that way.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">On October 16, 2002 the US Congress adopted a joint resolution titled “Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq”. This was done in the face of numerous protests and other political events against an American invasion.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">On February 15, 2003, a month before the actual invasion, there was a coordinated protest around the world in which people in some 60 countries marched in a last desperate attempt to stop the war from happening. It has been described as “the largest protest event in human history.” Estimations of the total number of participants involved reach 30 million. The protest in Rome involved around three million people, and is listed in the 2004 Guinness Book of World Records as the largest anti-war rally in history. Madrid hosted the second largest rally with more than 1½ million protesters. About half a million marched in the United States. How many demonstrations in support of the war can be cited? It can be said that the day was one of humanity’s finest moments.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">So what did all these people know that Hillary Clinton didn’t know? What information did they have access to that she as a member of Congress did not have?</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The answer to both questions is of course “Nothing”. She voted the way she did because she was, as she remains today, a wholly committed supporter of the Empire and its unending wars.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">And what did the actual war teach her? Here she is in 2007, after four years of horrible death, destruction and torture:</p>
<blockquote style="color: #222222;">
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">“The American military has done its job. Look what they accomplished. They got rid of Saddam Hussein. They gave the Iraqis a chance for free and fair elections. They gave the Iraqi government the chance to begin to demonstrate that it understood its responsibilities to make the hard political decisions necessary to give the people of Iraq a better future. So the American military has succeeded.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #222222;">And she spoke the above words at a conference of liberals, committed liberal Democrats and others further left. She didn’t have to cater to them with any flag-waving pro-war rhetoric; they wanted to hear anti-war rhetoric (and she of course gave them a tiny bit of that as well out of the other side of her mouth), so we can assume that this is how she really feels, if indeed the woman feels anything. The audience, it should be noted, booed her, for the second year in a row.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">“We came, we saw, he died.” – Hillary Clinton as US Secretary of State, <em>giggling</em>, as she referred to the uncivilized and utterly depraved murder of Moammar Gaddafi in 2011.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Imagine Osama bin Laden or some other Islamic leader speaking of September 11, 2001: “We came, we saw, 3,000 died, ha-ha.”</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Aliens visiting Earth would report back to their superiors: ‘It’s quite amazing, those people worship images. They know it and they pretend not to know it.’&#8221;</em> — Hypnotherapist Jack True.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a backgrounder for my mega-collection, <a href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/exit-from-the-matrix/" target="_blank">Exit From The Matrix</a>, which contains many exercises designed to liberate an individual from the standardized perception of reality—and usher in his own creative reality.</p>
<p>Mass mind control focuses on two elements: image and feeling.</p>
<p>By linking the two primary elements, it is possible to short-circuit thought and “cut to the chase,” when it comes to enlisting the allegiance of huge populations.</p>
<p>Two seemingly unrelated events spurred my interest in mass mind control.</p>
<p>On the evening of April 12, 1945, I listened to a radio report on the death of Franklin D Roosevelt. I was seven years old.</p>
<p>I became upset. I didn’t know why. I was angry at my own reaction.</p>
<p>Forty years later, I pulled into a gas station near my apartment in West Los Angeles. I got out of my car and took the cap off my gas tank. I looked to my right and saw Tony Curtis sitting in his car. I was shocked.</p>
<p>A few days later, I began making notes under the heading of “image-emotion cues.” At the time, I was working as a reporter, writing articles for LA Weekly. I knew next to nothing about mind control, MKULTRA, Soviet psychiatric gulags, Chinese re-education programs, or US psychological warfare operations.</p>
<p>But because I had been painting for 25 years, I knew something about the power of images.</p>
<p>I remembered my first exhibition of paintings in LA, at my friend Hadidjah Lamas’ house. We had hung my work in her large living room and dining room. Hadidjah had enlisted the services of a friend who had videotaped me painting in my studio, and at the exhibition she set up a television set out on her patio and continuously played the videocassette.</p>
<p>People came through her front door, almost automatically walked through the house to the patio, as if guided by an unseen hand, and watched the video; then they came back inside and looked at the paintings.</p>
<p>They would stop at a painting and say: “That picture was in the video!” It excited them.</p>
<p>My first note on “image-emotion cues” was, “Investing an image with importance. Projecting emotion into an image.”</p>
<p>Projecting emotion into a newspaper image of the president, FDR. Projecting emotion into the screen image of Tony Curtis. Projecting emotion into a video of a painter working in his studio.</p>
<p>When people encounter an image, when they invest it with importance, they project feeling into the image—and this all happens in a private sphere, a private space.</p>
<p>If this didn’t happen, there would be no way to control populations through images. It wouldn’t work. It all starts with a person setting up his own personal feedback loop that travels from him to an image and back again.</p>
<p>Coming out of World War 2, US psychological warfare operatives knew they could turn their skills to political purposes. They had just succeeded in making Americans believe that all Japanese and German people were horribly evil. They had been able to manipulate imagery successfully in that area. Why couldn’t they shape America’s view of a whole planet that lay beyond personal experience?</p>
<p>They could and they did. But the power to do that emanated from the fact that every person invests images with feeling. That’s where it really starts.</p>
<p>I had seen the 1957 film, Sweet Smell of Success, a number of times. I admired it. Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis gave tremendous performances. When, decades later, I saw Curtis sitting in his car at that gas station, I was “working from” the emotion I had invested in his onscreen image. It produced a sense of shock and paralysis for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Other people might have rushed up to Curtis and asked for his autograph. With me, it was shock, cognitive dissonance. Ditto for the death of FDR. I was working off newspaper pictures I’d seen of him, and the feeling I’d invested in those presidential images. Other people, when FDR died, went out into the street and hugged their neighbors and wept openly. For me, it was upset and shock and anger.</p>
<p>There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with investing emotion in images. It can be exhilarating. It can be uplifting. As a painter, I know this in spades. Putting emotion into images can, in fact, vault you into a different perception of reality.</p>
<p>But on the downside, it can also take you into lockstep with what media/propaganda operatives want you to experience, second-hand.</p>
<p>We focus to such a degree on how we are being manipulated that we don’t stop to consider how we are participating in the operation. And our own role is clear and stark: we invest images with feeling.</p>
<p>So how does one individual’s projection of feeling into an image become a uniform projection of the same feeling into one image, by millions of people? How does what one person invests privately become mass mind control?</p>
<p>Through external instruction or cues. And also, by engendering the idea that there is only a limited palette of emotions to work with in the first place.</p>
<p>Why do millions of people fall into line?</p>
<p>Because they don’t realize they started the whole ball rolling themselves. All they know is: images are connected to feelings.</p>
<p>If they knew they were the real power in the whole operation, if they knew they were investing feelings into images all day long, if they could actually slow down enough to see how they do this….then they would be far less prone to taking instruction about what feelings they “ought to” invest in second-hand images.</p>
<p>Hypnotherapist Jack True unceremoniously put it to me this way: “If a dog could analyze how he got from eating meat to drooling at the sound of a bell that came at feeding time, he could stop drooling.”</p>
<p>(If Chris Matthews could analyze how his own voluntary investment of feeling in the image of Barack Obama sends a tingle up his leg, he could stop tingling.)</p>
<p>We see images of people rioting all over the Middle East. We see burning flags and crowds outside embassies. We’re supposed to invest our own anger and resentment into those images. Unless we’re suddenly told those rioters are actually “the good rebels,” in which case we’re supposed to invest our joy in the images.</p>
<p>We see a picture of miles of flat farmland and (GMO) corn waving in the breeze. We’re supposed to invest that image with feelings of happiness and pride.</p>
<p>Nowhere are we told we can back up a step and realize that we are the ones who begin the whole process, by projecting feelings into images. Any images.</p>
<p>When I was 19, I was sent to a trained expert in New York to take a Rorschach (ink-blot) Test. I was displaying signs of what would now be called Oppositional Defiance Disorder.</p>
<p>The expert said he wanted me to tell him everything I saw in each ink-blot. I took him at his word.</p>
<p>An hour later, I was still working on the first blot. I was describing everything from bats and owls and chickens to space ships and buckets of hidden treasure in caves.</p>
<p>Well, I was cheating a little. I wasn’t really describing what I saw. I was imagining. I was taking off from what was on the page and improvising. This was outside the bounds of the Test.</p>
<p>The expert was seething. He was sweating, because he had many other blots to show me, and it was late in the afternoon, and he was looking at spending the entire evening with me. Finally, he held up his hand and put an end to the Test.</p>
<p>I wasn’t playing his game. Among other sins, I wasn’t investing a limited palette of feelings in the images. Therefore, my choices of “what to see” in the blots expanded greatly.</p>
<p>When I go to a museum, I like to watch people stand in front of abstract paintings. Many of them are stumped. They’re trying to figure out what feelings they “are supposed to” project into the painting. They’re looking for “instruction,” and there isn’t any. They’re asking for mind control, and they’re not getting it.</p>
<p>Fanaticism of any kind begins with individuals projecting feelings into images. This is harnessed by leaders, who then choose the images and direct which feelings are permitted. The tempting prospect for the follower is: participation in a drama that goes beyond what he would ordinarily experience in life. This is bolstered by the idea that what he is doing is moral.</p>
<p>In an election season, people on the left are urged to project messianic feelings into images of X. People on the right are cued to invest feelings of pride, hope, and “tradition” into images of Y. The real candidates aren’t actually experienced.</p>
<p>Since Vietnam, shooting wars have been more difficult to sustain among soldiers. “In the old days,” feelings of hatred could be projected into images of enemies that included civilians, so overtly killing everybody on foreign soil was easier to accept. Now, soldiers are taught “enemy combatant” and “civilian” are two different images that require the injection of two different feelings.</p>
<p>Here at home, police and military are taught, more and more, to invest feelings of suspicion into images of American civilians. This is an acceleration of mass mind control for law enforcement.</p>
<p>The astonishing number of civilians who participate in government and corporate surveillance of the public, through technological means, learn to invest “dead empty feelings” into images of citizens, as if these targets are nothing more than ciphers, units.</p>
<p>Bizarre instances of police detaining and questioning parents who allow their children to play unsupervised reveal another accelerating trend. These confrontations start with neighbors snitching on the parents. The neighbors have learned to invest feelings of panic, suspicion, and anger in images of “free children.”</p>
<p>In all these cases, there is no real experience. It’s all second-hand. It’s all feeling-projected-into-image.</p>
<p>In the medical arena, countless advertisements and news stories are geared to convince people to invest feelings of trust in images of doctors. The suggestion, “Ask your doctor if X is right for you,” is framed as the solution to a little problem. The problem is set this way: Drug X is wonderful; drug X has serious adverse effects; what to do? Solution: ask your doctor; trust him; he knows.</p>
<p>As the class of victims in society has grown by leaps and bounds, including any group that can organize and promote itself as needing help or justice—going miles beyond the people who really do need assistance—citizens have been trained to invest feelings of sympathy and concern for all images of victims everywhere, real or imagined. This, too, is mass mind control.</p>
<p>Pick an image; invest feelings in it. Facts don’t matter. Evidence doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>You’ve heard people say, So-and-so (a celebrity) has become a caricature of himself. Well, that’s what it means. The celebrity has projected massive feelings of approval into a concocted, cartoonish image of himself.</p>
<p>As a society, we can go on this way until we become a horrific cartoon of a cartoon (well, we’re already there), or we can step back and discover how we invest emotion into images, and then use that process to pour feelings into visions of our own choosing and invent better futures.</p>
<p>Since the dawn of time, leaders have portrayed themselves as gods. They’ve assembled teams to promote that image, so their followers could project powerful emotion into the image and thereby cement the leaders’ control and power.</p>
<p>The game isn’t new. Understanding the roots of it within each individual could, however, break the trance of mass mind control.</p>
<p>During the first West Nile fake outbreak of 1999, I spoke with a student who had just dropped out of medical school. He told me he’d been looking at electron-microscope photos of the West Nile Virus, and he suddenly realized he was “supposed to” invest feelings of “great concern” in those images.</p>
<p>Somehow, he broke free from the image-feeling link. He was rather stunned at the experience. His entire conditioning as a medical student evaporated.</p>
<p>Parents all over the world are having the same experience vis-a-vis vaccines. They realize they’re supposed to invest fear in images of germs and disease, and they’re also supposed to invest feelings of hope and confidence in images of needles and vaccines. They see the game. They’re supposed to remain victims of mass mind control.</p>
<p>But they’ve awakened.</p>
<p>We’ve all been taught that what we feel is always and everywhere out of our control. These feelings are simply part of us, and we have to act on them. The alternative would be to sit on them and repress them and turn into androids, robots.</p>
<p>This is simply not true. There are an infinite number of feelings, and as strange as it may sound, we can literally invent them.</p>
<p>This, it is said, is inhuman. It’s a bad idea. It’s wrong. It would lead us to “deserting the human community.”</p>
<p>Nonsense. That’s part of the propaganda of mind control. If the controllers can convince us that we’re working from a limited map of emotions and we have to stay within that territory, they can manipulate that limited set of feelings and trap us.</p>
<p>The power of art is that it shows us there are so many more emotions than we had previously imagined. We can be much freer than we supposed.</p>
<p>The synthetic world of mind control and the handful of feelings that are linked to images is what keeps us in thrall.</p>
<p>The world—the world of what we can be—is so much wider and more thrilling and revealing.</p>

			<p>It is easy to stand up and cheer for your favorite government activity. It is quite another to acknowledge what it means in the real world.</p>
<p>I almost never try to speak for other people. However, I think it is fairly safe to say that the average military recruit firmly believes that he joins the military so that you and I can live and breathe in freedom. To be sure, he had other reasons for joining, but I think the defense of liberty is a fairly common characteristic.</p>
<p>That is certainly what I thought when I was in Navy boot camp in Orlando, Florida, in 1983. After all, this is what I had been told all my life: sailors, soldiers, airmen and marines defend freedom.</p>
<p>But is this actually what they do?</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>This Marine lost both legs in an IED blast in Iraq. He claims he was forced by TSA to <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2013/mar/19/tsa-agents-humiliated-wounded-marine-aggressive-in/" target="_blank">remove both prosthetic legs</a> before he could board an airplane in Phoenix.</li>
<li>This Vietnam veteran in Spicewood, Texas, had <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/08/raids-of-the-day-the-capi_n_2644894.html" target="_blank">flashbacks to his combat experience during a marijuana raid</a> at a friend’s house. What police claimed was marijuana turned out to be ragweed.<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/jared-goering.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/jared-goering.jpg?w=300&amp;h=152" alt="jared goering" width="300" height="152" /></a></li>
<li>Jared Goering, who served 19 years in the Army, including tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, was <a href="http://www.lifewithdogs.tv/2013/08/veteran-kicked-off-boardwalk-for-having-a-service-dog/" target="_blank">kicked off the boardwalk in Wildwood, N.J.</a> for walking with his service dog, Gator.</li>
<li>Emily Yates, who served two tours with the Army in Iraq, was <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=3bf_1378009165" target="_blank">violently arrested by park police in Philadelphia</a> for asking why she couldn’t play her banjo under some shade trees.</li>
<li>Dimitrios Karras is a Marine Corps veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan. Read about the <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/ares-armor-operating-store-camera-caught-first-moments-of-saturday-raid" target="_blank">ATF raid on his business</a> in National City, California.</li>
<li>Martin Goldberg of Brooklyn is a World War II veteran <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/17/raid-of-t_n_3102929.html" target="_blank">whose apartment was subject to a drug raid</a>. Later, the cops realized they had raided the wrong apartment. His 83-year-old wife was hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat as a result of the raid.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/norfolk-41.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/norfolk-41.jpg?w=640" alt="norfolk 4" /></a></li>
<li>In 1997, four sailors from the USS Saipan (LHA-2) were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/magazine/19Norfolk-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">falsely accused</a> of the rape and murder of a Norfolk, Virginia, woman. One spent eight-and-one-half years in prison while the other three were sentenced to life in prison. These three were pardoned in 2009. Even though the actual killer is serving a life sentence, four innocent men are still required to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Four" target="_blank">register as sex offenders</a> and are still <a href="http://www.norfolkfour.com/" target="_blank">fighting to clear their names</a>.</li>

On a trip home to Covina, California, he was hanging out with a few friends when he was arrested for resisting arrest and nothing else. He spent 21 days in Los Angeles County jail, even though he had harmed no one.</li>

<li>John Laigaie, a retired Army master sergeant, was <a href="http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/bellingham-man-wins-15000-settlement-after-city-co/nZPdj/" target="_blank">threatened at gunpoint</a> by police while legally carrying a gun in a park in Bellingham, Washington.</li>
<li>Homer Wright is an 80-year-old Army veteran who was <a href="http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/80-year-old-homeowner-arrested-for-shooting-burglar.html" target="_blank">charged with felony gun use</a> after he shot a burglar who entered his home in Englewood, Illinois.<br />

They did not find any of these items.</li>
<li>Saadiq Long is an Air Force veteran who was placed on a TSA no-fly list. He had to <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/US-Air-Force-Veteran-Fina-by-Glenn-Greenwald-130210-789.html" target="_blank">battle for months</a> to be removed from this list just so he could fly home from Qatar to visit his ailing mother.</li>
<li>Chuck Benton of Long Grove, Iowa, served 22 years in the Army. He was <a href="http://rare.us/story/im-a-christian-and-i-want-to-end-the-drug-war/" target="_blank">arrested and charged</a> simply for living in the same house with his son who was <a href="http://qctimes.com/news/local/medical-marijuana-heads-for-trial-in-iowa/article_3f94aa61-1fe8-5462-b2bf-4d5b598824e4.html" target="_blank">growing medical marijuana</a>.</li>

<li>In 1932, 17,000 veterans marched on Washington to demand payment of bonuses they had been promised as a result of their service in World War I. Two were shot and killed by police. 55 were arrested and 135 were injured when the United States Army became an instrument of domestic law enforcement. Two of the chief enforcers were named MacArthur and Patton. Yes, those two.</li>

<li>Valente and Manuel Valenzuela of San Antonio produced sufficient documentation to enlist, respectively, in the Army and Marine Corps. Both fought in Vietnam, where Valente won a Bronze Star. Now they are <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Vietnam-veterans-at-risk-of-being-deported-4855055.php" target="_blank">facing deportation to Mexico</a> because of erroneous entries on their birth certificates.</li>

A heating malfunction caused the temperature in the cell to soar to 100 degrees.</li>
<li>Kenneth Chamberlain was a retired Marine and Vietnam veteran living in White Plains, New York. Early one morning he set off his medical alert device. The first responders in this case were not medics, but rather <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yu6yIeL6Ts" target="_blank">police, who proceeded to kill Mr. Chamberlain</a>.<br />

<li>Boxing legend Joe Louis was also tyrannized by the IRS. The Brown Bomber enlisted in the Army in 1942 saying “Let us at them Japs.” Louis never saw combat, as he was assigned to the Special Services Division. While still a civilian, Louis fought some charity bouts and donated the proceeds to the Navy Relief Society. The IRS, however, viewed these proceeds as taxable income. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Louis#World_War_II" target="_blank">IRS problems would plague him</a> all his life. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6ayb02bwp0" target="_blank">Please watch this video starting at the 53:17 mark.</a></li>

<li>Radio talk host Adam Kokesh won the Navy Commendation Medal as a Marine in Iraq. In recent years, he has been <a href="http://libertycrier.com/avtm-4-0-crowdfunder-campaign/?utm_source=The+Liberty+Crier&amp;utm_campaign=00062d8203-The_Liberty_Crier_Daily_News_2_5_2014&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_600843dec4-00062d8203-284780633" target="_blank">arrested several times for various non-violent protests</a>. His most recent arrest happened after he loaded a shotgun in public in Washington, D.C. on July 4, 2013. On July 10, police <a href="http://oathkeepers.org/oath/2013/07/12/thoughts-on-the-police-raid-on-adam-kokesh-and-on-his-canceled-march/" target="_blank">violently raided his home and arrested him</a>.

He is currently on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Kokesh" target="_blank">probation for two years</a>. You may not like Kokesh’s demeanor or approve of all of his antics, but he has been very courageous when so many of his critics can’t be bothered to put down the remote.<br />

<li>James Moore, my brothah from anothah mothah, walked away from a very lucrative engineering position in San Jose to re-enlist in the Army following 9/11. He sustained significant physical injuries as well as PTSD while serving in the Special Forces in Afghanistan. On the afternoon of March 25, 2008, Moore, who had done absolutely nothing wrong, was <a href="http://www.freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2012/04/necessary-force.html">beaten to the point of flat lining by Denver police.</a></li>
<li>One of the coolest people I have never met is Antonio Buehler. Buehler graduated from West Point in 1999, earned his Ranger tab, and saw action in Kosovo and Iraq. (He also sports a Stanford MBA.) Early in the morning on January 1, 2012, Buehler <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNVZDpGCKks" target="_blank">was arrested</a> for taking a few pictures of Austin police manhandling a young woman outside a 7-11. Buehler has been arrested four times since. He heads the <a href="http://peacefulstreets.com/" target="_blank">Peaceful Streets Project</a>, whose members work to expose abuse, brutality and overreach both in Austin and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/FreeAntonioBuehler/" target="_blank">across the nation</a>.<br />

</ul>
<p>There are no doubt numerous other injustices against veterans that I do not know about. Enough to fill a book. None of these things would have happened if America were a free society. As Kokesh puts it, “The greatest enemies to the Constitution are not to be found in the sands of some far off land but rather right here at home.”</p>
<p>I cannot speak to the specific political beliefs of most of the veterans I have mentioned here. Some may be pacifists, while others may make John McCain look like a hippie in Haight-Ashbury. No matter what their individual views may be, the freedom they risked their lives for was flagrantly violated on the streets of the land they fought to protect.</p>
<p><a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/ohio_class.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/ohio_class.jpg?w=586" alt="With the ability to carry 192 nuclear warheads, just one Ohio-class submarine is the world's sixth largest nuclear power." /></a></p>
<p>Society endlessly applauds sailors, soldiers, airmen and Marines for “fighting for our freedom”. It is in no way disrespectful to say that this is not what they do. No foreign government or terrorist group poses any threat to our liberty. America accounts for about half of the world’s military spending. We have 300 ships in our Navy, plus thousands of planes, tanks and nuclear warheads as well as 300 million firearms in private hands. Nobody is going to invade us.</p>
<p>In a constitutional country, which America ceased to be 100 years ago, the job of the military – a vital and most noble one – is to defend the borders, shores and airspace. It cannot protect you from being tyrannized domestically. Indeed, throughout history, armies have been instruments of domestic tyranny. Our Constitution forbids a standing army for just this reason.</p>

<p>Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia had enormous military establishments. How did things work out in these countries?</p>
<p>I am a Christian who believes liberty is a gift from God – Leviticus 25:10; II Corinthians 3:17; Galatians 5:1. To quote Jefferson, liberty is preserved not by military might, but by “eternal vigilance” against one’s own government at all levels. It is the grossest form of disrespect to send young men around the world to “fight for freedom” while relinquishing that freedom on the home front.</p>

Since 2001, Americans have gladly accepted previously unthinkable intrusions on their freedom in the name of “safety” and “security”. These include, but are not limited to: <a href="http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig6/napolitano2.html" target="_blank">warrantless searches and spying</a>, the <a href="http://archive.lewrockwell.com/hornberger/hornberger130.html" target="_blank">suspension of habeas corpus</a>, <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2011/07/14/tsa-does-not-protect-you-period/" target="_blank">sexual assault as a condition of travel</a>, rampant <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/350955711587953/" target="_blank">police brutality</a>, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/12/16/three_myths_about_the_detention_bill/" target="_blank">indefinite detention</a> without any semblance of due process, severe <a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2012/05/02/were-almost-there-now/" target="_blank">restrictions on peaceful protest</a>, massive <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphbenko/2013/03/11/1-6-billion-rounds-of-ammo-for-homeland-security-its-time-for-a-national-conversation/" target="_blank">ammunition purchases by DHS</a> and <a href="https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/john_whiteheads_commentary/the_empire_strikes_back_attack_of_the_drones" target="_blank">surveillance drones in our skies</a> watching our every move. Can <a href="http://freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2011/07/imperial-priorities-obedience-first.html" target="_blank">predator drones</a> be far behind?</p>
<p>And in every election 98 percent of voters put their stamp of approval on perpetuating this monstrosity.</p>

<p>On April 20, 2013, <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/20/but-they-got-the-suspect-thats-not-the-point/" target="_blank">Boston and several surrounding towns</a> got a <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/25/lockdowns-do-not-keep-you-safe-letter-to-the-denver-post/" target="_blank">serious taste</a> of <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/23/sometimes-martial-law-is-necessary/" target="_blank">martial law</a>. How many military veterans were on the receiving end of this? Is this what they signed up to fight for?</p>
<p>Stop thinking in clichés. Have a good hard look at everything your media and government tell you. This includes media outlets and parts of the government that you like. Study. Read. Ask questions. And learn that the defense of liberty is not the duty of the military. Rather, it is your duty and mine.</p>

</div>
<p style="color: #000000;">Tony Bennett left his heart in San Francisco — and Michelle Obama left her brain in 1954.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Addressing graduating high-school students the other day in the Topeka, Kansas, school district, the federal lunch lady <a href="http://www.kansas.com/2014/05/16/3460823/michelle-obama-tells-topeka-graduates.html" target="_blank">said</a>, referring to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Brown v. Board of Education</span> decision, “[Y]our experience here in Topeka would have been unimaginable back in 1954….” And perhaps this is true.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It also would have been unimaginable back in 1554 or 954. After all, the institutions making that experience possible hadn’t been birthed yet.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">You know, those institutions created by European/ European-descent civilization.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">That civilization that Darth Vegan is tacitly impugning with her racial agitation.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The point is that if you’re going to talk about the past, don’t tendentiously cherry-pick it for destructive ideological purposes. It’s much as discussion about slavery. Not only is the focus always on the less than one percent of the history of slavery that was written in the US (it’s one of the world’s oldest institutions), but the most significant point is missed: Whites were not the first to practice slavery.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But they were the first to abolish it.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">If some take offense at this, they can pound sand. I take offense at the constant derision aimed at my civilization by critics who should get down on their knees, kiss the ground trod by our ancestors and thank God for our civilization’s existence. Where else could effete ne’er do wells complain about injustice while living a life of silk, satin and Sidwell Friends and dining on Kobe beef?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Really, this all reminds me of how no good deed goes unpunished. This focus on a group’s sins to the exclusion of its triumphs is much like trying to epitomize a cracker-jack golfer by some of his three-putts while ignoring his many championships; it’s like condemning a great rocket engineer over a few failed trial launches and ignoring that he got you to the moon.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">M. Obama also <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/michelle-obama-race-brown-v-board-of-education-106784.html" target="_blank">said</a> to the students, “We know that today in America, too many folks are still stopped on the street because of the color of their skin….” This is absolutely true. Just this past Mother’s Day weekend a white family was <a href="http://selwynduke.typepad.com/selwyndukecom/2014/05/white-vacationers-attacked-by-black-mob.html" target="_blank">stopped and beaten</a> by a black mob because of the color of their skin.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, these black-on-white racial attacks — already a frequent but largely unreported phenomenon — will only worsen with racial hustlers such as the Obamas peddling their “series of agreed-upon myths,” to use Napoleon’s characterization of history.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And this agitation has its effect. Just consider the testimonial Reverend Jesse Lee Peterson, president of the Brotherhood Organization for a New Destiny (BOND), gave about how race-hustling affected his attitude prior to his religious conversion. He said in a 2013 <span style="font-style: italic;">Los Angeles Times</span> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-oe-0814-morrison-peterson-20130814-column.html#page=1" target="_blank">interview</a>, “I believed the lie that because I was black, I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to make it because of the white man&#8230;. I was listening to people like Jackson and Louis Farrakhan&#8230;. He talked about the blue-eyed devil, and I believed him. I started hating white people.” And since most people don’t experience religious conversions, what’s the result of this brainwashing?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It’s that now, “not all but most black people are so racist toward white people,” Peterson explained.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And this explains the Obamas. They are obsessed with race.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Obsessed.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And what, America, did you expect when electing a far-left, radical, black-liberation-theology-<wbr></wbr>church-attending, Marxist-leaning, terrorist-consorting ex-socialist-party member who cut his political teeth in the Chicago machine? Mr. Smith goes to Washington?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Well, it was actually Uncle Sam goes to Hell.</p>

<p>Sometimes I just want to pimp slap people.</p>
<p>Last summer, I was at dinner during a sales convention. The conversation didn’t get political until someone mentioned the NSA.</p>
<p>There is one in every crowd. Someone piped up and said, “They can spy on me all they want. I am not doing anything wrong.”</p>
<p>They sang this song in Germany in 1933. And they sang it with unprecedented gusto in the months following 9/11, all in the name of  “security” and “keeping us safe”.</p>
<p>We were at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, the world’s second largest hotel. Nothing in the post-9/11 “national security” apparatus would prevent a terrorist from walking in, setting off a bomb, and killing hundreds or even thousands of people.</p>
<p>The more important questions are: How do you know you are doing nothing that could be construed as wrong by some state functionary? How do you know you are not breaking some law somewhere? And why are you so implicitly trusting that your government would never do anything evil with the information it has collected on you?</p>
<p>This is not purely an academic matter. The practical implications are profound.</p>
<p>I give you several examples.</p>
<p>1. Niakea Williams went to her son’s St. Louis-area elementary school one day to pick up her son, who has Asperger’s. The school was put on lockdown and <a href="http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Mother-arrested-at-school-for-consoling-son-in-local-classroom-251349481.html">Mrs. Williams was escorted out in handcuffs.</a></p>
<p>2. Adrionna Harris was <a href="http://wavy.com/2014/03/19/student-suspended-for-taking-razor-from-self-harming-classmate/">almost expelled from her middle school</a> in Virginia Beach after taking a razor blade away from a fellow student who was trying to harm himself.</p>
<p>3. Read what <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2014/01/17/houston-police-just-assume-guy-giving-ch">Houston police did</a> to this man who gave 75 cents to a homeless person.</p>
<p>4. A little known Denver parking ordinance can get you a $25 fine <a href="http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/little-known-parking-ordinance-could-get-you-25-ticket-even-if-you-havent-exceeded-time-limits">even if you haven’t exceeded the two-hour limit.</a></p>
<p>5. Police in Iowa City, Iowa, <a href="http://ij.org/iowa-cops-seize-almost-50-000-from-a-couple-didn-t-charge-them-with-a-crime">seized $50,000</a> from this couple without charging them with a crime.</p>
<p>6. Alberto Willmore lost his teaching job in Manhattan over a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEzZSDKOVM4#t=321">totally bogus marijuana arrest.</a> Even though he was never convicted of anything, he was unable to get his job back.</p>
<p>7. Norman Gurley was arrested in Lorain County, Ohio, because a compartment in his car <a href="http://www.wkyc.com/story/news/local/2013/11/20/trap-car-law/3655713/">could have been used to transport drugs.</a></p>
<p>8. Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies <a href="http://www.ijreview.com/2014/02/115178-police-shoot-kill-80-year-old-man-bed/">shot and killed 80-year-old Eugene Mallory</a> in his own bed during a meth raid. No meth, or any other illegal drugs, was discovered.</p>
<p>9. Paul Valin contacted police to report that he found a backpack full of what he believed to be meth-making equipment 15 miles from his home near Des Moines. As a result, the DEA placed his house <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/28/mans-good-deed-lands-his-home-on-dea-list-meth-labs/?intcmp=latestnews">on its list of meth labs.</a></p>

<p>Also, consider the following:</p>
<p>• The Internal Revenue Code is <a href="http://www.cch.com/wbot2013/factsheet.pdf">73,955 pages</a> and millions of words long. No one has read it cover-to-cover and no one knows every aspect of it. Yet if anyone violates any of its provisions it can mean fines, prison or even death.</p>

</div>
<p style="color: #000000;">For the record, I don’t believe Cliven Bundy is a “racist.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For the record, I don’t even care.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Such indifference to that damnable failing, that thing we all know is the worst thing one can be, must make me a damnable man. But I am flexible. I just want equality. I’m perfectly willing to demonize “racists,” provided we give other sinners equal time.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">I just want to hear, for example, “Forget the facts of the matter! The man is lustful!” or “Don’t listen to that miscreant. He’s guilty of sloth!” Or let’s say a fellow posits an opinion on, oh, taxation. Our very intellectual response could be, “Hey, didn’t I hear you talkin’ to your girlfriend about how you scarfed down four cheeseburgers at the barbecue and binged on ice cream in your easy chair? Look, everyone, he’s a glutton!”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This isn’t to say that being a bigot — the word “racist” is in quotation marks because it’s an invention of leftist language manipulators — is a good thing. Not at all. But neither is being lustful, slothful or gluttonous. Yet people who couldn’t name three of the Seven Deadly Sins and are thoroughly guilty of at least six, will claim they can disqualify a person, and his point of view, from debate based on their assessment of his moral state. What blindness — and hubris.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Bigotry is simply a sub-category of wrath, one part of one-seventh, not the moral end-all and be-all. And even if Bundy did have racial hang-ups, would it follow that he was wrong about his case or on federal power in general? Can a man be flawed, and even sinful, but yet right on a matter? Can he still have virtues? Albert Einstein could be lewd and lascivious, Galileo an irascible jerk, Ernest Hemingway was a drunkard.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This isn’t to say, as certain people with poor character once averred, that character doesn’t matter. It’s not to say a person’s vices can’t speak to motivations; it’s valid to point it out if a judge who rules that pornography has First Amendment protections habitually views porn himself. But it’s not valid to fixate on the allegedly “racist” tendencies of a judge who rules that racial commentary enjoys such protections (at least not within the context of analyzing the ruling). The difference is that since the former is wrong, there’s good reason to believe that his personal inclinations corrupted his judgment on the matter; with the latter judge, however, dwelling on the supposed flaw in question would only serve to discredit a legitimate ruling.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The point is that we all have flaws, yet all can be correct about a whole host of things. I wouldn’t have wanted Einstein to care for a teenage daughter or be president, but I wouldn’t deny that E=mc2.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, it really is true that some flaws are more unequal than others — there is a hierarchy of sin — but moderns’ sense of proportion is highly askew. G.K. Chesterton said that a “Puritan is a person who pours righteous indignation into the wrong things.” Today we have Impuritans, complete reprobates worshipping at hedonism’s altar, who pour their indignation onto others in a vain attempt to wash their own souls clean of sin. But there is much more to being a “good” person than simply not being bigoted.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">To further illustrate this askew sense of proportion, consider again the gluttony example. Gluttony is a sin, no doubt. But now let’s say that our society considered it the ultimate disqualifier. Let’s say we might scrutinize a person, asking “What are his food bills?” “Do cookbooks figure too prominently in his library?” “Does he wile away excessive time watching <span style="font-style: italic;">Emeril Live</span>?” “Is he the one who cleared the buffet table like a hurdler?” And imagine we visited pariah status on the person after deeming him guilty.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Would you think this society’s greater fault was gluttony — or being hung-up about it? I’d think it exhibited a gluttonous zeal for eradicating gluttony.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The problem is that man always swings from one extreme to another. The early to mid 20th century saw the embrace of eugenics and racial-superiority dogma, which was then discredited by the loathsome Nazis. But now we just as zealously impose a dogma denying the reality of group differences and mandating equality of outcome among races.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This tendency toward true extremism — meaning, extreme deviation from Truth — brings to mind C.S. Lewis’ observation that evil always tries to persuade us to exaggerate our flaws, telling the militant he’s too pacifistic and the pacifist that he’s too militant. As an example, today we have Impuritans who, awash in the Great Sexual Heresy, will still lament how “Puritan” America is so sexually “repressed.” Evil tells the pervert he’s too prudish, just as it tells self-hating whites that they’re too anti-black.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But what we should be is anti-“racism.” I don’t mean what you think. We need to oppose both the word and the concept — at least how the latter is often conceptualized.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Bigotry is bad by definition, and that definition is commonly agreed upon. But “racism” often has a different meaning, one whose influence is readily apparent in the reaction to Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling’s much reported comments. Al Sharpton, who once used the term “white interlopers” and once said, “White folks was in caves while we were building empires…,” called for a boycott of the NBA. Former hoop star Larry Johnson reacted to a man who didn’t want blacks around by saying he didn’t want whites around, as he suggested creating an all-black basketball league. Spike Lee <a href="http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/04/29/spike-lee-sterling-has-mentality-of-a-slave-master-sees-his-players-as-slaves/" target="_blank">told</a> CNN he wished that white NBA players would speak out against Sterling, which is a bit like John Gotti having wished that someone would speak out against racketeering. And Barack Obama took time away from destroying our world standing, healthcare system, social policy and economy to say that “comments reportedly made by Sterling are ‘incredibly offensive racist statements,’ before casting them as part of a continuing legacy of slavery and segregation that Americans must confront,” <a href="http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/04/29/spike-lee-sterling-has-mentality-of-a-slave-master-sees-his-players-as-slaves/" target="_blank">wrote</a> CBS DC. He then opined, “When ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance, you don’t really have to do anything; you just let them talk” (you don’t have to do anything except, I suppose, “confront” a “legacy of slavery and segregation”). But, okay, I’ll just let Obama talk.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Now, opportunism is often a factor in such hypocrisy, but there is something else: a striking sense of entitlement. This is why many black people will condemn a white person for making a bigoted comment with an equally bigoted comment without batting an eye; when whites are bigoted, it’s “racist”; when blacks are, it’s something else. And, in fact, this idea is encapsulated in the definition of “racism” I alluded to earlier. It’s one you’ve probably heard:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Only whites can be “racist” because a prerequisite for “racism” is not only bigoted intent, but the power to act upon it.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And, actually, they’ll get no argument from me. As I’ve said before, the left originated the word “racism,” so they may define it. They may have it.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And if they ask, I’ll tell them where they can stick it.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The problem is that conservatives, being conservative — meaning, conserving yesterday’s liberals’ social victories — parrot the word. It’s another example of how, forgetting that the side defining the vocabulary of a debate, wins the debate, conservatives slavishly use the Lexicon of the Left.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, eventually this will all be left in the dustbin of history. Movements, peoples and civilizations come and go, and we’ll get over our fixation with one part of one-seventh of the Deadly Sins. And then man will swing to another extreme, as he goes on to the next great mistake.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">Few would expect a survivor of the Holocaust to be the face of genocide denial. Imagine the surprise of Suffolk Law School’s student body when its administration’s chosen commencement speaker turned out to be just that.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Abraham Foxman, the long-time director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an organization dedicated to eradicating anti-Semitism and bigotry and protecting civil rights, seems a figure beyond reproach. Yet Foxman has invited controversy to Suffolk University for his unwillingness to recognize the 1915 Armenian Genocide &#8211; an event which saw an estimated 1.5 million Armenians massacred by the Turks &#8211; and his campaign to defeat Congressional acknowledgement of said genocide.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Criticism of Foxman has centered on this disconnect, that a man who lived through the attempted extermination of an entire race now denies that truth of another. Many at Suffolk are unwilling to participate in that hypocrisy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b>Suffolk’s Students Speak Out</b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Shortly after Foxman was announced as their 2014 speaker, Suffolk Law students <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2014%2F04%2F21%2Fsome-suffolk-students-criticize-choice-adl-leader-abraham-foxman-law-school-commencement-speaker%2FAEvvrb6dYabiYNOliYmZiN%2Fstory.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF4FNY3H8izw16kHqjimxPNPJ6hmA" target="_blank">rejected the decision</a>. Amy Willis, President of the university’s National Lawyers Guild chapter, told the Boston Globe that “Suffolk claims to embody diversity and be a place for all people, but this clearly is a speaker who does not embody those values.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This stance was reflected in <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.change.org%2Fpetitions%2Fpresident-james-mccarthy-remove-adl-director-abe-foxman-as-suffolk-law-s-2014-commencement-speaker&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGmq997oOF_fGcmbAhi8aPS1llc3w" target="_blank">a petition to remove Foxman</a> as the keynote speaker, as well as to deny him the honorary Juris doctorate he is slated to receive. The petition states that Foxman’s presence “not only insults students and their families, but also insults the very foundation of Suffolk Law as a safe place of diversity and acceptance.” As arguments for his removal, the petition enumerates Foxman’s refusal to explicitly label the Armenian Genocide as a genocide as well as his support for <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Farticles%2F2013%2F04%2F29%2Fabe-foxman-rationalizes-blanket-spying-on-american-muslims.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOUZxFH00m9ddv9zQ7Tv9tl68RcQ" target="_blank">racial profiling of Muslim-Americans</a> in the interest of “national security.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b>What Is Genocide?</b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Raphael Lemkin coined the term “genocide” in 1944 to describe the magnitude of premeditated racial extermination, citing <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCebMq-GmH4" target="_blank">what happened to the Armenians</a> as the prime example. After the war, the United Nations approved the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.genocidescholars.org%2Fresources%2Fabout-genocide&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVTI-pdcJn_c4mcV8BZ3nHJddRuw" target="_blank">establishing genocide as an international crime</a>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In the Convention, genocide is defined as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,” which includes “killing members of the group” and “deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The mention of “intent” is significant in this definition. Foxman’s 2007 statement (described below) would go out of its way to avoid labeling the Turkish pogrom as intentional, admitting only that its “consequences” were “tantamount” to genocide. To the casual observer, it is perhaps a negligible distinction. From a legal standpoint, it is strategically evasive.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b>What Is the Armenian Genocide?</b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This definition applies to the systematic slaughter of Armenians by the Turkish government that began in 1915. To understand how this genocide came to be, a brief summary of the two nations’ history is required.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Existing in various forms for approximately 3,000 years of recorded history, Armenia was the first nation to declare Christianity its national religion. It remained Christian under the several empires that conquered it, including the Muslim caliphate of the Ottoman Turks. From the 15th century onward, Armenians and their fellow “infidels” were allowed to continue their religious practices, though subjected to higher taxes, fewer rights and ethnic discrimination. For the Armenians, this culminated in the Hamidian Massacres of 1894-1897. This state-sponsored pogrom was instituted by Sultan Abdul Hamid II in retaliation for Armenians’ attempts to win civil rights.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">By the start of World War I, political tensions between Armenians and a new Turkish government were even more strained. Armenia itself had been divided by warring empires, with Russia claiming the east and Turkey claiming the west. Duty-bound, both sides fought for their respective empires.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This dichotomy of loyalty enabled the Turks to concoct a pretext that veiled their ultimate goal of an ethnically and religiously uniform empire. A purge would enable them to <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.armenian-genocide.org%2Fchronology.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF_noTfzxOnV1l2a2NixiNCXCP-gg" target="_blank">“liquidate”</a> the “Christian element” and seize the wealth and property of suspected insurgents. On April 24, 1915, the Turkish government authorized the arrest and execution of several hundred Armenian intellectuals. From that point, the executions would continue for eight years, shrouded under the fog of the Great War.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Turkish soldiers and mercenaries acting under the general outfit of “Special Operations” murdered hundreds of thousands of Armenians, Assyrians and Greeks, marching them through the Anatolian and Syrian deserts without food, water or clothing. “Infidels” not sentenced to hard labor camps were drowned in rivers, thrown off cliffs, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.genocide-museum.am%2Feng%2Fonline_exhibition_6.php&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH7z9EthV9wnjxIb8g4zVa4FHOazw" target="_blank">crucified</a> and burned alive. Property was seized, women were raped and dispatched to Turkish harems, and many children were kidnapped and forcibly converted to Islam.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The number of survivors is a matter of debate, but of a population of 2 million indigenous Armenians, it is estimated that upwards of 1.5 million were slaughtered in Turkey between 1915 and 1923. Even today, almost a century later, the Euphrates River is filled with the bones of dead Armenians, as author Peter Balakian, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2008%2F12%2F07%2Fmagazine%2F07lives-t.html%3F_r%3D0&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqWmK3E0TiLrjQq33rjHRbRcM52g" target="_blank">writing for the New York Times magazine</a>, can attest.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Stark, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.armenian-genocide.org%2Fphoto_wegner_view.html%3Fphoto%3Ddoorstep.jpg%26collection%3Dwegner%26caption%3DYoung%2Bboy%2Bdies%2Bon%2Bdoorstep&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG_zNaUR5b7FI-XKNZT6xta7ikq2w" target="_blank">horrific images</a> exist to document the savagery of the Armenian massacre. Yet still Turkey denies its own legacy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b>Turkey and Foxman’s Denials</b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Article 301 of the Turkish penal code <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldpoliticsreview.com%2Farticles%2F517%2Fhrant-dink-silenced-in-the-shadow-of-turkeys-penal-code-301&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGBpkWpxHc3GNFaEhBBBrdio_GQSw" target="_blank">makes it illegal</a> to insult Turkey, the Turkish nation or the Turkish government. To acknowledge an “Armenian Genocide” is the most egregious insult possible.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Because Turkey was the first nation in the Middle East to establish diplomatic relations with Israel and remains an instrumental ally of the West, the United States is unwilling to rock that political boat. Even when a resolution was proposed by the 110th Congress to recognize the Armenian Genocide, then President George W. Bush publicly opposed the measure. He was not the first, and current President Barack Obama’s silence on the issue suggests he will not be the last.</p>
<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/zflmBNjHfAM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And this has been <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.salon.com%2F2010%2F06%2F16%2Fisrael_lobby_genocide_armenia%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHVOK4suS51HRJvpk02rNhAFsRgrw" target="_blank">Abraham Foxman’s dilemma</a>. His public opposition to Armenian recognition has been out of loyalty to Israel. “Our focus is Israel,” he has said. “If helping Turkey helps Israel, then that’s what we’re in the business of doing.” It seems absurd to the point of tragedy that a man who lived under Nazi oppression can answer the question of Armenian genocide with, “It was wartime. Things get messy.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But in 2007, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.boston.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Farticles%2F2007%2F08%2F22%2Fadl_chief_bows_to_critics%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFBW_ewx184FxE85usCF-thG7iELg" target="_blank">Foxman tried to pacify his critics</a>. Speaking for himself and the ADL, he stated that, “We have never negated but have always described the painful events of 1915-1918 perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire against Armenians as massacres and atrocities,” ending with decision that “the consequences of those actions were indeed tantamount to genocide.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But “tantamount to genocide” without intent is not genocide. This calculated elision of “intent,” its palpable absence, is an insult to the Armenian community. The ADL’s defenders decry this as splitting hairs, but they overlook the importance of legacy and how powerfully a single word can affect it. It was important enough to prompt a dozen Massachusetts cities to pull out of the ADL’s “No Place for Hate” anti-bias program. It was important enough that when Andrew H. Tarsy, a regional director for the ADL, acknowledged the genocide <i>as </i>true genocide, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.boston.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Farticles%2F2007%2F08%2F18%2Fadl_local_leader_fired_on_armenian_issue%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHiHHlBKEfC2WPMkdffAxm1xlhjmg" target="_blank">he was promptly fired from the organization</a>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Unfortunately for Suffolk Law School, and all those who expect the ADL to uphold its own morality, Abraham Foxman represents a willful blindness &#8211; to look the other way on a hundred-year-old crime &#8211; for the sake of political expediency.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It is the opinion of Suffolk University President James McCarthy that Foxman, despite students’ protests, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fforward.com%2Farticles%2F196952%2Fabraham-foxman-to-speak-at-boston-graduation-despi%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFKRjljLhySVUhafaMD46QWYAGqWg" target="_blank">“is well deserving of recognition.”</a> Moreover, it is the University’s hope that Foxman’s “life of public service will inspire our graduates as they embark on their professional careers.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This does beg the question of what recognition the Syrian desert’s uncounted dead deserve, or what their lives may have inspired, but the answers are unlikely to be found in Foxman’s commencement speech.</p>

<p><i>Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.</i> ~ Eph 5:11</p>
<p>Not surprisingly the movie “Son of God” has created quite a stir in the Christian community.  Before I gave the theater my money I read several reviews, blog posts, Facebook comments and viewed TV interviews of husband and wife team Mark Burnett and Roma Downey promoting their film.  Roma is a familiar face to many and is best-known for her role on the successful TV show “Touched by An Angel.”  Mark Burnett is the executive producer of a string of hit TV shows such as &#8220;Survivor,&#8221; &#8220;The Voice, “Celebrity Apprentice,&#8221; &#8220;Shark Tank,&#8221; and he has won several Emmys.</p>
<p>When I first heard that another full-length feature film about the life of Christ was coming to the silver screen, I was skeptical for several reasons.  First, Mark and Roma are <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fproclaimingthegospel.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFC3frvRKIQF9SC4yqvYBlZF-DJFw" target="_blank">Catholic</a> and I was concerned that the movie would be produced from this perspective; a perspective that in many cases I disagree with.</p>
<p>Second, I learned that Roma earned a degree in “spiritual psychology” from the University of Santa Monica, a private graduate school founded by New Age spiritual and self-help quack John-Roger.   P.J. Miller is not being flippant when he asks:</p>
<p><i>What do you call someone who is a student of new age psychology and spiritualism? Do you call them new agers? Do you call them seekers? Would you dare call them Christian? Well, if you’re Roma Downey, then yes, you would call yourself all the above. (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpjmiller.wordpress.com%2F2014%2F02%2F20%2Froma-downey-and-mark-burnetts-son-of-god-film%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFgZWzUvSSuonF-KhRyFE76zVKmtg" target="_blank">Source</a>)</i></p>
<p>Third, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcIXCok9HPg" target="_blank">movie trailer</a> shows Jesus asking Peter to follow Him. Peter looks skeptical and asks Jesus what they’re going to do.  Jesus grins and replies “Change the world.&#8221;  Well, no.  Jesus never said those words to Peter!  Here’s what Jesus actually said:</p>
<p><i>While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.</i><i> And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”<sup><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></sup>Immediately they left their nets and followed him. </i>(Mat 4:18-20)</p>
<p>Jesus <i>commanded</i>  &#8211; Peter and Andrew dropped what they were doing to follow Him.  (More on this in a moment.)  Another clip shows a woman sitting in a boat on the Sea of Galilee with Jesus and the apostles during the storm where Jesus walks on water.  But according to Scripture there was no woman in the boat:</p>
<p><i>Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.  </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fmatthew%2F14.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFQMifrWgBs3o8e0MX5YlB1nLJO6g" target="_blank">Mat 14:22</a>) <i></i></p>
<p>In the movie Mary was the woman in the boat.  But why would they have a woman in the boat when Matthew informs us that the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gotquestions.org%2Ftwelve-apostles-disciples-12.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFHKds39cg97GDWLIkhPjBmgEvhiw" target="_blank">disciples/apostles</a> got into the boat.  Mary wasn’t one of the twelve disciples/apostles – no woman was!</p>
<p>Finally, S. Michael Houdmann revealed in his review of the movie that, “the reason for Jesus&#8217; death and the meaning of His resurrection are completely missing. The fact that Jesus&#8217; death is the atoning sacrifice for sin is not mentioned at all (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblia.com%2Fbible%2Fesv%2F1%2520John%25202.2&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG905IHhqX4ANXW8h2rFEl3ybcB-A" target="_blank">1 John 2:2</a>).”</p>
<p>As I said, “Son of God” has elicited a great deal of controversy as did Mark and Roma’s “<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.history.com%2Fshows%2Fthe-bible%2Fvideos%3Fmkwid%3DsSPL82MEx%257Cc_pcrid_38422039518_pkw_the%2520bible%2520miniseries_pmt_b%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_term%3Dthe%2520bible%2520miniseries%26utm_campaign%3DG_The%2BBible%26paidlink%3D1%26cmpid%3DPaidSearch_google_G_The%2BBible_&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFELoDt1jPlNQ5AsvmarGeUJWHSSA" target="_blank">The Bible</a>” miniseries produced by <i>LightWorkers Media</i>, a company owned by them.

<p><b>The Son of God?</b></p>
<p>“Son of God” opened on February 28, so by now a lot of folks have had the opportunity to view it in theatres and many more will have it streaming into their living rooms in a few months.  Naturally, reviews were quickly written, some good, some not so good.  (You’ll find links to the reviews at the end of this piece.) Suffice to say that in a short amount of time a lot has been said about the film.</p>
<p>Many of you won’t be surprised to learn that Mark and Roma asked Saddleback Church founder Rick Warren to help spread their version of the “good news.”   He happily agreed.  “I&#8217;ve seen most of the films produced about Jesus in the past 50 years,” said the pastor, “and ‘Son of God’ is the best.  We&#8217;re excited Jesus is back on the big screen, and we&#8217;re going to fill the theaters. I want every other faith leader in America to do the same.”</p>
<p>So – why would the man who is affectionately called “America’s Pastor” agree to promote a film that its critics describe as outright unbiblical?</p>
<p>Not only did Warren endorse the film, according to the <em>Baptist Standard</em> staff report :</p>
<p>Pastor and author Rick Warren partnered with LifeWay Christian Resources to release a Bible study related to the <em>Son of God</em> movie from 20th Century Fox, which hits theaters Feb. 28.</p>
<p>The small-group curriculum resource by Warren, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifeway.com%2FProduct%2Fson-of-god-the-life-of-jesus-in-you-leader-kit-p005683781&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcgHScltwfKoVSrmkrNSALmULXSA" target="_blank"><em>Son of God: The Life of Jesus in You</em></a>, is a companion piece to the movie produced by husband-and-wife team Mark Burnett and Roma Downey.</p>
<p>The six-session study features video clips from the movie and videos from Warren explaining Jesus’ teachings and their impact on people’s lives. Topics include baptism, temptation, suffering, death, resurrection and ministry. (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.baptiststandard.com%2Fnews%2Fbaptist%2F16135-baptist-briefs-son-of-god-film-study-materials&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFe5Hn8F-yRqcWl1o5LUyhycE_kmA" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>As a Southern Baptist preacher, Rick Warren knows perfectly well that the Roman Catholic Church holds to the view that it is the one true Church.  Thus, any church outside the RCC is anathematized (excommunicated, cursed or damned). The Protestant Reformers held the view that the RCC’s gospel is not a gospel that saves; therefore the RCC is apostate.  Anyone who rejects the true gospel – we are saved by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone – is an unbeliever.  Period.  Warren also knows what the Bible teaches regarding believers going into <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F110124&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHiF_q_2AwTLQ4sDLs1yW7u9WlT7Q" target="_blank">partnerships with unbelievers</a>:</p>
<p><i>Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness.</i> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F2_corinthians%2F6.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMAY0VmYFOOkoqEQo2lwys2YH5dQ" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>)</p>
<p>Here’s the thing.  Not everyone who professes the name of Christ has a true saving faith.  What about Mark Burnett and Roma Downey?  Do they have a true saving faith?  Let’s examine the fruit.</p>
<p><b>Endorsements</b></p>
<p>Popular pastor and author Mark Driscoll’s church bought out 3,500 seats.  In 2013 he and his wife shared a stage with Mark and Roma at Resurgence 13.  Driscoll later remarked:</p>
<p><i>We watched the world premier trailer for</i><em> </em><i><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonofgodmovie.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-fkG9dZ52XXs5GpGYJ54MvuRECQ" target="_blank">The Son of God</a> at the conference, and the footage choked me up as I thought of the millions of people who will hear about Jesus through this project. I am so encouraged by God’s work through this couple. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftheresurgence.com%2F2013%2F11%2F07%2Fson-of-god-mark-burnett-roma-downey-at-r13&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5IaLbzfvROoRWgJK81bKNGWfuYA" target="_blank">Source</a>)<i></i></p>
<p>God’s work?</p>
<p><i>The connection between the Passover sacrifice (Exodus 12) and Jesus as the Lamb of God (</i><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblia.com%2Fbible%2Fesv%2FJohn%25201.29&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNETeolXbTfLhDRdYfRa0yM6E5HHPQ" target="_blank"><i>John 1:29</i></a><i>) is not made. The fact that Jesus&#8217; resurrection proves His victory over death and sin and guarantees a resurrected eternal life for all who believe in Him (1 Corinthians 15) is nowhere to be found.  &#8211; </i>S. Michael Houdmann</p>
<p>Another endorser of the film was “Social Justice Christian” Rev. Jim Wallis.  In my column <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F120911&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIE-sMLkZMpVsz_lvVUBF_fHl0fA" target="_blank">Liberalism created the culture of evil and death, part 3</a> I wrote:</p>
<p><i>This man wears many hats.  He is the founder of Sojourner’s Magazine, speaker, author and activist.  He’s also President Obama’s “spiritual advisor.”  This alone speaks volumes.  Rev. Wallis insists that he’s an evangelical Christian even though he has abandoned the biblical gospel for the “social gospel.”  He believes he’s on a mission from God to assist the poor and oppressed to bring forth the Kingdom of God on earth. </i></p>
<p>When this purveyor of the false social justice gospel was asked for advice by the couple, he gladly gave it to them:</p>
<p><i>What won me over to the whole series was the clip about Jesus meeting Peter, the fisherman. In a Washington, D.C., premiere of “The Bible” series a few weeks ago, I had wonderful conversations with Mark and Roma. Mark asked me if they were right to have Jesus say that he wanted to change the world. Those words are not literally in the scriptures, but it seemed to him and Roma that’s exactly what Jesus was talking about. Absolutely correct, I told them both. And we went through the first few chapters of Mathew which demonstrate that truth. I love the clarity and courage of the statement from Jesus in “The Bible.”</i></p>
<p>Sunny Shell disagrees:</p>
<p><i>Christ came into the world to save sinners from the righteous wrath of God, which is the just penalty for our sins. He never said He came to change the world. He said He came to transform people by giving them new hearts and new minds through repentance and faith in Christ alone. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunnyshell.org%2F2014%2F02%2Fmovie-review-son-of-god-is-most.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF602M-mwbXh5wlSVWozEG6U1sNzQ" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>The <i>Examiner</i> listed the names of churches and organizations that distributed tickets for a so-called &#8220;Theater Take-Over&#8221;:</p>
<p><strong><i>Joel Osteen</i></strong><i>, pastor of Lakewood Church in Houston, Tex., who is distributing 8,000 tickets donated by an anonymous donor; <strong>Jerry Falwell</strong>, Jr., of Liberty University which has more than 12,000 students; <strong>Craig Groeschel</strong> of LifeChurch which has 18 campuses in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma; Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles with over four million members and Miles McPherson of the Rock Church with weekly attendance of more than 10,000 in San Diego, Calif.</i> (Emphasis in original - <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.examiner.com%2Farticle%2Frick-warren-son-of-god-best-movie-of-jesus-50-years&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFU_NyUVASLjKJekDa5tfeSfhWwKw" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>
<p>In an article that appeared on <i>Fox News</i>, Mark and Roma wrote:</p>
<p><i>In all our combined years in the entertainment industry, we’ve never seen anything like this kind of grass-roots support for a project. It is truly miraculous.</i></p>
<p><i>So, too, is the unprecedented depth and breadth of those who have endorsed the film. Pastors like Rick, as well as scholars and faith organizations, have graciously supported our effort to share this story of our Savior – though they belong to different denominations, adhere to varying theological doctrine, worship God in their own unique ways. </i></p>
<p><i>Bishop T.D. Jakes of The Potter’s House in Dallas said “the audience will be enthralled, encouraged and inspired.” </i></p>
<p>S. Michael Houdmann was not enthralled by the movie.  In his review he writes:</p>
<p><i>The Son of God presents a Jewish Messiah who is crucified, dies, comes back to life, and commissions His followers to spread the word. But why did He have to die? What is the meaning of the resurrection? What is the message the apostles were supposed to proclaim, and why was it worth dying for? <b></b></i></p>
<p>More from the <i>Fox News</i> article…</p>
<p><i>Joel Osteen of Lakewood Church in Houston called it “an epic work that touches the heart.”</i></p>
<p><i>The Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles Jose Gomez says it’s “a very important movie because it gives us the opportunity to realize God’s presence in our own lives.”</i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fopinion%2F2014%2F02%2F27%2Fson-god-miraculous-journey-to-big-screen%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-smuaswla4b1ygxCikRAo3i46Xw" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Certainly there are by now “Church leaders” that are sincerely shocked to find out that they endorsed a movie produced by New Age Catholics.  Here’s more proof from a 2010 article <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbecksmithhollywood.com%2F2009%2F04%2Froma-downey-happy-out-of-spotlight%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_oBUaRK962PgJULO81uMLpLoLuw" target="_blank">Roma Downey Happy Out of the Spotlight</a> that shows she’s an advocate of New Age/New Thought spirituality:</p>
<p><i>Says Roma, who lives in Malibu, ‘My kids go to school about a 40-minute drive away. I’m open to the group’s opinion about what we listen to on the way there. On the way back, I get my own selections — books on tape by Eckhart Tolle, Tony Robbins…My husband says I’m so self-realized I’m practically levitating.’</i></p>
<p>For those who are unfamiliar with Eckhart Tolle, he’s a New Ager.  A few years ago Tolle paired up with <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F120507&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNExBXarCqOHwN2-lSGzbTk6euqV8A" target="_blank">Oprah Winfrey</a> to do 10 online classes on XM Satellite radio on his blockbuster book “A New Earth: Are You Ready to Be Awakened.”  Oprah and Tolle took participants through his book chapter by chapter.  Regrettably, a large number of professing Christians took the class!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christiananswersforthenewage.org%2FArticles_HumanPotential1.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG-F3ncTQ4AYRlwb3R9_5522XPqIg" target="_blank">Human Potential</a> guru and &#8220;coach for success” Anthony Robbins once said: &#8220;My definition of success is to live your life in a way that causes you to feel tons of pleasure and very little pain.&#8221;  Evidently no pain is experienced after completing a barefoot firewalk, a self-empower technique Robbins’ teaches to get an otherwise sane person to walk on a bed of burning hot coals during his “Unleash The Power Within” seminar.  On this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od-bcLqelnY#t=11" target="_blank">video</a> you’ll hear the sound of drums beating and the crowd chanting “YES! YES! YES!” as Robbinswhips them into a frenzy in preparation for the firewalk.</p>
<p>More…</p>
<p>Roma appeared on “psychic medium” <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F080328&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFoEPHJhGb6qyChcEUmyIZoszlzew" target="_blank">John Edward’s</a> TV show and allegedly spoke to her deceased mother.  What does the Bible have to say about consulting a medium?</p>
<p><i>And he burned his son as an offering and used fortune-telling and omens and dealt with mediums and with necromancers. He did much evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking him to anger.</i> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F2_kings%2F21.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEbHPjPuA6cdkYAYbK5InRfolex4Q" target="_blank">2 Kings 21:6</a>)</p>
<p>Well, it’s apparent that Roma, who says she loves the Bible, is unaware—or doesn’t care&#8211;that God says consulting a medium is evil.</p>
<p>Later she collaborated with Edwards by providing a CD to accompany a book he wrote:</p>
<p><i>Roma prays the entire rosary</i><i> on the beautiful CD that comes along with this book. It’s quite lovely and gives you the special opportunity and a unique spiritual closeness to Roma to be able to pray right along with her as if she was right there at your side.”</i> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdavemosher.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F03%2F06%2Froma-downeys-comments-and-connections-with-psychic-medium-john-edward-show-she-is-not-a-christian-as-she-claims-but-a-new-ager%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFvRX_2PmQgJ6HjxzeL4MTWIkJ4Q" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>So now you know a bit about two New Age gurus Roma Downey looks forward to listening to each day and an occultist she collaborated with.  The worldview of these men is as far from Christianity as the Earth is from Pluto.</p>
<p>P.J. Miller sat listening to Jim Bakker introduce Mark and Roma on Bakker’s TV show and recalled “their previous work on the History Channel’s The Bible and how they managed to literally re-write the Bible itself, and presented another gospel message altogether. I was captured by their … aggressive but subtle attempt to portray themselves as ‘believers’.  The sappy spiritual love fest that permeated on set showed me that something was indeed changing within Christianity, and that something was another Jesus being introduced to the masses.”</p>
<p><i>Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe it.</i><i> For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fmatthew%2F24.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGAUYRr8l_vl0ukuYfMAByj5ZPIRw" target="_blank">Mat/ 24: 23-24</a>)</p>
<p>After several weeks of due diligence I’ve decided that “Son of God” is not a film I wish to see.  In addition to the concerns I have included in this article, my research has turned up many more &#8212; way too many to incorporate here.  Most troubling is the astonishing lack of discernment shown by some of our so-called Christian leaders.  The Son of God I serve is best described in the Bible which is the inerrant, infallible, inspired Word of God.  Inspired means that God moved through the writers to convey to those who read it the words He wanted us to hear.  So to change the words that Christ spoke is prideful and wicked.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that those who are unfamiliar with the biblical Jesus and see this film will not come away with a clear understanding of His mission here on Earth.</p>
<p><i>He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F1_john%2F2.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFadypSTjyThkBi-zCJpgrDYPqWQg" target="_blank">1John 2:2</a>)<i></i></p>

<p>A book review: Who Lost America by Bromwell Ault&#8230;</p>
<p>Part 1: How Americans lost their country like having the rug of their republic pulled right out from under them.</p>
<p>“The Americans cannot even conduct a military operation there,” said General Salami of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. “The conditions and the factors that facilitate the exercise of military power for them have for years been destroyed and today they (the Americans) are in an erosion of political, cultural, financial and military power.”</p>
<p>Military leaders in the Middle East know more about America’s weaknesses than we citizens understand about ourselves.  We know we cannot trust anything the president or military tell us that happens in Iraq or Afghanistan. The same thing happened with Vietnam.</p>
<ul>
<li>Politically—after five years, our president staggers knee deep in quicksand while our U.S. Congress bogs down in muck so deep it can’t extricate itself to take meaningful or logical action.</li>
<li>Culturally—we don’t know if we represent American citizens or illegal alien migrants or the America Way or Iranian-Americans or Coke’s Super Bowl version of our multicultural and multi-lingual morphing into a Muslim nation represented by an Islamic American female covered in a burka to turn her into a non-being.</li>
<li>Financially—we drown in an $18 trillion national debt with no escape. Our third president, John Adams said, “There two ways to conquer a country: by the sword and by debt.”</li>
<li>Military Power—We spent trillions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan with absolutely nothing to show for it but slaughter for our kids and untold PTSD chaos in our young soldiers that will linger for their lifetimes.  We couldn’t defeat a goat-herder nation like Afghanistan for the past 11 years and counting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the Iranian general’s understanding of our predicament, Americans in the past 45 years relinquished the American Way to the new Multicultural Way that forces us into hyphenated-Americans, confusing languages and lack of the cohesiveness of what an American stood for in this world.</p>
<p>We’ve become a “schizophrenic or multiple-personality- disorder” country via our immigration system that pumped 100 million immigrants from all over the planet into American from 1965 to 2013 with another 100 million projected to arrive from 150 countries within the next 36 years.</p>
<p>As the Super Bowl Coke advertisement illustrated, we don’t know what we stand for as a culture, language or country.  While the Islamic girl wore a headscarf, you see tens of thousands of Muslim women in Detroit, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Denver and Chicago wearing black burkas with only slits for their eyes to see out.  They remain non-beings with no identity within America.  Their Muslim husbands subjugate them with fear and cultural dominance.  Yet, they represent the beachhead for Islamic conquest in America in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.   At 7 million Muslims in 2014, we must brace ourselves for their aggressive actions when they reach 20 million within two decades and 50 million soon after.</p>
<p>With one look at the Muslim conquest of Europe, an idiot can see Islam’s march, but we think ourselves immune.  Such denial placed the United Kingdom, Norway, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Spain and Sweden reeling from the havoc created by Islamic immigrants.  Lesson: Muslims never integrate into host countries. They create enclaves, which force those countries to tolerate and even adopt Sharia Law, which proves the most barbaric form of subjugation by any religion on the planet.</p>
<p>“Immigrants devoted to their own cultures and religions are not influenced by the secular politically correct façade that dominates academia, news-media, entertainment, education, religious and political thinking today,” said James Walsh, former Associate General Counsel of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service. “They claim the right not to assimilate, and the day is coming when the question will be how can the United States regulate the defiantly unassimilated cultures, religions and mores of foreign lands?  Such immigrants say their traditions trump the U.S. legal system.  Balkanization of the United States has begun.”</p>
<p>Whether you stand as a liberal, conservative, libertarian or not-involved in our country’s future by your apathy—this multicultural train speeds into America with a load of cargo 100 million immigrants full, that no one understands—thus we face consequences of an overpopulated, fractured and fragmented culture society.  And ultimately our civilization splinters and degrades.</p>
<p>Brilliant historian Bromwell Ault, at 84, and a graduate of Yale University, brings the brunt of what Americans face in his new book:  <b>Who Lost America?  <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.centerforpublicconscience.org&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHvQm4lfbPSHH2tOhOCqDlrvVo1mg" target="_blank">www.<wbr></wbr>centerforpublicconscience.org</a></b></p>
<p>He writes, “Can America’s democratic identity and government survive our ethical, political and economic failures?”</p>
<p>Ault begins, “During the State of the Union speech, the President declares that the “State of the Union is strong.”  This has become a tradition and touches upon several emotions and strength; and it creates a sense of unity that binds us to each other and to our past. The problem is that it is a lie centered on its two key words—“union” and “strong”.</p>
<p>Via his extraordinary longevity in America’s story, Ault said, “Technology and progress have a way of overwhelming cultures that are not spiritually, geographically, economically or politically resistant. And it is the ever shifting mix of these elements which determines whether different cultures will succumb or survive.”</p>
<p>With an added 100 million legal immigrants from 150 countries from around the world about to be injected into the United States in the next three decades, can we survive the clash of civilizations they represent?</p>
<p>Samuel P. Huntington, The Clash of Civilizations said, “It is my hypothesis that the fundamental source of conflict in this new world will not be primarily ideological or primarily economic. The great divisions among humankind and the dominating source of conflict will be cultural. Nation-states will remain the most powerful actors in world affairs, but the principal conflicts of global politics will occur between nations and groups of different civilizations. The clash of civilizations will dominate global politics. The fault lines between civilizations will be the battle lines of the future.”</p>
<p>Ault stated the most obvious aspect of an “intact” civilization depended on its culture.  With America scattering into hundreds of cultures within the next three decades, the question arises: can it survive its own lack of a single cohesive culture and people?  Huntington’s research as well as Ault’s shows that the United States will not survive as a single united people or culture.</p>
<p>Ault asks, “Who lost America? Or, more specifically, who replaced the America we were, with what we have become? And, why? And, how?”</p>
<p>Part 2: How we lost the rule of law.  Institutional failure. Transforming and devolving America via the culprits doing the dirty work.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Urban War Zones are now a reality inside many American cities.</strong></p>
<p>It’s no longer necessary to go to Iraq, Afghanistan or Africa to enter a real war zone and have to fight for your life.</p>
<p>Thanks to massive CIA drug trafficking and American Free-trade Treaties like NAFTA, CAFTA, GATT &amp; WTO, many American inner cities have been transformed into actual war zones.</p>
<p><strong>These inner city war zones are infested with drug gangs that outnumber police and out gun them too.</strong></p>
<p>At present these gangs are typically competing and battling with each other for turf and making a living selling drugs and running prostitutes, some captive sex-slaves. At some point if the economy worsens and the SHTF, they could easily start looting and attacking anyone and everyone.</p>
<blockquote><p>However, in every major city in America at present, violent urban predators prey on the unarmed, old, weak, sick or disabled. And while out of control Police Swat Teams battle these predators and drug gangs, they often tyrannize the innocent which include women and young children, using excessive force all too often. There are numerous incidents of such teams murdering innocents after attacking the wrong home.</p></blockquote>
<p>The massive War on Drugs was designed as a dualistic program. One hand, the top secret part involves the USG bringing in massive amounts of illegal drugs to raise “off the books money” for covert ops. The other hand uses all serious gang crimes arising as a pretext to militarize the police as justify their deployment as Nazi Storm Troopers.</p>
<p>This second part of the War on Drugs is for public disclosure and consumption. In response to all this massive urban breakdown, the worsening economy and increasing government tyranny from the Department of Homeland Security, the TSA and out of control local police, Americans are arming at an astounding rate. Guns are literally flying off the shelves and ammo sales are at an all time high also.</p>
<p><strong>Americans now arming up in mass </strong>in order  to protect themselves from and this increasing USG Tyranny of the USG, DHS and their local militarized and Mind-kontrolled local police (1)  and from increasing and spreading urban crime which includes robberies, car-jackings, home burglaries and home invasions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Also given as an important reason for arming up for the first time when asked, is a fear of possible impending economic collapse with an associated SHTF occurrence. Many express a salient and absolute need to be able to protect themselves and/or their family members from possible looters and armed home invaders which would likely accompany a SHTF urban breakdown situation.</p></blockquote>
<p>And who should be credited with creating such a foreboding urban environment? It is the Globalist Traitors and infil-Traitors who have hijacked the political process and Banking in America.</p>
<p><strong>These Globalist “enemies within”</strong> have rammed through economically disastrous Free-Trade Agreements and forced Diversity, Perversions and Political correctness accompanied by massive immigration, most illegal. All this has been designed to destroy the borders, language and culture of America, to neutralize its Constitution, Bill of Rights and Rule of Law while transforming America into a economically distressed Third World Nation.</p>
<p>These Globalist enemies within the Gates have been working very hard to transform America into a Democracy (Mob rule by the masses) from the Republic which was set up by our Founding Fathers.  Obviously any real enforcement of the US Constitution would assure that American would remain a republic the way it was set up.</p>
<p><strong>Since the imposition of so-called “Free Trade” policies upon the American Republic, urban decay and blight have become epidemic in major American cities.</strong> Many cities have turned into Urban Jungles, where only the strongest survive. In these Urban Jungles, violent gangs prevail and the weak are parasitized and consumed, afraid to go out of their homes, especially after dark.</p>
<p>Take Chicago, which has become a “kill or be kill” free fire Urban War Zone in some of its Urban areas. Chicago is the one of the most gun restricted areas ever, but the only ones that do not carry guns to defend themselves are law abiding citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Gang members have all the guns they want</strong>, supplied by drug gangs and the CIA and BATF.<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gang-wars-at-the-root-of-chicagos-high-murder-rate/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gang-wars-at-the-root-of-chicagos-high-murder-rate/</a></p>
<p>Some of these areas such as Washington DC have been rated as having a 300% chance of being mugged if out after dark in certain areas, which means you could likely be robbed three times in a single block if you have a victim profile (old, young, weak, disabled, female). The real unemployment rate is 37%, despite phony USG that it is 7% or less.(2)</p>
<p><strong>And now Detroit has been declared Bankrupt. </strong>It has been reported that retired police and City workers will now receive approximately 13% of their pensions due.</p>
<p>The Ruins of Detroit:</p>

<p>The ten Most Dangerous American Cities which are truly Urban Jungles at Night:</p>

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/aTES9UzRT-Q?feature=player_embedded" height="360" width="540" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
</div>
<p>There are areas in Detroit, South Chicago and St. Louis that are so violent and infested with violent gangs that even the police refuse to enter unless ordered and then do so with major forces.</p>
<p>Until recently parts of Detroit was so violent that police and ambulances refused to provide service during the night hours and often found abandoned dead bodies (murder victims) days later. Detroit, known as “Iron City”, the jewel of America, used to be prosperous beyond measure based on the manufacture of the world’s finest cars.</p>
<p>Remember what a 1965 Olds Starfire coupe was like, or a mid 60′s Buick Wildcat or Pontiac Bonneville was like.  How about a mid 60′s Chevy with a HP409 engine or a Plymouth Belvedere with a 426 Hemi or 440 Wedge engine?</p>
<p><strong>That all changed in 1971 with the introduction of very extreme anti-pollution “clean air” laws</strong> which reduced automotive engine compression ratios from approximately 10.5 to 8.5, required the installation of retarded, goofy extremely inefficient camshafts.  The result was garbage engines that had little power, consumed huge increases in gasoline and a major shift in chassis quality to near complete crap. At that point American automotive quality was gone and is only starting to come back now forty years later.</p>
<p>This is but one symptom of the covert Globalist engineering of American Society on behalf of the City of London zionist Central Banksters.</p>
<blockquote><p>This of course created a great opportunity for the Japanese Auto manufacturers, secretly owned and controlled by the super-elite American Banking families. When W. Edwards Deming, an astute American engineer approached American Automotive Manufacturers in Detroit and proposed his plan to drastically reduce defects and lemons, he was rebuffed because it was felt his plan was too expensive and too slow.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Deming’s plan required 100% quality checks</strong> and verification of all parts from every supplier instead of the approximately 1% or less sampling. When Deming approached the Japanese, who had already shown a new coming expertise in motorcycles and quality circles in their electronics manufacturing, his program was accepted and implemented.</p>
<p>The rest is history, and after about 15 years, the American Automotive manufacturers have been playing a catch up game ever since for quality with the Japanese Auto manufacturers.</p>
<p><strong>And now the Korean Automotive Manufacturers have hired retired Japanese automotive engineers as consultants</strong> and have adopted many of their same practices and principals to their automotive manufacturing.  The result?</p>
<p>Some Autos manufactured in South Korea have attained the same quality as the Japanese which are considered to currently be the highest quality in the world. As many automotive enthusiasts suggest, if you want the best performance buy German, if you want the highest quality buy Japanese.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is a fair assumption that Globalism and the Free-Trade Agreements it produced, have resulted in the exportation of most American heavy industry, manufacturing and millions of good paying jobs. This alone has seriously harmed the American economy and set America on a path of destruction, starting first with its Urban Centers which have become urban wastelands and jungles, and now progressively spreading to middle class and upper middle class outlying suburbs.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Fair Trade with suitably adjusted reasonable Tariffs </strong>to protect American Jobs are necessary to America’s economic survival and prosperity. Free Trade is not Free at all and is an abomination to the American republic and its Sovereignty.</p>
<p>It is a tool of the Globalists to enhance the earnings of their international offshore Globalist corporations at the expense of the American worker.  It is nothing less than a secret war against America’s Sovereignty and the Republic itself.</p>
<p>The only other globalist tactic to destroy America that approaches its effectiveness are the policies of unrestricted illegal immigration, forced diversity, cultural programming that perversion is good, required perversion programming in the public schools that it is normal, and political correctness.</p>
<p><strong>Obviously these are all Globalist weapons of covert war waged against America</strong> to destroy its borders, language and culture and gut it economically.  These Globalist weapons have been deployed against Americans in order to transform America into a Third World “Democracy” instead of the Republic that it was set up to be by the Founding Fathers.</p>
<p><strong>These Traitors and Infil-Traitors in Congress and the Administration</strong> keep financing and running foreign wars for Israel in order to establish Democracy like they keep claiming we have in America. We have never had a democracy but they have been doing their best to kill the Republic on the behalf of their zionist owners and masters This is of course one of the biggest lies ever told.</p>
<blockquote><p>America has always been a Republic, a democracy is mob rule. Of course bringing in 30-60 million illegal immigrants and millions of legally sanctioned foreign workers has quickly undermined American culture and tradition and established a real base to elect politicians who appeal to the masses. The election of President Obama was the first of such travesties.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Up until recently when American aircraft manufacturers starting buying foreign parts, American aircraft were the best in the world</strong>, especially the military aircraft and fighter/interceptors. Now we have an F-22 with a contaminated O2 system from China that causes some pilots to start passing out and a Boeing Dreamliner with a faulty battery system that was imported.</p>
<p>For years St. Louis has been so poor that some of their police radio don’t work properly and their squad cars are in disrepair. In East Los Angeles, despite how tough and well armed the LA Police Department is, top police officials know that they are completely outgunned by Mexican drug gangs allowed to enter and do business inside America and also provided arms shipped by the CIA and the BATF.</p>
<p><strong>It’s not as if Americans weren’t duly warned</strong> what such Free-Trade Treaties would produce, because Presidential Candidate Ross Perot went public with what was coming.  He described the effects as a “giant sucking sound” for American jobs as they would leave America in droves.</p>
<div>

</div>
<p><strong>But despite Perot’s grave warnings, President George HW Bush signed NAFTA</strong> on Dec. 17, 1992 with full Congressional support. The NAFTA Treaty was ratified after Bill Clinton became President. Soon after the sucking sound started, with shocking support the the US Department of State which provided massive grants to major corporations to move manufacturing to Mexico.  These grants continued at American taxpayer expense under the subsequent Trade Treaties that were subsequently signed and ratified such as CAFTA, GATT, and WTO.</p>
<blockquote><p>Unbeknownst to most Americans, President Obama is now deeply involved in secret negotiations to pass the Trans Pacific Partnership Treaty (TPP) which experts have described as “NAFTA on Steroids”. TPP is far more than just another Free Trade Treaty which continues to lower the value of American wages to the “rock bottom” levels in third world  countries. If signed and ratified by Congress, the TPP would be the complete end to any remaining American Sovereignty.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What established this frenzy for Free-Trade Agreements?</strong> It is now known that The last duly elected President of the United States of America was Ronald Reagan.  It is also known by seasoned intel officers that Ronald Reagan distrusted American Intel in general and especially his Vice President George HW Bush.</p>
<p>In fact it has now been discovered that President Reagan distrusted the CIA and American Intel so much, he set up his “Kitchen Cabinet” and brought in Lee Wanta as his Secret Agent under the Totten Doctrine (3).</p>
<p>George HW Bush was illegally elected later as President, since his father Prescott Bush had signed an Immunity Agreement that no future Bushes (Scherfs) would ever run for office after he was arrested for “aiding the enemy” and his Union Bank assets were seized by FDR during WW2.</p>
<p><strong>It is also known that George HW Bush ran his own private CIA inside the CIA</strong> which served the specific needs of the zionist City of London Central Banksters and their franchisees, the American private Federal Reserve and major Wall Street Banksters.</p>
<p>Some former top American Intel believe that it was this private GHW Bush Intel organization that tried to assassinate President Reagan, by using their man, a secret service man who fired a high speed plastic disc from a compressed air powered disc-gun, the type displayed by William Colby in Congressional Hearings on the abuses of American Intel.</p>
<blockquote><p>PBS Judy Woodruff had reported this of seeing the SS man fire a gun from a second story window that night on PBS but the story was quickly squelched and she changed it after a very convincing “not to worry visit” from some very serious American Intel agents. President Reagan, despite a long slow disjointed route to the hospital, survived. This assassination attempt however signaled that the Treasonous Bush Cabal had attained a major power base inside the Military and Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>The sad thing is that all the political power and influence  necessary to accomplish this and to transform the American Congress into Traitors was due to the vast money provided to K Street Lobbyists and zionist espionage groups like AIPAC, ADL, B’nai B’brith, and the like by the Central Banksters and the various Judaic groups shaken down and manipulated by zionist for donations.</p>
<p>So the first beach-head of the Globalists (aka zionist City of London Central Banksters and the “Old Black Nobility” they represented) was established with a bought, owned and controlled US Congress.  Once GHW Bush was elected President, the circle of control was complete.</p>
<p><strong>One of George W. Bush’s major assignments was to take American further down the Globalist path by fighting more Mideast wars for Israel</strong>. Another was to destroy the Republic party by being the worst President ever and fully debasing the Republican, which he did. Now the Republican leaders in Congress are tricking the Republican Party into committing suicide by agreeing to back the Democratic legislation for making illegal immigrants legal and future citizens.</p>
<blockquote><p>So it is now obvious that the Republic Party is finished and Americans need to rise up and form a new Third Party. Otherwise you can be assured that just like in the last Presidential election, both candidates will be owned by the Bush Cabal.Unless the Bush Cabal has been fully exposed and displaced by then which is now  real possibility.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>It has been estimated that there are now approximately 30 million illegal immigrants inside America</strong>allowed in by a Globalist controlled USG who prevented border enforcement and liberal immigration laws which are not enforced. With the the passage of the currently proposed Democratic plan for legalizing illegal immigrants, this number could easily grow to 60 to 100 million.</p>
<blockquote><p>In most major American Cities, Police are not allowed to arrest suspected illegal immigrants for minor traffic violations or check their identification for legal status. Not so for those whose license plates are run and show up as actual American Citizens. And this is all due to orders coming down from a few top policy-Makers who operate at the nexus of the Secret Shadow Government (SSG).</p></blockquote>
<p>GHWB could now institute major efforts to undo all the excellent plans for the economic and industrial reconstruction of America that President Reagan had set in place and activated. As has been disclosed in a previous article (4), President Reagan had brought in Lee Wanta to serve as his Secret Agent because he didn’t trust the CIA which had been corrupted and hijacked by GHWB.</p>
<p><strong>It should now be exceedingly clear</strong> to those who are well informed about the degradation of the American economy and rule of law accompanied by increasing tyranny, deployment of DHS, TSA and the passage of all the unConstitutional draconian laws (like the so-called Patriot Act, the Military Commissions Act, and NDAA 2014).</p>
<p>All this is being engineered by foreign controlled Globalist traitors and infil-Traitors who have hijacked America and worked hard to export  heavy industry, manufacturing and jobs.</p>
<p>And that they are doing this to asset strip America, destroy it’s economy and the Republic itself in order to Balkanize America and prevent it from ever rising in economic strength again and operating as a Republic “of the people, by the people and for the people”.</p>
<p><strong>Their motives for all this?</strong>  To covertly re-fight the Revolutionary war that was lost and retake America on behalf of the zionist City of London Central Banksters and their Kingpin overlords the Old Black Nobility (OBN).  These hidden masters of the world-wide occult network which runs the IZCS prefer to stay hidden in the background where they can pull all the strings of several top Policy-Makers in America with no personal risk to themselves.</p>
<p><strong>What can be done to turn this around? </strong>Obviously the first step is to get rid of all Free-Trade Agreements. In order to do this all the zionist espionage fronts inside America such as AIPAC, ADL, B’nai B’rith and the like must be fully exposed and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. In order to do this zionist Israeli-American dual citizens inside Congress and the USG and its Agencies must be exposed as traitors and agents of foreign espionage and routed out of power.</p>
<p>America has to stop fighting Israel’s illegal Mideast wars and withdraw all aid and support for Israel as long as it is a criminal, racist apartheid state persecuting and murdering Palestinians and stealing their land incrementally.</p>
<p>Lee Wanta, a great American Heroe that served as President Reagan’s Secret Agent under the Totten Doctrine and was instrumental in bringing down the evil Soviet Union</p>
<p><strong>We need to re-institute the Wanta Reconstructing America Plan</strong> based on the Maglev High Speed Rail System which has the necessary funding already available. (5)</p>
<p>And it is time to also re-establish the Want Economic Recovery Plan for America that was also set up under President Reagan, but later stopped cold by George HW Bush and his Cabal when they instituted a secret coup to take over the whole USG on behalf of the City of London zionist Central Banksters and their Wall Street and Federal Reserve Franchisees.(6)</p>
<p>In fact it is a reasonable assumption that the massive Free-Trade attack on America’s economy was largely a reaction by the Bush Cabal to these amazing economic reconstruction plans President Reagan had put in place through his Secret Agent Lee Wanta, who was the master strategist that took down the Soviet Union for President Reagan.</p>
<p><strong>Recent respected surveys show that a majority of American are disgusted with the current administration</strong> and rating of the lowest ever experienced in America in the last century. Congress is also rated at an all time low with only 9% approving of it. Many view the current President as an alien imposter with no traceable past.  Some alternative media writers have stated that he is a sheep-dipped CIA creation just like Bill Clinton. All this is a mute point.  Why?</p>
<blockquote><p>Because Ronald Reagan was the last duly elected President of the United States of America, the Republic, all presidents since have been fraudulently elected and owned by the Bush Cabal. And this Bush Cabal is the Action Agent of the City of London zionist Central Banksters and their International Zionist Crime Syndicate (IZCS).</p></blockquote>
<p>The IZCS is centered in Israel where most intel is done by privatized Israeli corporations serving as American Defense and Intel contractors.  It is these private Israeli contactors who control all NSA raw intel and almost all American communications including internal White House phone calls and messaging, as well as all Pentagon and DOD communications.</p>
<p><strong>Obviously the Bush Cabal has been able to install its own Presidential puppets</strong> and run a lucrative illegal drug trafficking operations into America.  All done to destabilize and “dirty up” American Cities while absorbing a great deal of the Welfare dollars and capturing vast “off the books” funds for their own covert operations and bribery of Congress. It is a fair conclusion that the Bush Cabal has destroyed the American Rule of Law, debased any true enforcement of the US Constitution and Bill of Rights and has corrupted every institution and agency of the USG.</p>
<p><strong>However there is good news</strong>.  A growing force for good has emerged in the Alternative Media now transmitted everywhere instantly on demand by the worldwide Internet, the new Gutenberg Press and the NWO Globalist’s Achilles Heel. Yes, the Controlled Mass media (CMMM) has been a propaganda mouthpiece for the Bush Cabal and the IZCS, but is now losing its appeal and credibility. The CMMM keeps feeding lies and crap to the American public that are obviously false, like the Mideast American wars are wars to establish Democracy.  More and more Americans now realize this is complete BS, that we are there to fight Israel’s wars and defend British Oil interests.</p>
<blockquote><p>Compare the articles of Veterans Today and other respected truth media now which are being published and read by millions inside America and all over the world with the CMMM. You will see the gap between the alternative media truth and the CMMM lies is ever widening and we are starting to see Alternative Media’s popularity driving stories into the CMMM, even thought the CMMM usually attempts to neutralize their significance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many thousands of brave American Soldiers who were lied to and deceived into fighting these illegal, unConstitutional, unprovoked, undeclared wars for Israel and Big Oil, thinking that they were defending America and its freedom. Few greater lies and deceptions has ever been predicated on Americans than this complete lie.  Many thousands of Americans have been killed and horribly wounded and disabled in this war.</p>
<blockquote><p>If the American Military ever fully realizes that all these wars were phony and based on a lie and that Israel did the 9/11 attacks with the help of a cabal within the USAF and JCS, there will be hell to pay for all those perps involved. And now there is good reason to believe that day is coming in the not too distant future.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>As most Americans are beginning to realize, America has been infil-Traited by Traitors and Infil-Traitors in the highest positions of the USG</strong>.  The major economic deterioration and loss of assets to the Wall Street Banksters and the private Federal reserve through financial Fraud have been staggering and Americans are catching on the the BLATANTLY OBVIOUS.</p>
<p><strong>When American society reaches a critical mass awakening</strong> to this obvious situation that Globalists have been doing everything they can to destroy America, there will be major Blow-back of astounding proportions. When 12% of Americans are awakened, a critical mass and major turning point will be reached and you will begin to see major social change like never conceived, and this will all be due to major Blow-back from awakening.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The elites hate to acknowledge it, but when large numbers of ordinary people are moved to action, it changes the narrow political world where the elites call the shots. Inside accounts reveal the extent to which Johnson and Nixon’s conduct of the Vietnam War was constrained by the huge anti-war movement. It was the civil rights movement, not compelling arguments, that convinced members of Congress to end legal racial discrimination. More recently, the townhall meetings, dominated by people opposed to health care reform, have been a serious roadblock for those pushing reform…. A big turnout … can make a real difference….When someone tells you to stop imagining that you are having an impact, ask them to please direct their energy into getting 10 friends to join you in doing what needs to be done. If it has no impact, you’ll have gone down trying. If it has an impact, nobody will tell you for many years. (7)</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>This coming complete awakening will be due to information dispensed and diffused by the Alternative Media</strong> and the worldwide Internet as well as word of mouth. it is best viewed as a byproduct of a new and powerful emerging worldwide populism which has now reached the point it is unstoppable. One recent study has established 10% as a critical mass, turning point for Society.(8)</p>
<p>I believe we are already at 11% and when we reach 12%, the days of the Bush cabal will be dated. They know it too and are scared sh*tless. That is why they have been going for broke trying to ram the NWO down our throats and militarize local police and build up DHS to oppress and then mass murder us.</p>
<p><strong>It’s time to speak up to all your family, friends and associates</strong> that we need to abandon the Republican and Democratic political Parties.  Both parties are owned and controlled by the same Overlord, the IZCS who bought them and can blackmail them with NSA provided intel.</p>
<p>Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, who is also a Vet and a Navy Seal/UDT man had it right in his book of the Replican and Democrat Political Gangs in America, DemoCRIPS and ReBLOODlicans (9).</p>
<p>Gov. Ventura recommends Americans dump both political Parties which serve the same corrupt masters and start electing alternative candidates only who are not associated with either of the two parties.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p><strong>It should now be exceedingly clear to those who are well informed about the degradation of the American economy and rule of law</strong> accompanied by increasing tyranny, deployment of DHS, TSA and the passage of all the unConstitutional draconian laws (like the so-called Patriot Act, the Military Commissions Act, and NDAA 2014), that all this is being engineered by foreign controlled Globalist traitors and infil-Traitors who have hijacked America and worked hard to export  heavy industry, manufacturing and jobs.</p>
<p>And that they are doing this to asset strip America, destroy it’s economy and the Republic itself in order to Balkanize America and prevent it from ever rising in economic strength again and operating as a Republic “of the people, by the people and for the people”.</p>
<p><strong>Their motives for all this?</strong>  To covertly re-fight the Revolutionary war that was lost and retake America on behalf of the zionist City of London Central Banksters and their Kingpin overlords the Old Black Nobility (OBN).  These hidden masters of the world-wide occult network which runs the IZCS prefer to stay hidden in the background where they can pull all the strings of several top Policy-Makers in America with no personal risk to themselves.</p>

<p align="left">he media spin machine is again kicking into high gear, perfectly timed to accompany the &#8220;Geneva II&#8221; Syria peace talks. The lies are necessary to give the Obama administration an upper hand in the peace negotiations, which are not being used to pursue peace, but instead, to accomplish the Obama administration’s longstanding goal of Syrian regime change. Here are the top three Western media lies about the Syrian peace talks.</p>
<p align="left">1) The removal of Syrian Bashar al-Assad was an agreed upon &#8220;precondition&#8221; for the Geneva II peace talks.</p>
<p align="left">This lie has been repeated over and over by government and media alike. It has zero basis. The Obama administration claims that this precondition was expressed in the &#8220;Geneva communiqué,&#8221; which was a road map agreement meant to guide the Geneva II peace talks, agreed upon by some of the major parties of the negotiations, including Russia.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/Syria/FinalCommuniqueActionGroupforSyria.pdf">The communiqué</a> does indeed call for a negotiated political transition, but nowhere does it state that such a transition cannot include President Assad. Such a condition would have been outright rejected by Russia.</p>
<p align="left">In fact, the Geneva communiqué includes this crucial statement:</p>
<p align="left">&#8220;[a transition government] could include members of the present [Syrian] government and the opposition and other groups and shall be formed on the basis of mutual consent.&#8221; Nowhere does it specifically mention or imply President Assad would have to leave power first.</p>
<p align="left">The Los Angeles Times recently stepped out of line and <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-syria-talks-20140123,0,992030.story">exposed this lie</a>:</p>
<p align="left">&#8220;[John] Kerry regularly cites the “Geneva communiqué,” a kind of peace road map hammered out in June 2012 during a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/united-nations-ORCUL000009.topic">United Nations</a>-organized summit. But the document does not explicitly call for Assad’s ouster.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">The Obama administration’s constant repeating of this lie only causes divisions in the peace process, undermining the chances that the peace process will succeed.</p>
<p align="left">The Obama administration is especially adamant about this &#8220;Assad must go&#8221; precondition because it knows that, if free and fair elections were held tomorrow in Syria – as part of a UN-backed &#8220;transitional process&#8221; – President Assad would likely win. This is the result of the ethnic and religious minorities in Syria that have rallied behind President Assad, since they’ve witnessed the consistent religious sectarian atrocities committed by the U.S.-backed rebels (which the U.S. media loves to ignore or minimize).</p>
<p align="left">Assad would probably win an election since there is also simply no one else on the government side or the opposition side with his name recognition or popularity. The U.S.-backed rebel war in Syria has vastly strengthened Assad’s political hand, but you wouldn’t know it from the Western, anti-Syrian media.</p>
<p align="left">Demanding Assad’s ouster also does not reflect the situation on the ground. The U.S.-backed rebels have never controlled more than one Syrian city, namely Raqaa, which is dominated by al-Qaeda and is governed under a Taliban-style interpretation of Islamic law, which<a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/security/2014/01/isis-raqq-ban-music-smoking-impose-veil.html"> includes a strict ban on music</a>. Thus, the rebels don’t have the ground power that would even enable them to make the demand that “Assad must go”.</p>
<p align="left">2) The U.S.-backed rebel militias are &#8220;moderate&#8221; Islamic groups.</p>
<p align="left">The fact that this lie can even be uttered publicly without encountering ridicule is a major success of Western media propaganda. The media narrative paints the U.S.-backed &#8220;good&#8221; rebels fighting both the Syrian government and the &#8220;bad&#8221; al-Qaeda linked rebels.</p>
<p align="left">But the &#8220;good&#8221; rebels in the U.S.-backed Islamic Front share the same vision for Syria’s future as the al-Qaeda rebels: a fundamentalist version of Sharia law, where women live in virtual house arrest and where religious minorities are second class citizens (non-Sunni Muslims would simply be butchered, as they are on a regular basis in Syria, which is again minimized or ignored in the Western media.)</p>
<p align="left">The &#8220;moderate rebel&#8221; lie was further exposed recently when a top leader in the most powerful militia, Ahrar al Sham, within the Islamic Front <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2014/01/17/4620554/key-anti-assad-rebel-leader-acknowledges.html#.Uts02BAo7RY">declared Ahrar al Sham to be the &#8220;real&#8221; representative of al-Qaeda in Syria</a>, as opposed to the rival al-Qaeda faction that the Islamic Front had recently begun fighting.</p>
<p align="left">Ahrar al Sham has long been known to be an al-Qaeda type Islamist extremist group; the Western media simply chose to ignore it. But when it was recently made official, the US media chose to continue its ignoring stance, since actually reporting on it would destroy their &#8220;moderate rebel&#8221; lie. The Western media also continues to ignore the fact that the &#8220;moderate&#8221; U.S.-backed Islamic Front<a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0ByBt2sGl4U4hU2lrZGFoeUtkV1k/edit">issued a joint statement</a> that aligned itself to the extremist views of Ahrar al Sham, the &#8220;real&#8221; al-Qaeda.</p>
<p align="left">3) New Evidence of Syrian government &#8220;industrial scale&#8221; torture.</p>
<p align="left">The Western media recently blasted the &#8220;breaking news&#8221; of brand new evidence showing<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/20/world/syria-torture-photos-amanpour/"> massive &#8220;Nazi-like&#8221; torture and murder by the Syrian government</a>, released at the beginning of the Syrian peace talks. This may or may not be true, but the lie here is that the Western media promoted the &#8220;evidence&#8221; as being unquestionably true, when the story doesn’t reach first base when it comes to evidence-based journalism.</p>
<p align="left">All we really know is that there are hundreds of pictures of dead people that a &#8220;trusted source&#8221; says were killed by the Syrian government. The trusted source was designated as such by pro-Western intellectuals, who have earned professional &#8220;credibility&#8221; by helping convict war criminals in the International Criminal Court [ICC]. But as author Diane Johnstone pointed out in her excellent book &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fools-Crusade-Yugoslavia-Western-Delusions/dp/158367084X">Fools Crusade</a>,&#8221; about the war against Yugoslavia – as well as in <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/05/06/do-we-really-need-an-international-criminal-court-2/">other articles</a> – the ICC has long been used by western powers as a tool to create a pretext for war, or a tool to justify a war after the fact.</p>
<p align="left">The evidence of the “NAZI-like” atrocities was written in a study paid for by the government of Qatar, which has long funneled cash, guns, and Jihadis to Syria in aid of the anti-government rebels.</p>
<p align="left">Again, we don’t know if the story is true or not. But such an important investigation should be conducted by the UN or another more objective institution. The same biased dynamic occurred in relation to the infamous chemical weapons attack, where no real evidence was provided, though an unending string of &#8220;experts&#8221; were quoted in the Western media, testifying to the guilt of the Syrian Government. But when Pulitzer prizewinning journalist Seymour Hersh <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n24/seymour-m-hersh/whose-sarin">reported that the Obama administration lied </a>about the rebels not having the capacity to perform such an attack, the Western media simply ignored the legend of journalism. The wrench in the propaganda machine was simply dislodged.</p>
<p align="left">How do these lies become such permanent fixtures in the Western media? <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/12/syrian-opposition-doing-the-talking">An excellent article in the Guardian newspaper</a> recently discussed in depth the principal sources the Western media has used to understand the Syrian conflict.</p>
<p align="left">The article exposed the incredible bias of some of the most important Western media sources on Syria, which is why they were handpicked in the first place to be &#8220;expert&#8221; sources: they had political agendas that were aligned with the US government’s foreign policy decisions. The other side of the conflict was completely ignored, except when it was targeted for ridicule. Thus, Americans and Europeans have a completely one-sided, if not fantasy-based perspective of what is happening in Syria. This has been systematic since the beginning of the conflict, as happened with the Yugoslav, Afghan, Iraq, and Libya wars.</p>
<p align="left">The result of this media-led ignorance could result in yet more unnecessary deaths in a country that now has millions of refugees and over a 100,000 dead. Obama seems like he intends to exploit these peace talks with the intention of blaming the Syrian government for their failure. Having failed to defeat Assad on the battlefield in a proxy war, the Obama administration is trying to win the propaganda war. And once peace talks have failed, talk of war will resume, since &#8220;all other options have failed.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>A month ago, a student toting a shotgun, machete and 125 rounds of ammunition marched into Arapahoe High School in Denver, Colorado.  His target: to kill the debate teacher whom he felt treated him poorly.</p>
<p>On his way to the teacher, he shot a beautiful girl named Claire Davis in the face. She hung on for a week before dying of her wounds. The killer, a regular 17-year-old high school student, tall and lanky, with good looks, shot himself before Swat teams could reach him.</p>
<p>As a former teacher who started teaching in the 1970s, my colleagues and I could not imagine such violence. But here in Denver, we suffered Columbine shootings by Klebold and Harris when they mowed down a dozen kids and teachers.  Another killer shot and killed “Emily” in Bailey, Colorado a few years back. Recently, James Holmes marched into a Denver movie theater to unleash his own killing spree on a bunch of innocent movie attendees.</p>
<p>Even more disturbing: bullied teachers&#8211;145,100 public-School teachers physically attacked by students and 276,700 threatened with injury every year.</p>
<p>Over 4,800,000 women, both girlfriends and wives, suffering beatings by their men annually in the United States—a beating every 15 seconds.</p>
<p>According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, which includes crimes that were <em>not</em> reported to the police, 232,960 women suffer rape in the U.S. annually. That&#8217;s more than 600 women everyday.</p>
<p>The United States carried on two ten-year wars in Iraq and Afghanistan where we killed an estimated 250,000 civilians.  We killed many more Muslim fighters by the tens of thousands. We destroyed their country with our bombs. Because those third world countries lack birth records, identification and death certificates—the numbers could be much higher.</p>
<p>In most large city in America, such as Denver, newscasters relate killings every night of the week.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit and Los Angeles suffer gang killings nightly. </p>
<p>One in four children suffers bullying by a teen thug in high schools across America every day during school terms. In other words, our children cannot attend school without fear of being beat up, harassed, called names and demeaned by meaner, bigger students who have no other purpose in life but to manifest their thuggery.</p>
<p>What bothers me:  we promote horrific violence via our continuous wars promoted by bankers and the military industrial complex that profit at the cost of human lives. We promote TV violence such as “Criminal Minds” and “NCIS” where lots of people commit diabolical mayhem.  We support social media arcade games for kids like “Doom” and worse. Our movies feature horrific violence that pours into our kids minds and emotions.  It’s like the 60s movie “Clockwork Orange” seems normal.  You can watch television “Cops” where violence becomes normal.  Our drones in the Middle East kill any number of humans without identity.</p>
<p>Today, 68 percent of African-American children grow up under the parenting of single mothers and most of them living on welfare and food stamps.  Who babysits those kids? Answer: television.  What do they see?  Answer: violence.  How do they respond?  Answer: black flash mobs, “knockout” games, shoplifting and gang violence.</p>
<p>Over 2.3 million Americans languish in prison.  We spent $1 trillion in the last 43 years on the “War on Drugs”, but a pittance for raising healthy kids. Why haven’t we spent as much money on discovering peaceful ways to rear our children as we spend on killing other people in contrived wars?</p>
<p>This information bothers me because Claire Davis could have been my daughter.  Congresswoman Gabby Gifford could have been my friend.  Your kid might be the one being bullied. I suffered bullying and getting beat up as a skinny kid in grade school and high school. </p>
<p>Question: are we a moral and ethical civilization or do we feature immorality and unethical behavior manifested in our wars and violence as stated above?</p>
<p>Today, 2014, one in six Americans faces hunger.  That includes one in five children.  (Source: <a href="http://www.feedingamerica.org">www.feedingamerica.org</a>)</p>
<p>What makes for peaceful, happy and contributing citizens?  Answer: jobs for parents, homes for kids, excellent schools, playgrounds, after school activities and positive guidance by two parents.</p>
<p>What can we do to change course toward a moral, ethical, peaceful and happy nation?</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to bring our troops home from Afghanistan and other countries around the world. Let our fathers come back home to be fathers instead of fighting useless wars.</li>
<li>We need to limit imports from China and other nations that take jobs away from our 14 million unemployed and 48 million citizens subsisting on food stamps.  We can make all those manufactured products as well as Chinese workers.</li>
<li>We need to stop importing 100,000 legal immigrants every 30 days into America that take jobs away from our own working poor.</li>
<li>We need turn our war machine money into production for alternative energy, conservation and environmental balance.</li>
<li>We need to pay teachers and educational professionals much better salaries in order to educate our children to the highest excellence for competing in the 21st century.  We need classes to teach parents how to parent with respect, loving discipline and positive living.  (Source: <a href="http://www.LoveandLogic.com">www.LoveandLogic.com</a>)</li>
<li>We need to examine how and why we create so much violence in our society. Then, we must take action to stop it such as stopping violent video games, stopping bullying by parenting peaceful kids, stopping TV violence seen by our young and stop glorifying war, violent movies and violent TV for children.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can think of a dozen other ideas, but in the end, if we keep doing what we’re doing, we will continue to suffer daughters, sons, fathers and mothers involved in violence and death.</p>

<p align="left">The man who promised to restore hope and bring change to America, has announced a plan to open five corporate plantations in the United States. On Thursday, President Barack Obama, whose policies have resulted in the greatest number of public sector job losses in US History (Public sector jobs have declined by 718,000 jobs since Obama took office.) announced the opening of five “Promise Zones” located in San Antonio, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, southeastern Kentucky, and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. According to an article in USA Today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">“Under the proposed Promise Zones, the federal government plans to partner with local governments and businesses to provide tax incentives and grants to help combat poverty.” (“<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2014/01/08/obama-promise-zones-san-antonio-philadelphia-los-angeles/4368697/">Obama to name 5 ‘Promise Zones’ for assistance</a>“, USA Today)</p>

<p align="left">Combatting poverty’ has nothing to do with it. Obama plans to shower the nation’s biggest corporations–which recorded record profits in the last year and are presently sitting on more than $1.3 trillion in cash–with more lavish subsidies and tax breaks while providing an endless source of cheap slave labor to boost future earnings. The president believes that the wealth generated in these profit zones, er, promise zones will trickle down to the area’s residents, even though–as the Christian Science Monitor notes–”it can be hard to tell whether a program’s benefits reach the poorest people, rather than flowing largely into the hands of the business owners who get the tax credits.”</p>
<p align="left">Here’s more from USA Today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">“Obama said his administration plans “to partner with 20 of the hardest-hit towns in America to get these communities back on their feet. We’ll work with local leaders to target resources at public safety, and education, and housing.” (USA Today)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Translation: The Obama administration is committed to assisting the corporate oligarchy whenever possible even if it means further eviscerating the rapidly-diminishing US middle class and reducing millions of hard-working Americans to grinding third world poverty. Deregulation will allow corporations to privatize policing, education and any other lucrative public resource or service. According to the New York Times: “White House officials said the Promise Zones initiative would not provide new money, rather it would be aimed at providing the local governments and agencies “aid in cutting through red tape to get access to existing resources.”</p>
<p align="left">No new money??</p>
<p align="left">How do you like that? So, the man that helped push through the multi-trillion dollar Wall Street bailouts is not going to give one red cent to the nation’s poorest and most needy people. Instead, he is going to do whatever he can to eliminate the rules that keep voracious corporations from feeding at the public trough.</p>
<p align="left">Conservative Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky — “praised the proposed Promise Zone for Eastern Kentucky saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">“I wrote a letter last year supporting this designation because this region has suffered enormous economic hardship over the last several years,” McConnell said in a statement.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Mitch McConnell likes Obama’s plan. That says it all, doesn’t it?</p>
<p align="left">Plantations were a familiar feature of the antebellum South, but were abandoned following the Civil War. Now a new generation of corporate kleptocrats want to revive the tradition. They think that weakening consumer demand and persistent stagnation can only be overcome by skirting vital labor protections and shifting more of the cost of production onto workers. Obama’s promise zones provide a way for big business to slip the chains of “onerous” regulations and restore, what many CEO’s believe to be, the Natural Order, that is, a Darwinian, dog-eat-dog world where only the strongest and most cunning survive. This is a world in which Obama has done quite well, although he’s had to distance himself from his political base and throw friends under the bus (Jeremiah Wright) in his relentless climb to the top. Even so, selling out has never been an issue for Obama.</p>
<p align="left">Special economic zones are not a new idea, in fact, they’ve been tried in the UK, Australia and other places where the global bank cartel exerts its grip. In Tokyo, last month, right-wing PM, Shinzo Abe announced the launching of his own “Special Economic Zones”. Here’s a short summary of Abe’s plan from an article in the Japan Times:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">“Special zones aimed at spurring corporate investment through deregulation and tax incentives are to be created in Tokyo as well as Osaka and central Aichi Prefecture….Other deregulation steps to debut in such zones will let private firms operate public schools, let experts without teaching licenses teach classes, expand the scope of treatment that can be administered by non-Japanese doctors and nurses, facilitate the use of foreign drugs and increase the number of hospital beds.” (Japan Times)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Sound familiar? Deregulation, privatization, and cheap labor; the toxic coctail that has vaporized the US middle class and wiped out a good portion of the developing world.</p>
<p align="left">Obama calls these promise zones. We think corporate plantations is a more fitting moniker.</p>

<p>For a long time now holocaust revisionists, aka &#8220;deniers&#8221;, have occupied a spot in the public&#8217;s esteem somewhere below pedophiles and just above serial killers. Now, a new contender for the penultimate position in the scale of public opprobrium has emerged: global warming &#8220;deniers&#8221;. The debate-squelching term has been applied to the likes of Richard Lindtzen, professor emeritus of meteorology at MIT; Roger Pielke Sr., professor emeritus of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State; and Patrick Michaels, past president of the American Association of State Climatologists. A while back, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/scott-pelley-and-catherine-herrick-on-global-warming-coverage/" target="_blank">Scott Pelley</a> of CBS News directly linked the two sets of heretics.</p>
<p>As with holocaust deniers, who enjoyed a brief exposure in the national media in the early 1990s but have since been banned from the airwaves, attempts are being made to deny global warming skeptics access to the podium. The <em><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/10/18/la-times-bans-letters-from-climate-skeptics/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times</a></em> recently banned &#8220;factually inaccurate&#8221; letters to the editor skeptical of human-caused climate change. In November, Mark Hertsgaard, environment correspondent for <i>The Nation, </i>accused Piers Morgan of being &#8220;journalistically irresponsible&#8221; for allowing a denier, Roy Spencer of the University of Alabama-Huntsville, on his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcpvONxkRCo" target="_blank">program</a> (Hertsgaard, who I suspect has a degree in Art History or the like, admonished Dr. Spencer, a former senior climate scientist at NASA, telling him he &#8220;needs to read more scientific papers&#8221;, to which Dr. Spencer graciously responded &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a feeling I&#8217;ve read more than you have, Mark&#8221;.)</p>
<p>Like holocaust denial, global warming denial can be hazardous to your career. In her inaugural address to Department of the Interior staff, the newly-appointed Secretary, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/02/sally-jewell-climate-change-deniers_n_3695153.html" target="_blank">Sally Jewell</a>, warned &#8220;“I hope there are no climate-change deniers in the Department of Interior” (She&#8217;s probably checking the closets right now). <a href="http://www.weather.com/blog/weather/8_11392.html" target="_blank">Heidi Cullen</a>, host of The Weather Channel&#8217;s &#8220;The Climate Code&#8221;, has called for the American Meteorologist Society to decertify weathermen who express skepticism about human activity causing climate change. And in Oregon, Governor <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/environment/jan-june07/northwest_06-21.html" target="_blank">Ted Kulongoski</a>, sought to strip Professor George Taylor of the honorary title &#8220;State Climatologist&#8221;, bestowed on him by Oregon State, because of his anti-warmist views.</p>
<p>Fortunately, global warming denial has not been criminalized as has holocaust denial in Europe&#8230; yet. But <a href="http://leftofthemark.com/quote/robert-f-kennedy-jr-global-warming-skeptics-are-traitors" target="_blank">RFK Jr.</a> once accused supposed financial backers of global warming denial, like Exxon-Mobil, of treason, and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080208132916/http:/www.mcgilldaily.com/view.php?aid=6970" target="_blank">David Suzuki</a>, a well-known Canadian environmentalist, urged his fans to find a way to throw global warming denying politicians in jail because &#8220;what they’re doing is a criminal act&#8221;. <a href="http://grist.org/article/on-climate-denialists-and-nuremberg/" target="_blank">David Roberts</a> of Grist went ballistic in an op-ed in that online mag, labeling climate change denial a &#8220;war crime&#8221; worthy of a Nuremberg-type prosecution. Thankfully, we don&#8217;t prosecute holocaust deniers in this country, and I think it unlikely their global warming co-defendants will suffer that fate either.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one final similarity between holocaust and global warming deniers: they&#8217;re both beginning to win the debate. Success for the global warming skeptics derives from the fact the earth hasn&#8217;t warmed in over a decade, something the models didn&#8217;t predict. In groping for an explanation, warmists have resorted to arguments very similar to those employed by holocaust believers. For instance, in testimony before Congress recently, <a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/misleading-congressional-climate-testimony-christy-pielke.html" target="_blank">David Titley</a>, Deputy Under Secretary for Operations at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in trying to explain the lack of evidence for climate change-induced severe weather, argued &#8220;The Absence of Evidence is not the Evidence of Absence&#8221;, echoing the holocaust believers&#8217; argument that the absence of any evidence of gas chambers is not evidence that gas chambers never existed. Dedicated and courageous scholars &#8211; often writing under pseudonyms for obvious reasons &#8211; have debunked the major holocaust myths to my satisfaction. If the Russian archives are ever opened fully, I&#8217;m sure the revelations they contain will be sufficient to convince the rest of you.</p>
<p>So, if over the next few years, the <a href="http://www.climate.gov/" target="_blank">mean global temperature</a> fails to rise, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25383373?postId=118192465" target="_blank">arctic sea ice</a> recovers its former extent, <a href="http://www.climatedepot.com/2013/07/18/prof-roger-pielke-jr-testimony-on-the-current-state-of-weather-extremes-it-is-misleading-and-just-plain-incorrect-to-claim-that-disasters-associated-with-hurricanes-tornadoes-floods-or-d/" target="_blank">severe weather events</a> don&#8217;t increase in intensity or frequency, the polar bears continue to thrive (while you&#8217;re shedding a tear for the forlorn polar bears drifting towards extinction on their ever-shrinking ice floes, remember the poor penguins, who now have to walk 22 miles further to reach the sea because of the record <a href="http://www.livescience.com/39720-antarctica-ice-record-highs-2013.html" target="_blank">ice extent in the Antarctic</a>), and you find yourself listening with increased respect to what the global warming deniers have to say, please consider whether those other more venerable, even more denigrated deniers might, too, have something to say worth listening to. In fact, why wait? (a good place to start is <a href="http://www.codoh.com/" target="_blank">The Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust</a>)</p>

<p>How do you sum up 2013 as a year for the United States and her citizens?  What criteria do you use?  Good, bad and ugly?  As Clint Eastwood said, “A man’s got to know his limitations.  Well, do ya’ punk?”  The same could be said for our country.  Do we understand our limitations?</p>
<p>On the immigration front, 20 million illegal aliens “itched” to get themselves legalized so they could continue their “Aztlan Reconquista” of the four southwestern states.  Spanish co-equals English in America because Congress runs from any sense of responsibility to our immigration laws and the English language that built America.  As their numbers grow, illegal migrants march toward their goal with the help of President Barack Obama, himself a non-citizen,  the ACLU, and 535 Congressional critters that refuse to enforce our Constitutional laws.</p>
<p>After 11 years replete with $1 trillion wasted, our military men and women remain in the Islamic insane asylum of Afghanistan doing nothing but pouring money and lives down the rat-hole.  The military industrial complex works its wonders with Obama and Congress to start a war with Iran.   The bankers and moneychangers lick their chops at the thought of endless and meaningless wars overseas.  As General Smedley Butler said in his memoirs, “War is a racket for bankers and politicians.”</p>
<p>Psychologists expect anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 young men will commit suicide from their senseless service in the Islamic nuthouse of the Middle East.  Endless forms of PTSD cause broken marriages, fatherless families, alcoholic &#038; drug addicted soldiers and nonstop misfortune for our military veterans.</p>
<p>For a 5th straight year, Barack Obama proves himself an inept, incompetent and totally lackluster president of the United States.  Food stamp recipients charged from 36 million at the beginning of his first term to 48.1 million subsisting on food stamps today.  He drove the federal deficit from $12 trillion in 2008 to its current $18 trillion in 2013.  More blacks suffer unemployment, poverty, incarceration and welfare than under any other president.</p>
<p>While 14 million Americans remained unemployed and 7 million under employed, Obama and Congress imported over 2.0 million legal and illegal immigrants into America in 2013.   Obama and Congress failed to create jobs for the 48.1 million Americans living on food stamps, but they increased section 8 housing, “free” school lunches, medical care and ESL courses for illegal foreign children.</p>
<p>Because the U.S. continues as the third largest and fastest growing country because of immigration, we also accelerate global carbon footprint with millions of added car exhausts, chimneys and factories that acidifies our oceans and causes such horrific weather changes that create Hurricane Sandy, Katrina and Typhoon Haiyan.  With the expected 100 million additional immigrants in the next 36 years, we can expect Mother Nature to respond commensurately.</p>
<p>On the sociological front, we saw Hispanic George Zimmerman kill one young thug named Trayvon Martin that created national headlines while 1,400 black Americans killed another 1,400 black Americans—but no one at the national level, the Black Caucus or Al Sharpton made a mention of blacks slaughtering blacks.  Meanwhile, the mainstream media made not one mention of “Black Flash Mobs” or “Black Knockout Games” where American blacks run around killing whites for the fun of it.  Three blacks in Oklahoma killed a white Australian college baseball player, “For the fun of it.”</p>
<p>If you look at the dropout/flunkout rates in our educational systems such as a 76 percent high school dropout rate in Detroit, Michigan to 60 percent flunkout rate in Mexican-dominated Los Angeles, we continue on our downward spiral of a “functionally illiterate” civilization where dumb people outnumber educated people, but enjoy endless welfare, food, cell phones, medical care and housing on the backs of those of us who study, work and contribute.</p>
<p>On the federal level, we see a culture of corruption in the Obama White House and Congress that gave us incompetence, malfeasance and covered up the Benghazi murders, Fast and Furious gun running, NSA spying, 22 Islamic jihad compounds now operating in America and imported tens of thousands of Muslims via legal immigration that will end up undermining our country’s culture, language and laws. </p>
<p>Sharia Law charges into our country as fast as their numbers grow.  Obama features eight Islamic staff  working full time in the White House.  In the next three years, we will see countless tens of thousands of Muslims imported into America to bring “hope and change” for Islam in America.  At some point, Muslims will bomb our electrical grid with multiple-coordinated teams, which will make 9/11 look like a garden party.   Few of us realize our vulnerability, and remember, when jihad warriors succeed, they enjoy 72 virgins in Islamic heaven.</p>
<p>On the health-care front, Obamacare stumbled, faltered and fell on every level. Ironically, Americans show they don’t care about their health, as over half of our population grows intolerably obese.  Fifty millions Americans smoke, 10 million alcoholics abound while diabetes became a national epidemic.  Cancer continues as the number one killer, but few connect it to our contaminated air, water and soil via endless chemicals injected into our biosphere.</p>
<p>On the trade front, China owns us.  They buy U.S. companies, land and entire office districts here in the USA.  By the time they get done, they will dictate what we do, who we are and how we operate.</p>
<p>As we transform and deform into a polyglot, chaotic, multi-lingual and multicultural society, we continue to watch the Middle Class degrade into non-existence.  We watch the American flag become the Mexican flag, the Middle Eastern flag and hundreds of other flags from immigrants that could care less about America.</p>
<p>On the international front, no one suspects or reports on the growing radioactive plume originating from Japan’s Fukushima nuclear power plant meltdown.  That radio-active water circulates into all the oceans—contaminating every living creature below the waters around the world—and contaminating all the fish and marine life we use for food.  That event will prove the greatest ecological debacle for humanity for all of history.  Cancers, destroyed eco-systems, degraded oceans and much worse await humanity.</p>
<p>What’s amazing about 2013?  Men wasted 29 hours weekly watching the idiot box as to football, baseball, hockey and basketball.  For the Americans with jobs, we partied, played and ordered pizza. We drove around without the faintest clue as to what Congress and Obama continue accomplishing:  utterly and completely ignoring our sacred Constitution and Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>As we dance into 2014, I can only appreciate that our country faces financial collapse, sociological degradation, environmental deterioration, accelerated immigration numbers to 2.0 million annually, millions of jobless whites, blacks and Hispanics, energy exhaustion, environmental breakdown and resource depletion.</p>
<p>Will 2014 get better?  This should foreshadow the answer as Mark Twain said, “Suppose you were an idiot; and suppose you were a member of Congress; ah, but I repeat myself.”</p>
<p>Another Facebook writer said, “Obama is what you get when you allow idiots, illegals and welfare recipients to vote.”</p>

<p>Despite the <a title="Etymology" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FEtymology&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9eL1ifXrsvUsD2aAV63VZJ8bo1A" target="_blank">origin</a> of the term from the <a title="Ancient Greek" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAncient_Greek&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEKWSOqBEM_STiDHSGcy63CRb0PSQ" target="_blank">Greek</a> roots “<i>skhizein” which means</i> &#8220;to split&#8221;, schizophrenia does not imply a &#8220;multiple personality disorder.”  The term means a &#8220;splitting of mental functions.”  You might say that someone suffering from a multiple personality disorder walks around with an endless number of “distinct” persons in his or her head.  All of them compete for dominance.  All of them create chaos in that person’s mind.</p>
<p>Enter the term “multiculturalism” where multiple cultures reside in the same country.   Ultimately cultures conflict with one another via people, passions and language.</p>
<p><a title="Jonathan H. Turner" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FJonathan_H._Turner&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEAybeFrUyI_XN2dAjss8pQCyVqXA" target="_blank">Jonathan H. Turner</a> defines it as a conflict caused by &#8220;differences in <a title="Culture" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCulture&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGU5LgCmmlUbeyY33uAATGv63CeQA" target="_blank">cultural</a> <a title="Value (personal and cultural)" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FValue_%2528personal_and_cultural%2529&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHHL73EVApyuuXGZzyCOWcWwHmyEA" target="_blank">values</a> and <a title="Belief" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBelief&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF1Qmzn-yV07ZFPBVtE1wqC4w5xmA" target="_blank">beliefs</a><wbr></wbr> that place people at odds with one another&#8221;. He defines this conflict as, “One that occurs when peoples’ expectations of a certain behavior coming from their cultural backgrounds are not met.  They face others that possess different cultural backgrounds and different expectations.”</p>
<p>We proved that cultures don’t mix when we usurped the Native American Indians of North America.  They have not integrated into the white man’s culture whatsoever.</p>
<p>“Cultural conflicts are difficult to resolve as parties to the conflict have different beliefs,” said Turner.  “Cultural conflicts intensify when those differences become reflected in <a title="Politics" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPolitics&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGzv_OuriiecYpuFuk8FaLbIiVqXA" target="_blank">politics</a>, particularly on a macro level.  An example of cultural conflict is <a title="Abortion debate" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAbortion_debate&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqi14-tEaBI25C6NUa77NvNNHdlg" target="_blank">the debate</a> over <a title="Abortion" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAbortion&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEgEhH1VH7wQaZKS-rHEvmCd7_52Q" target="_blank">abortion</a>.  <a title="Ethnic cleansing" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FEthnic_cleansing&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7eMSsKpDe6zXCx4kkafSpz_X8Kg" target="_blank">Ethnic cleansing</a> is another extreme example of cultural conflict. Wars can also be a result of a cultural conflict.”</p>
<p>The African-Americans versus European-American conflict rages in the United States without pause from 1776 to 2013.  No amount of laws, education, forced integration, police or legal consequences stop racial discrimination, racial bias, racism or violence.</p>
<p>Whether in the NFL two weeks ago with one black and one white player fighting over race or the Zimmerman-Martin killing or voting a black president into the White House—Americans fail to resolve the racial-cultural divide that permeates every city in America where blacks, Mexicans and whites mix.</p>
<p>Today, blacks in big cities practice a new game where they “Knockout” a white person from behind with a hammer or 2&#215;4 board.  “Black flash mobs” run around major US cities looting stores and killing white people. They take a video of their kills and boast on You Tube.  Much the same occurred in the 80s, 90s and last decade with blacks car- jacking whites in Detroit, Michigan at stoplights.  Whites fled to the tune of over 1.0 million over 20 years. Their flight dropped Detroit from 1.85 million to its current 680,000 today—over 90 percent Arabic-Black minority.</p>
<p>Illegal alien Mexican migrants attempt to fight their way into America demanding we suspend our laws in favor of legalizing their lawlessness. As their numbers continue to grow, we can expect violent demonstrations. They demand Americans speak Spanish and wherever Mexicans command dominant numbers, Americans must teach Mexican kids in Spanish. Mexican racism runs deep and virulent.</p>
<p>If you look at Norway, United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Belgium and Holland today, you see the results of multiculturalism turning their countries into “Schizophrenic societies.”  All of them see major crime waves of rapes, murders, shoplifting, bursting prisons, schools in chaos, enclaving of entire cities into cultural ghettos, language changes, cultural changes and loss of societal cohesiveness.  Belgium, once all-European, will become an Islamic caliphate within four decades.  Its culture and language face ultimate displacement by its Islamic immigrants.</p>
<p>Of special note, Swedish women can no longer walk down the streets of Stockholm by themselves for fear of being accosted, raped or murdered by Muslim immigrant males.  Same in Norway and in France where Muslims dominate a specific enclave!</p>
<p>The United Kingdom, Holland and France face similar fates.</p>
<p>Within 37 years, the United States faces becoming a “Schizophrenic Society” with 100 million immigrants streaming into its borders from 150 countries around the world.  Some cultures will create and harbor their own in ghettos like the ones they fled.  Others will compete for dominance like the Islamic immigrants as they follow the prime directive of their Koran—“You must convert or kill all non-believers, especially the Jews.”</p>
<p>As this series winds down as to what America will look like in 2050, you cannot help but cringe at the loss of your own language, culture and way of life.  You may be sickened at what you see already occurring across America in Mexican ghettoes like Los Angeles, Houston and along the border with “colonias” that reek of third world misery.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to see our country turned into a schizophrenic cultural quagmire, call Speaker of the House John Boehner at <a href="tel:1%20202%20225%200600" target="_blank">1 202 225 0600</a>:</p>
<p>“Mr. Boehner, I understand that S744 doubles legal immigration from its current 1.0 million annually to 2.0 million while giving amnesty to 12 to 20 million illegal migrants. Do you understand that such an amnesty would flood America with over 100 million immigrants by 2050—a scant 37 years from now. How will we be able to water, house, work, feed, educate, medicate and care for that many people when we already suffer 48 million Americans who cannot secure jobs and live on food stamps? How will we maintain our environment and standard of living in light of those numbers. As an American citizen, I demand that you reduce all immigration to less than 100,000 annually and enforce the laws on the books to arrest, prosecute and jail employers of illegal migrants. That will help illegal migrants to go home on their own dime when they don’t have a job. Our own unemployed citizens can take those jobs at a living wage.”</p>
<p>Also: call your own U.S. Senators and leave the same message.</p>
