<p>On the surface, the economic atmosphere of the U.S. has appeared rather calm and uneventful. Stocks are up, employment isn’t great but jobs aren’t collapsing into the void (at least not openly), and the U.S. dollar seems to be going strong. Peel away the thin veneer, however, and a different financial horror show is revealed.</p>
<p>U.S. stocks have enjoyed unprecedented crash protection due to a steady infusion of fiat money from the Federal Reserve known as quantitative easing. With the advent of the “taper”, QE is now swiftly coming to a close (as is evident in the overall reduction in treasury market purchases), and is slated to end by this fall, if not sooner.</p>
<p>Employment has been boosted only in statistical presentation, and not in reality. The Labor Department’s creative accounting of job numbers omits numerous factors, the most important being the issue of long term unemployed. Millions of people who have been jobless for so long they no longer qualify for benefits are being removed from the rolls. This quiet catastrophe has the side bonus of making it appear as though unemployment is going down.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury bonds, and by extension the dollar, have also stayed afloat due to the river of stimulus being introduced by the Federal Reserve. That same river, through QE, is now drying up.</p>
<p>In my article <em><a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/1977-the-final-swindle-of-private-american-wealth-has-begun" target="_blank">The Final Swindle Of Private American Wealth Has Begun</a>, </em>I outline the data which leads me to believe that the Fed taper is a deliberate action in preparation for an impending market collapse. The effectiveness of QE stimulus has a shelf-life, and that shelf life has come to an end. With debt monetization no longer a useful tool in propping up the ailing U.S. economy, central bankers are publicly stepping back. Why? If a collapse occurs while stimulus is in full swing, the Fed immediately takes full blame for the calamity, while being forced to admit that central banking as a concept serves absolutely no meaningful purpose.</p>
<p>My research over many years has led me to conclude that a collapse of the American system is not only expected by international financiers, but is in fact being engineered by them. The Fed is an entity created by globalists for globalists. These people have no loyalties to any one country or culture. Their only loyalties are to themselves and their private organizations.</p>
<p>While many people assume that the stimulus measures of the Fed are driven by a desire to save our economy and currency, I see instead a concerted program of destabilization which is<em>meant </em>to bring about the eventual demise of our nation’s fiscal infrastructure. What some might call “kicking the can down the road,” I call deliberately stretching the country thin over time, so that any indirect crisis can be used as a trigger event to bring the ceiling crashing down.</p>
<p>In the past several months, the Fed taper of QE and subsequently U.S. bond buying has coincided with steep declines in purchases by China, a dump of one-fifth of holdings by Russia, and an overall decline<a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-20/pboc-says-no-longer-in-china-s-favor-to-boost-record-reserves.html" target="_blank"> in new purchases of U.S. dollars for FOREX reserves.</a></p>
<p>With the Ukraine crisis now escalating to fever pitch, BRIC nations are openly discussing the probability of “de-dollarization” in international summits, and the ultimate dumping of the dollar<a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-05-13/russia-holds-de-dollarization-meeting-china-iran-willing-drop-usd-bilateral-trade" target="_blank">as the world reserve currency.</a></p>
<p>The U.S. is in desperate need of a benefactor to purchase its ever rising debt and keep the system running. Strangely, a buyer with apparently bottomless pockets has arrived to pick up the slack that the Fed and the BRICS are leaving behind. But, who is this buyer?</p>
<p>At first glance, it appears to be the tiny nation of <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/15/usa-economy-capital-idUSL1N0O117Z20140515" target="_blank">Belgium</a>.</p>
<p>While foreign investment in the U.S. has sharply declined since March, Belgium has quickly become the third largest buyer of Treasury bonds, just behind China and Japan, purchasing more than $200 billion in securities in the past five months, adding to a total stash of around $340 billion. This development is rather bewildering, primarily because Belgium’s GDP as of 2012 was a miniscule $483 billion, meaning, Belgium has spent nearly the entirety of its yearly GDP on our debt.</p>
<p>Clearly, this is impossible, and someone, somewhere, is using Belgium as a proxy in order to prop up the U.S. But who?</p>
<p>Recently, a company based in Belgium called Euroclear has come forward claiming to be the culprit behind the massive purchases of American debt. Euroclear, though, is not a direct buyer. Instead, the bank is a facilitator, using what it calls a “collateral highway” to allow central banks and international banks to move vast amounts of securities <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.world-exchanges.org/news-views/euroclear%E2%80%99s-global-%E2%80%9Ccollateral-highway%E2%80%9D-boost-collateral-flows" target="_blank">around the world</a> faster than ever before.</p>
<p>Euroclear claims to be an administrator for more than $24 trillion in worldwide assets and transactions, but these transactions are not initiated by the company itself. Euroclear is a middleman used by our secret buyer to quickly move U.S. Treasuries into various accounts without ever being identified. So the question remains, who is the true buyer?</p>
<p>My investigation into Euroclear found some interesting facts. Euroclear has financial relationships with more than 90 percent of the world’s central banks and was once partly owned and run by 120 of the largest financial institutions back when it was called the “Euroclear System”. The organization was consolidated and operated by none other than JP Morgan Bank in 1972. In 2000, Euroclear was officially incorporated and became its own entity. However, one must remember, once a JP Morgan bank, <a style="color: #006699;" href="https://www.euroclear.com/en/about/Our-history.html" target="_blank"><em>always</em> a JP Morgan bank.</a></p>
<p>Another interesting fact – Euroclear also has <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.sberbank-cib.ru/eng/about/news/Sberbank_CIB_in_press/index.wbp?number=1373">a strong relationship with the Russian government </a>and is a primary broker for Russian debt to foreign investors. This once again proves my ongoing point that Russia is tied to the global banking cabal as much as the United States. The East vs. West paradigm is a sham of the highest order.</p>
<p>Euroclear’s ties to the banking elite are obvious; however, we are still no closer to discovering the specific groups or institution responsible for buying up U.S. debt. I think that the use of Euroclear and Belgium may be a key in understanding this mystery.</p>
<p>Belgium is the political center of the EU, with more politicians, diplomats and lobbyists than Washington D.C. It is also, despite its size and economic weakness, a member of an exclusive economic club called the <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.bis.org/list/g10publications/index.htm" target="_blank">“Group Of Ten”</a> (G10).</p>
<p>The G10 nations have all agreed to participate in a “General Arrangement to Borrow” (GAB) launched in 1962 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The GAB is designed as an ever cycling fund which members pay into. In times of emergency, members can ask the IMF’s permission for a release of funds. If the IMF agrees, it then injects capital through Treasury purchases and SDR allocations. Essentially, the IMF takes our money, then gives it back to us in times of desperation (with strings attached).  A similar program called &#8216;New Arrangements To Borrow&#8217; (NAB) involves 38 member countries.  This fund was boosted to approximately 370 billion SDR (or $575 billion dollars U.S.) as the derivatives crisis struck markets in 2008-2009.  Without a full and independent audit of the IMF, however, it is impossible to know the exact funds it has at its disposal, or how many SDR&#8217;s it has created.</p>
<p>It should be noted the Bank of International Settlements is also an overseer of the G10. If you want to learn more about the darker nature of globalist groups like the IMF and the BIS, read my articles, <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2074-russia-is-dominated-by-global-banks-too"><em>Russia Is Dominated By Global Banks, Too</em></a>, and <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2126-false-eastwest-paradigm-hides-the-rise-of-global-currency"><em>False East/West Paradigm Hides The Rise Of Global Currency</em>.</a></p>
<p>The following article from <em>Harpers</em> titled <em>“</em>Ruling The World Of Money,” was published in 1983 and boasts about the secrecy and “ingenuity” of the Bank Of International Settlements, an unaccountable body of financiers that dominates the <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.sharelynx.com/papers/BISRTWOM.php" target="_blank">very course of economic life</a> around the world.</p>
<p>It is my belief that Belgium, as a member of the G10 and the GAB/NAB agreements, is being used as a proxy by the BIS and the IMF to purchase U.S. debt, but at a high price. I believe that the banking elite are hiding behind their middleman, Euroclear, because they do not want their purchases of Treasuries revealed too soon. I believe that the IMF in particular is accumulating U.S. debt to be used later as leverage to absorb the dollar and finalize the rise of their SDR currency basket as the world reserve standard.</p>
<p>Imagine what would happen if all foreign creditors abandoned U.S. debt purchases because the dollar was no longer seen as viable as a world reserve currency.  Imagine that the Fed&#8217;s efforts to stimulate through fiat printing became useless in propping up Treasuries, serving only to devalue the domestic buying power of our currency.  Imagine that the IMF swoops in as the lender of last resort; the only entity willing to service our debt and keep the system running.  Imagine what kind of concessions America would have to make to a global loan shark like the IMF.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, the plan to replace the dollar is not mere &#8220;theory&#8221;.  In fact, IMF head Christine Lagarde <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2011/0214/297662-g20/">has openly called for a &#8220;global financial system&#8221;</a> to take over in the place of the current dollar based system.</p>
<p>The Bretton Woods System, established in 1944, was used by the United Nations and participating governments to form international rules of economic conduct, including fixed rates for currencies and establishing the dollar as the monetary backbone. The IMF was created during this shift towards globalization as the BIS slithered into the background after its business dealings with the Nazis were exposed. It was the G10, backed by the IMF, that then signed the Smithsonian Agreement in 1971 which ended the Bretton Woods system of fixed currencies, as well as any remnants of the gold standard. This led to the floated currency system we have today, as well as the slow poison of monetary inflation which has now destroyed more than 98 percent of the dollar’s purchasing power.</p>
<p>I believe the next and final step in the banker program is to reestablish a new Bretton Woods style system in the wake of an engineered catastrophe. That is to say, we are about to go full circle. Perhaps Ukraine will be the cover event, or tensions in the South China Sea. Just as Bretton Woods was unveiled during World War II, Bretton Woods redux may be unveiled during World War III. In either case, the false East/West paradigm is the most useful ploy the elites have to bring about a controlled decline of the dollar.</p>
<p>The new system will reintroduce the concept of fixed currencies, but this time, all currencies will be fixed or “pegged” to the value of the SDR global basket. The IMF holds a global SDR summit every five years, and the next meeting is set for the beginning of 2015.</p>
<p>If the Chinese yuan is brought into the SDR basket next year, if the BRICS enter into a conjured economic war with the West, and if the dollar is toppled as the world reserve, there will be nothing left in terms of fiscal structure in the way of a global currency system. If the public does not remove the globalist edifice by force, the IMF and the BIS will then achieve their dream – the complete dissolution of economic sovereignty, and the acceptance by the masses of global financial governance. The elites don’t want to hide behind the curtain anymore. They want recognition. They want to be worshiped. And, it all begins with the secret buyout of America, the implosion of our debt markets, and the annihilation of our way of life.</p>

<p>We are almost 3 months away from the 100th anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand. If we are lucky, Wall Street’s puppet government in Washington will not blow up the world by June 28, 2014.</p>
<p>I have always despised President Woodrow Wilson for getting America into World War I. I want to cure the world of reoccurring Depressions through Worldwide Debt Cancellation and Monetary Reform. As I have explained before, Depressions in the West are caused by the accumulation of Unpayable Debts. These occur because Bankers have the right to charge us interest on money they created out of nothing. We need a non-interest bearing currency like President Lincoln’s Greenbacks. And we also must end fractional reserve banking which allows a bank to lend out ten dollars for every one on deposit. Woodrow Wilson gave us the Federal Reserve bank and WW I. We have had cycles of wars and Depressions ever since.</p>
<p>I would like to compare 1914 to what is happening today. Let me begin by quoting something I wrote about World War I a few years ago.</p>
<p>Edith Cavell made a fatal mistake. She mistakenly believed she lived in a democracy. She was a British nurse working in Belgium in 1915. She saw first hand the horrors of trench warfare. She also saw a quick and easy means for England to end the war with a victory. She wrote a letter to the Nursing Mirror which was published on April 15th, 1915. She said that ‘Belgian Relief’ efforts were actually being sent to Germany which would have to sue for peace without this aid from the allies. England was quite literally feeding the German army that was killing millions of French and British soldiers. What she did not know was that similar allied war materiel was being sent to Germany via Sweden and other neutral nations so the war could continue for several more years.</p>
<p>Sir William Wiseman heard about her letter. He was the head of British Intelligence in North America for MI6. He was a partner at the Rothschild owned Kuhn and Loeb Investment Bank. He ordered the Germans to arrest Edith Cavell. She was subsequently shot as a spy. Her mistake was to think that she lived in a democracy where the people could vote, write letters to the editor and have a say in the life and death decisions of the nation. She did not live to see what we have seen.</p>
<p>Americans ought not to believe they live in a democracy. Our politicians cannot prove to us that our votes are honestly counted. Every President since 1989 has been a CIA asset. The CIA is allowed to fly heroin and cocaine into America by the plane load. And the CIA is allowed to go into Senate Intelligence Committee computers and erase documents proving the Agency guilty of torture.</p>
<p>The media seems all too willing to cover up every plot against the American people from the assassination of President Kennedy to the controlled demolitions of the Murrah Federal building on April 19, 1995 and World Trade Center Towers 1, 2 and 7 on September 11, 2001. They also were willing to let the previous administration tell us lies to justify the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. And now the current administration tells us lies about Crimea. Believing their propaganda could get us all killed.</p>
<p>The US paid the opposition $5 billion to start riots before the May elections could be held. Then they hired snipers from as far away as Israel to shoot both the protesters and the police. They installed a Jewish banker as President without elections because they were not sure the people would vote to join the European Union in May. The coup leaders passed laws making the minority Hungarian and Russian languages sort of illegal. And just as they did in Libya the Americans stole the Ukraine’s gold and looted their banks. This plan to seize the Ukraine was mentioned in print by Zbigniew Brzezinski in 2007. He assumed Russia would respond by taking back the Crimea which Khrushchev had given away in 1954.</p>
<p>Barack Obama and his advisers are probably even more incompetent than Woodrow Wilson and his crew. The Obama crowd has announced war game exercises for Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and the Baltics. Hopefully, Putin understands America cannot do anything militarily against a real Army. Obama’s advisers would like to crush Russia with sanctions. That will never happen. Russia has gold, oil, natural gas and other products that people all over the world want to buy. Nobody wants to buy America’s Genetically Modified Organisms. Even with retail stores dying America is still importing far more than it exports. And the Government Accounting Office said that the alleged 680 billion 2013 US budget deficit was really a trillion dollars. America by design has a permanently sick economy. America cannot survive sanctions.</p>
<p>Russia intends to announce the Holy Grail of energy deals in May when Putin visits China. China will buy Russian oil and natural gas with yuan. The United States has been occupying Afghanistan, funding Al Qaeda against Syria and killing people in Pakistan and Yemen with drones to prevent pipelines from distributing natural gas to Europe and to China. This restraint of trade has forced the price of natural gas and oil higher. Americans pay what they think are high rates for electricity but their natural gas prices are low. I am not familiar with the details of English utility bills but their utility bills are a lot higher than ours. And their government allows really outrageous gouging. European Union energy rules do not seem to be helping either. Barack’s forcing Russia to sell oil and natural gas to China will severely harm our allies in Great Britain and Europe. The economy of the EU cannot survive a 40% rise in their utility bills. They are near collapse anyway you say. Yes. But sanctions if not stopped now will push them over the edge sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>NATO wants to bring the Ukraine into their military alliance. This means if the Ukrainian coup leaders want to start World War III, we are all obligated to die. I once heard a Scotsman say that NATO stands for Not Altogether Thought Out. The Russians as part of that May Summit with China will be selling them Sukhoi SU-35 jet fighters. They can out maneuver the American F-22 and F-35 both of which are not really operational.</p>
<p>Prior to Putin’s visit to China in May the Chinese are expected to announce their gold holdings late in April. The last time they announced those holdings was in April of 2009. Sun Tzu in The Art of War said ‘when you are many pretend to be few.’ As I have said before, China has at least 7,000 tons of gold. They might announce a much lower number or delay the press release if they are not yet ready to reveal a gold backed yuan. They might prefer to do that in May or at least to announce something like the End of the Petrodollar which would be Phase I of the destruction of the US economy. That could take the form of an announcement that oil and natural gas would henceforth be bought and sold only in yuan, rubles and gold. That would send the dollar into a tailspin from which it will never recover.</p>
<p>All of this will come to a head at least a month before the 100th anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand on June 28, 2014. This time around I am hopeful that the US military which several times has had to say No to launching World War III by attacking Iran will refuse to get us and themselves killed. Why should we die because Wall Street cannot manage the economy without stealing our money by the tens of trillions, starving people to death by the hundreds of millions and killing people in their wars by the billions?</p>

<p>The psychopathic propaganda power brokers are inciting hysteria over expanding their Ukrainian coup operation. Pushing Russia to accept a hostile empire on their border is irrational. Belligerence and intimidation makes indefensible foreign affairs relationships. Those who swallow the &#8220;wag the dog&#8221; script that circulates in the Western mainstream media, deceived or brainwashed, are incapable of any independent thought. The forces that seek unremitting interventionist intrusions that thrive on self-induced chaos are the true threats to world peace.</p>
<p>Until the perception and experience of the intrepid Michael Scheuer becomes universally accepted, the failed foreign policy mistakes will continue as seen in <a href="http://non-intervention.com/1181/russia-annexing-crimea-is-the-cost-of-u-s-eu-intervention-in-ukraine/">Russia annexing Crimea is the cost of U.S.-EU intervention in Ukraine</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Overall, U.S. and Western leaders should be lining up to thank Vladimir Putin for a painful but thorough lesson in how the adult leader of a nation protects his country’s genuine national interests. And, it must be noted, Putin is not teaching rocket science. Had Western leaders received a decent education — especially in the fields of history and human nature — they would have been absolutely certain from the start that any destabilizing Western intervention in Ukraine that even remotely threatened Russia’s assured access to its Crimean naval bases would provoke precisely the kind of Russian response that occurred. They also would have known that West and the UN could bleat forever about the requirements of various treaties and international law, but that a nation acting to protect what it perceives to be life-or-death national interests — as is Putin’s Russia — is both insane and suicidal if it refrains from acting because of a raft of documents designed to address Cold War conditions that no longer exist.</p>
<p>The lesson of the Ukraine crisis — if it ends without war — for the U.S. and the EU will be crystal clear: Hoe your own row, and mind your own business. If it ends in a civil or European war, they will have only themselves to blame.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>With the results from the Crimean referendum in hand the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/crimea-referendum-explainer-ukraine-russia">Guardian</a> newspaper reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The referendum ballot itself, as posted a few days ago to the parliament&#8217;s website, doesn&#8217;t exactly give voters an option to say &#8220;No&#8221;. The two choices are:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Do you support joining Crimea with the Russian Federation as a subject of Russia?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you support restoration of the 1992 Crimean constitution, and Crimea&#8217;s status as part of Ukraine?</p></blockquote>
<p>This second option is somewhat contradictory: the 1992 constitution asserts Crimea is an independent state and not part of Ukraine (reference to autonomy within Ukraine was inserted at a later date). By &#8220;supporting the restoration of the 1992 constitution&#8221; voters will actually support enhanced autonomy. No matter what, voters are ticking a box for independence from Ukraine.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the inimitable and immortal words of that heroine of all <a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/2014/03/13/3094109/apnewsbreak-transgender-troop.html">transgender</a> sociopaths, the former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton sums up the double standard: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka0_nz53CcM">What Difference Does It Make?</a> The bipartisan support for an unbalanced death wish to jump-start the DEFCON alert level, reflected in the comments of <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/gen-dempsey-us-ready-for-military-response-to-russia-if-crimean-conflict-escalates-339144.html">General Dempsey: US ready for military response to Russia if Crimean conflict escalates</a>, should alarm everyone. “We do have treaty obligations with our NATO allies. And I have assured them that if that treaty obligation is triggered [in Europe], we would respond.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a listing of reports on Lessons of the Ukrainian Coup, examine the latest <a href="http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/?u=1f36c52155dbd59aea0b01d76&amp;id=2816c363ed&amp;e=ed5705a7ca">BATR RealPolitik Newsletter &#8211; March 13, 2014</a>. Especially appreciate the Robert Parry article, <a href="http://consortiumnews.com/2014/02/23/neocons-and-the-ukraine-coup/">Neocons and the Ukraine Coup</a>, which targets the perverse mentality of the NeoCon influence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now, you have Assistant Secretary of State Nuland, the wife of prominent neocon Robert Kagan, acting as a leading instigator in the Ukrainian unrest, explicitly seeking to pry the country out of the Russian orbit. Last December, she reminded Ukrainian business leaders that, to help Ukraine achieve “its European aspirations, we have invested more than $5 billion.” She said the U.S. goal was to take “Ukraine into the future that it deserves.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Any attempt to establish sanity in foreign policy must recognize that the betrayers within have sold out America for the last century. Foggy Bottom is the depository of dual loyalists as explained in the Totalitarian Collectivism essay, <a href="http://consortiumnews.com/2014/02/23/neocons-and-the-ukraine-coup/">The State Department&#8217;s New World Order Agenda</a>.</p>
<p>Just who are the maniacal lunatics that drive this insatiable need to threaten continuous war to achieve global imperium? One needs not be a Putin booster to recognize that the post 911 expansions of a garrison mentality guarantees further military expeditions into the internal affairs of any country that bucks the “international community” New World Order goals.</p>

<p>Author of the book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-American-Empire-Rodrigue-Tremblay/dp/0741418878/ref=sr_11_1/104-8428100-2298348?ie=UTF8">The New American Empire</a>”, Rodrigue Tremblay exposes the lunacy behind <a href="http://www.thepeoplesvoice.org/TPV3/Voices.php/2014/03/06/the-bush-obama-s-neocon-foreign-policy-o">The Bush-Obama&#8217;s Neocon Foreign Policy of Isolating Russia and of Expanding NATO is a Dismal Failure</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“President Barack Obama was candid in admitting it on Monday March 3, 2014, when he said that &#8220;we are indicating to the Russians [that] if in fact they continue on the current trajectory they’re on, then we are examining a whole series of steps — economic, diplomatic— that will isolate Russia.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, it is precisely this desire to expand NATO and to isolate Russia by incorporating all the countries bordering Russia into NATO, i.e. a strategy of geopolitical and military encirclement of Russia, which has provoked that country when it felt threatened in its national security.</p>
<p>The truth is that NATO should have been disbanded after the collapse of the Soviet empire in 1991, and especially after the Warsaw Pact was itself dismantled . . . But no! The United States wanted to take advantage of the situation and demanded that everything fell into the military-financial U.S. Empire.”</p>
<p>The Global Gulag essay, <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/021203.html">NATO a Dinosaur Overdue for Extinction</a>, amplifies upon this conclusion.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If the breakdown in NATO is destined to avail an opportunity to curtail the Yankee Hyperpower, the alternative need not be the formation of another suspect alliance. It is not unpatriotic to advocate the wisdom in an America First policy. NATO doesn’t secure an advance for our country, but only provides the military command and enforcement that imposes the will of global masters. Resistance and opposition against an independent EU rapid defense force, comes not from the nations of Europe, but from the elites that control the mechanisms of global power. NATO is one of their tools. Alliances are one of their methods. And suppression of viable self determination is their cherished goal.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Just think what the response would be if Putin reacted to the bellicose threats from EU/NATO/US to intervene into whatever geographic Ukraine composition remains, by re-creating Russian bases in the Western hemisphere? Venezuela becoming the 21th Century Cuba cannot stand. You can hear the cries – no Russian Guantánamo Bay bases in our backyard.</p>
<p>The impotency of superpower status means that the nuclear option becomes executable. This attitude is pure madness, and leads to unilateral imperialism.</p>
<p>When the formidable voice of moral authority, Paul Craig Roberts, warns about <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/03/14/world-war-1-paul-craig-roberts/">World War 1 All Over Again</a>, the nation must come to grips with the fact that the establishment political class is hell bent on running the world by whatever means they decide as they undertake to eliminate any and all opposition to their brinkmanship of NWO jingoism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Did US Secretary of State John Kerry ask you before he delivered an all or nothing ultimatum to Russia? Did he ask Congress? Did he ask the countries of western and eastern Europe–NATO members who Kerry has committed to whatever the consequences will be of Washington’s inflexible, arrogant, aggressive provocation of Russia, a well-armed nuclear power? Did Kerry ask Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Mexico, South America, Africa, China, Central Asia, all of whom would be adversely affected by a world war provoked by the crazed criminals in Washington?”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Absent from a sober and balanced national policy, on what is truly best for the American people, is recognition that the internationalism fostered by Woodrow Wilson has destroyed the Republic. <a href="http://batr.org/americafirst.html">America First</a> requires the acceptance and courage to admit that the globalist coup d&#8217;état, which actually took over and now rules our own country, is the definitive enemy of all humanity.</p>
<p>The treason of the NeoCons and International Libs promote a satanic cosmology, which seeks to destroy any traditional institutional legacy that George Washington elaborated in his <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp">Farewell Address</a>. Risking World War III over Ukraine, especially when the forces of globalism initiated the unrest, is sheer folly.</p>
<p>If there are any real Patriots left in positions of authority within the Federal government, is it now time to enlist in the much-needed second American Revolution? Liberate our own country before starting conflicts that will only result in an existential demise of our nation. The American holocaust planned from within and exercised by commands from traitors is the real reign of terror that faces every truehearted citizen.</p>
<p>An empire necessitates the elimination of the Republic. If Crimea can hold a referendum, only the NWO Jacobins deny the same option for us.</p>

<p>There Is A Great Risk of WWIII Over Ukraine / Crimea. But it could be avoided if Russia and China act fast, dumping their dollar reserves, breaking the US dollar, thereby breaking the US economy.They don&#8217;t need all of the BRICS for that.</p>
<p>Mr. Putin knows it, Mr. Xi knows it and Mr. Obama knows it &#8211; that Washington is holding the shorter stick.</p>
<p>What do the gentlemen Putin and Xi wait for? </p>
<p>For more brazen actions by Washington and its European lackeys and puppets?</p>
<p>It’s already widely known that the<a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article37929.htm"> snipers in Kiev</a> who killed almost 100 people were mercenaries paid for and were following US orders – straight from the US embassy in Kiev.</p>
<p>Blackwater and other US mercenaries – proxy armies &#8211; are roaming the streets of Kiev and other Ukrainian western cities who have indicated their desire to stay allied with Russia.</p>
<p>Mr. Putin knows it. </p>
<p>What else is needed to show the empire and its marionettes that they are naked? That they will be severely hurt if they follow Obama&#8217;s and the Pentagon’s unconscious war cries? – If they continue to allow the presstitute media to numb their brains?</p>
<p>Why doesn’t Russia start ‘sampling’ what it could do? Like cutting of gas supplies to Europe – for starters? That seems to be easy enough.</p>
<p>Of course, Washington needs wars not only to reach global hegemony, but also for its mickey-mouse economy to survive; this hell-bound military / security industrial economy that produces about 60% of the US GDP – plus the endless production of unbacked dollars not worth the paper they are printed on – debt that is bought the world over in the form of Treasury Bonds as reserve currency – which is the driver of the American economy’s (sic) senseless consumerism – accounting for almost the reminder of US economic output.</p>
<p>What would be easier than to cut the world lose from this strangling chain – and send Washington and its stooges down the drain of national bankruptcy? </p>
<p>And starting a new segment of civilization, a new currency, a basket of moneys from sound and healthy economies? </p>
<p>There are plenty of countries who would like to participate in such a new beginning, even if the BRICS cannot get their act together fast enough &#8212; Vietnam, Malaysia, Iran, Venezuela with the planet’s largest known hydrocarbon reserves – as well as Central Asian and other hydrocarbon producers.</p>
<p>The world populations may have to go through some dry stretches and trying periods – but would come out of it as winners – happy winners of a fairer global economy, where long-lost national sovereignties would be reinstated, with new partnerships and with of a new sense of human and societal solidarity.</p>
<p>Very likely, the presstitute, the propaganda whores of today’s linchpins would want to switch seats to side with the ‘winners’, as they imagine it’s with them that new lucre is waiting.</p>
<p>Wrong. These media criminals, who have millions of lives – or deaths &#8211; on their spineless backs, would be shed, floored, ignored annihilated. </p>
<p>New and truth journalism would flourish, instead.</p>
<p>Why is it so difficult to imagine such a new-born and healthy world? – And act on it fast? &#8211; Before our hapless humanity allows to be self-destroyed by a nuclear WWIII?</p>

<p>When one studies history, all events seem to revolve around the applications and degenerations of war. Great feats of human understanding, realization and enlightenment barely register in the mental footnotes of the average person. War is what we remember, idealize and aggrandize, which is why war is the tool most often exploited by oligarchy to distract the masses while it centralizes power.</p>
<p>With the exception of a few revolutions, most wars are instigated and controlled by financial elites, manipulating governments on both sides of the game to produce a preconceived result. The rise of National Socialism in Germany, for instance, was largely funded by corporate entities based in the U.S., including Rockefeller giant Standard Oil, JPMorgan and even IBM, which built the collating machines specifically used to organize Nazi extermination camps, the same machines <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/mar/29/humanities.highereducation">IBM representatives serviced on site at places like Auschwitz</a>. As a public figure, Adolf Hitler was considered a joke by most people in German society, until, of course, the Nazi Party received incredible levels of corporate investment. This aid was most evident in what came to be known as the Keppler Fund created through the Keppler Circle, a group of interests with contacts largely based in the U.S.</p>
<p>George W. Bush’s grandfather, Prescott Bush, used his position as director of the New York-based Union Banking Corporation to launder money for the Third Reich throughout the war. After being exposed and charged for trading with the enemy, the case against Bush magically disappeared in a puff of smoke, and the Bush family went on to become one of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar" target="_blank">most powerful political forces</a> in America.</p>
<p>Without the aid of international conglomerates and banks, the Third Reich would have never risen to power.</p>
<p>The rise of communism in Russia through the Bolshevik Revolution was no different. As outlined in Professor Antony Sutton’s book <em>Wall Street And The Bolshevik Revolution</em> with vast detail and irrefutable supporting evidence, it was globalist financiers that created the social petri dish in which the communist takeover flourished.  The same financiers that aided the Nazis&#8230;</p>
<p>The two sides, National Socialism and communism, were essentially identical despotic governmental structures conjured by the same group of elites. These two sides, these two fraudulent ideologies, were then pitted against each other in an engineered conflict that we now call World War II, resulting in an estimated 48 million casualties globally and the ultimate formation of the United Nations, a precursor to world government.</p>
<p>Every major international crisis for the past century or more has ended with an even greater consolidation of world power into the hands of the few, and this is no accident.</p>
<p>When I discuss the concept of the false left/right paradigm with people, especially those in the liberty movement, I often see a light turn on, a moment of awareness in their faces. Many of us understand the con game because we live it day to day. We see past the superficial rhetoric of Republican and Democratic party leadership and take note of their numerous similarities, including foreign policy, domestic defense policy and economic policy. The voting records of the major players in both parties are almost identical. One is hard-pressed to find much difference in ideology between Bush and Barack Obama, for example; or Obama and John McCain; or Obama and Mitt Romney, for that matter.</p>
<p>When I suggest, however, that similar false paradigms are used between two apparently opposed nations, the light fades, and people are left dumbstruck. Despite the fact that globalist financiers shoveled capital into the U.S., British, German and Soviet military complexes all at the same time during World War II, many Americans do not want to believe that such a thing could be happening today.</p>
<p>In response, I present the crisis in Ukraine versus the crisis in Syria&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Ukraine Versus Syria</strong></p>
<p>It seems as though much of the public has already forgotten that at the end of 2013, the U.S. came within a razor’s edge of economic disaster — not to mention the possibility of World War III. The war drums in Washington were thundering for “intervention” in Syria and the overthrow of Bashar Assad. The only thing that saved us, I believe, were the tireless efforts of the independent media in exposing the darker motives behind the Syrian insurgency and the bloodlust of the Obama Administration. The problem is that when the elites lose one avenue toward war and distraction, they have a tendency to simply create another. Eventually, the public is so overwhelmed by multiple trigger points and political powder kegs that they lose track of reality. I often call this the “scattergun effect.”</p>
<p>The crisis in the Ukraine is almost a carbon copy of the civil war in Syria, culminating in what I believe to be the exact same intent.</p>
<p><strong>The Money</strong></p>
<p>Money from globalist centers has been flowing into the Ukrainian opposition since at least 2004, when the Carnegie Foundation was caught <a href="http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041211/news_1n11usaid.html" target="_blank">filtering funds</a> to anti-Russian political candidate Viktor Yushchenko, as well as to the groups who supported him.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian Supreme Court called for a runoff due to massive voter fraud and the rise of the pro-Western Orange Revolution, determining the winner to be Yushchenko over none other than Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych went on to win the 2010 elections, and the revolution returned to oust him this year.</p>
<p>It has been discovered that the current revolution has also been receiving funds from NATO and U.S. interests, not just from the State Department, but also from billionaires like <a href="http://pando.com/2014/02/28/pierre-omidyar-co-funded-ukraine-revolution-groups-with-us-government-documents-show/" target="_blank">Pierre Omidyar</a>, the chairman of eBay and the new boss of journalist Glen Greenwald, the same journalist who is now famous for being the first to expose National Security Agency documents obtained by Edward Snowden.</p>
<p>Much of the monetary support from such financiers was being funneled to men like Oleh Rybachuk, the right-hand man to Yanukovych during the Orange Revolution and a favorite of neoconservatives and the State Department in the U.S.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/imf-ready-respond-ukraines-aid-bid-22696497" target="_blank">International Monetary Fund</a> has also jumped at the chance to throw money at the new Ukrainian regime, which would prevent default of the country and allow the opposition movement to focus their attentions on Russia.</p>
<p>The revolution in Syria was also primarily driven by Western funds and arms transferred through training grounds like Benghazi, Libya. There is much evidence to suggest that the<a href="http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2013/08/01/exclusive-dozens-of-cia-operatives-on-the-ground-during-benghazi-attack/" target="_blank">attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi</a> was designed to possibly cover up the arming of Syrian rebels by the CIA, who had agents on the ground who still have not been allowed to testify in front of Congress.</p>
<p>After this conspiracy was exposed in the mainstream, globalist-controlled governments decided to openly supply money and weapons to the Syrian insurgency, instead of ending the subterfuge.</p>
<p><strong>The ‘Rebels’</strong></p>
<p>Some revolutions are quite real in their intent and motivations. But many either become co-opted by elites through financing, or they are created from thin air from the very beginning. Usually, the rebellions that are completely fabricated tend to lean toward extreme zealotry.</p>
<p>The Syrian insurgency is rife with, if not entirely dominated by, men associated with al-Qaida. Governments in the U.S. and Israel continue to support the insurgency despite their open affiliation with a group that is supposedly our greatest enemy. Syrian insurgents have been recorded committing numerous atrocities, including mass execution, the torture of civilians and even the cannibalism of human organs.</p>
<p>The revolution in Ukraine is run primarily by the Svoboda Party, a National Socialist (fascist) organization headed by Oleh Tyahnybok.  Here is a photo of Tyahnybok giving a familiar salute:</p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.alt-market.com/images/stories/tyahnybok.jpg" border="0" /></p>
</div>
<p>So far, the opposition in Ukraine has been mostly careful in avoiding the same insane displays of random violence that plagued the Syrians’ public image. It is important to remember though that mainstream outlets like <em>Reuters</em> went far out of their way in attempts to humanize Syrian al-Qaida. Their methods were exposed only through the vigilance of the independent media. With the fascist Svoboda in power in the Ukraine, I believe it is only a matter of time before we see video reports of similar atrocities, giving Russia a perfect rationalization to use military force.</p>
<p><strong>John McCain?</strong></p>
<p>I am now thoroughly convinced that John McCain is a pasty ghoul of the highest order. He claims to be conservative yet supports almost every action of the Obama Administration. He is constantly defending anti-Constitutional actions by the Federal government, including the Enemy Belligerents Act, which was eventually melded into the National Defense Authorization Act; NSA surveillance of U.S. citizens; and even <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/04/25/schumer-mccain-say-gun-control-bills-will-return/" target="_blank">gun control</a>.</p>
<p>And for some reason, the guy makes appearances like clockwork right before or during major overthrows of existing governments. McCain was in Libya <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/libya-war-sen-john-mccain-visits-libyan-rebels/story?id=13439370" target="_blank">during the coup</a> against Moammar Gadhafi.</p>
<p>McCain showed up to essentially buy off the <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2011/02/tunisia-mccain-meets-leaders-calls-revolution-very-successful.html" target="_blank">rebels in Tunisia</a>.</p>
<p>McCain hung out with <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/05/27/18536111-mccain-slips-into-syria-to-meet-with-rebel-leaders?lite" target="_blank">al-Qaida in Syria</a>.</p>
<p>And, what a surprise, McCain met with the Ukrainian opposition movement just before the overthrow of Viktor Yanukovych.  Here is a photo of McCain giving a speech to the opposition with none other than Neo-Nazi Oleh Tyahnybok standing over his left shoulder.</p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.alt-market.com/images/stories/mccainnazi.jpg" border="0" /></p>
</div>
<p>Why McCain? I have no idea. All I know is, if this guy shows up in your country, take cover.</p>
<p><strong>Russia In The Middle</strong></p>
<p>The great danger in Syria was not necessarily the chance of war with Assad. Rather, it was the chance that a war with Assad would expand into a larger conflagration with Iran and Russia. Russia’s only naval facility in the Mideast is on the coast of Tartus in Syria, and Russia has long-standing economic and political ties to Syria and Iran. Any physical action by the West in the region would have elicited a response from Vladimir Putin. The mainstream argument claims that the threat of Russian intervention scared off Obama, but I believe the only reason war actions were not executed by the White House and the globalists was because they didn’t have even minimal support from the general public. For any war, you need at least a moderate percentage of the population to back your play.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, we find the globalists creating tensions between the West and the East yet again. Russia’s most vital naval base sits in Crimea, an autonomous state tethered to the Ukrainian mainland. Currently, Russia has flooded Crimea with troops in response to the regime change in Ukraine. The new Ukrainian government (backed by NATO) has called this an “invasion” and an act of war, while Western warmongers like McCain and Lindsay Graham spread <a href="http://www.politicususa.com/2014/03/02/lindsey-graham-calls-obama-weak-indecisive-war-russia.html" target="_blank">the propaganda meme</a> that Russia made such a move only because Putin believes the Obama Administration to be “weak.”</p>
<p>Clearly, the idea here is to engineer either high tensions or eventual war between Russia and the United States. Syria failed to produce the desired outcome, so the Ukraine was tapped instead.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Markets And The Dollar At Risk</strong></p>
<p>In Syria, any U.S. led military action would have resulted in the immediate closing of the Straight of Hormuz by Iran, threatening to obstruct up to 30% of global petroleum shipments.  Foreign resentment could have easily led to the abandonment of the U.S. dollar as the petro-currency.  Both China and Russia implied the possibility of an economic response to American intervention, though they did not officially go into specifics.  In all likelihood, the dollar&#8217;s world reserve status would have been damaged irrevocably.</p>
<p>In the Ukraine, the chance of intervention has been countered with VERY specific threats from Russia, including <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/03/03/europes-dependence-on-russian-oil-and-gas-makes-it-hard-to-enact-meaningful-trade-sanctions/">a freeze on natural gas imports to the European Union through Gazprom</a>, which supplies approximately 30% of the EU&#8217;s fuel.  In 2009, a temporary Ukranian pipeline closure led to widespread shortages across Europe.  While some in the mainstream claim that Russia&#8217;s influence over EU energy has &#8220;diminished&#8221; the fact is a loss of 30% of natural gas reserves for an extended period would inflate energy prices wildly and cripple the EU&#8217;s economy.</p>
<p>Another specific reaction given by Russia is the <a href="http://en.ria.ru/business/20140304/188081405/Putin-Adviser-Urges-Dumping-US-Bonds-In-Reaction-to-Sanctions.html">dumping of U.S. treasury bonds</a>.  Russia&#8217;s bond holdings may not seem like much leverage, except for the fact that China has now publicly backed Russian efforts in the Ukraine, just as they backed Russian opposition to U.S. activities in Syria.  A dump of bonds by Russia would invariably be followed by a Chinese dump as well.  In fact, China and Russia have been setting the stage for a global dollar decoupling since at least 2008.   I have been warning for years that globalists and central bankers needed a &#8220;cover event&#8221;, a distraction or scapegoat imposing enough to provide a veil of chaos in which they could then destroy the greenback as the world reserve and usher in a global currency system.  The Ukraine crisis offers yet another opportunity for this plan to unfold.</p>
<p><strong>The False Paradigm And The Globalist Chessboard</strong></p>
<p>So far, I have outlined what appears to be a correspondence of conspiracy between Syria and the Ukraine and how each event has the continued potential to trigger regional conflict, dollar collapse, or world war. But is this conspiracy one-sided? Are only the West and NATO being manipulated by globalists to box in Russia and provoke a conflict? And what do globalists have to gain by sparking such disaster?</p>
<p>As with every other catastrophic fabricated war, the goal is the erasure of sovereign identity while consolidating of economic, political and social power. It is not enough that global financiers dominate the banking industry and own most politicians; they want to transform the public psyche. They want US to ask THEM for global governance. This manufacture of consent is often achieved by pitting two controlled governments against each other and then, in the wake of the tragedy, calling for global unification. The argument is always presented that if we simply abandoned the concept of nation states and reform under a single world body, all war would “disappear.”</p>
<p>The question is whether Russia’s Putin is aware of the plan. Is he a part of it?  Are we seeing repeat theater of a puppet Russia versus a puppet NATO like that witnessed during the Cold War?</p>
<p>What I do know is that Putin has, a number of times in the past, called for global control of the economy through the IMF and the institution of a new global currency using the <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/at-g20-kremlin-to-pitch-new-currency/375364.html" target="_blank">IMF’s Special Drawing Rights (SDR)</a>.</p>
<p>Loans from the IMF are what saved Russia from debt default in the late 1990s. And Putin has recently called for consultations with the IMF concerning Crimea. Remember, this is the same IMF that is <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/content/russia-and-former-soviet-union/putin-seeks-ukraine-financial-aid-consultations-with-imf-g8-337851.html" target="_blank">working to fund his opponents</a> in Western Ukraine.</p>
<p>Bottom line, if you believe in national sovereignty and decentralization of power, Putin is NOT your buddy. Once again, we have the globalists injecting money into both sides of a conflict which could morph into something nightmarish.  Putin wants global economic governance and consolidation under the IMF just as much as the supposedly &#8220;American-run&#8221; IMF wants consolidation.  Global governance of finance and money creation ultimately means global governance of everything else.</p>
<p>Is a war being created through the false paradigm of East versus West in order to pave the road for global government?  Are East/West tensions being exploited as a smokescreen for the final destruction of the dollar&#8217;s world reserve status?  It is hard to say if the Ukraine will be the final trigger; however, the evidence suggests that if a conflict occurs, regardless of who “wins” such a scenario, the IMF comes out on top.</p>
<p>Imagine you are playing a game of chess by yourself. Which side wins at the end of that game: black or white? The answer is it doesn’t matter. You always win when you control both sides.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, January 15, 2014, the highly anticipated Senate Intelligence Committee report on the September 11, 2012 Benghazi attacks that killed four Americans was released. The primary investigative report, including redactions, consists of 42 pages with an additional 16 pages of appendices and another 25 pages of additional “majority views.” While the report validates much of what I’ve written well in advance of media reports, it also appears to be deliberately deficient in a number of critical areas.</p>
<p>The report acknowledges that there were no protests over an obscure internet video at this facility in Benghazi, which was neither an embassy nor a consulate. As I initially exposed, the report confirms on page seven that the Benghazi facility was an undercover CIA compound. It was only somewhat known to be a U.S. asset in the region, but had no U.S. flag flying anywhere on the property, and did not serve any diplomatic operational function as would an embassy or consulate. Therefore, no one “in the know” could reasonably believe or even suspect that this location would be the site of any protests about an obscure internet video. Yet, the deliberate mischaracterization of not only the site of the attacks, but the reason behind them, continued to be shamelessly peddled by the politicians and media alike. It was not only a lie, but a contemptible lie.</p>
<p>The critical issue of the actual function that CIA compound served remains the “third rail” of our elected leaders and their obedient media. The report focuses on accountability for the lack of security and later, the lack of response to a critical incident. However, it fails to address that the U.S., under the direction of Barack Hussein Obama in the Executive branch, and Hillary Rodham Clinton as the Secretary of State, were spearheading a weapons running operation to arm the anti-Assad factions in Syria by way of Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. As I detailed on November 5, 2012, reasonable estimates suggest that between 30-40 million pounds of missiles, guns and even chemical weapons (gas) had been confiscated in Libya and shipped to various prepositioning locations in Turkey and directly into Syria for use by anti-Assad “rebels.”</p>
<p>The function of this compound was far different than the legitimate function of the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli. The compound in Benghazi served as a logistics hub to arrange the crisscrossing supply lines of Gadaffi’s weapons, under the control of Muslim Brotherhood factions, to the Libyan port city of Dernah, the chokepoint of the arsenals. This was appropriately named the “Ho Chi Minh Trail of Muslim Brotherhood supply lines” as referenced in an October 5, 2012 article by Michael Reagan titled “Building on a kernel of truth.”  Despite this exposure, senate and congressional investigators, whose job it is to uncover the truth, still don’t seem willing to ask the correct questions. Why?</p>
<p>While the political pundits and the corporate media will continue to shamelessly play political football with not only the bodies of four dead Americans, but with the future of all Americans and everyone in the West, Obama and his operational staff of globalists will continue to advance the U.S., and the world, on a certain course that will take us headlong into World War III. By not addressing the core issues of the larger agenda, the attention of the American people continues to be held captive by a single act of a larger play. As I’ve written before, the lies are much bigger.</p>
<p>As I have consistently maintained, the attacks in Benghazi were proxy attacks at a nation-state level in response to our arming the anti-Assad terror organizations. They were not the result of an angry protest over an Internet video, although understanding how that video was used provides insight into the role of the CIA and certain other key players in the cover-up. You will find that the video is directly tied to a CIA operation that was to be used as cover at an appropriate moment.</p>
<p>They were also not the result of some false flag operation with plans to kidnap an American ambassador to swap him for the blind sheikh, although kidnapping did played a role in the attacks as I previously detailed. The kidnapping to which I refer, of course, is related to the abduction of seven Iranian-citizen ICRC workers in Benghazi on July 31, 2012. At least that incident earned a footnote in the Senate report. The curiosity regarding the number of attacks on September 11, 2012, combined with the withholding of heavy artillery suggests that the attackers were looking to rescue their compatriots that were held captive until their mysterious release after the attacks.</p>
<p>Even as the merits of this report are debated in the fictional right-left paradigm and the captive press, the agenda for which this CIA compound served continues. The glee shown by former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in October 2011 when she laughed about the murder of Gaddafi and the destabilization of Libya will likely be absent when Assad falls. Syria remains the target of this game of Risk among the globalists.</p>
<p>The recent actions of new Secretary of State John Kerry are as insidious as his predecessor’s, although perhaps not as overt or easily identifiable in this hall of mirrors of Middle East politics. By stating that the U.S. would not militarily intervene in the take-over by al Qaeda and related terror groups of the Al Anbar Province of Iraq, where many Americans died for the ostensible cause of freedom for the Iraqi people, he has given them a green light to open another front against Syria. The opening a front to the southeast of Syria via Iraq is actually one of many contingency plans, as blaming the use of chemical weapons on Assad did not work as planned as enough people saw that for what it was.</p>
<p>As I have written many times, the goal has always been Syria. Now, if someone thinks that the Russians, Iranians and Syrians are going to be fooled about who’s actually behind this proxy eastern front being opened up against Assad, I’d like to ask now, a year-and-a-half later, do you think they were <i>ever</i> fooled about who was behind the arms running operation out of Benghazi and eastern Libya where this all started?  No and HELL NO.  This latest front, just as the first and now failed fronts in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, is all about plausible deniability, or PD as it’s known in the tradecraft. It’s the magic act where sleight of hand and deception rule the day in “the hall of mirrors” that is Mideast politics, a reference again to the aforementioned article written by Michael Reagan.</p>
<p>Syria will not implode and it will not succumb to some rag-tag army of militants. The anti-Assad operation needs Western and external assistance. Putin is aware of our machinations, as are other leaders.  So, when all of this comes unraveled, and it will, look for it to explode eastward into Saudi Arabia, into the Arab sea, north into Iran and all the way to the Strait of Hormuz. And when, not if it does, that attack will not just damage shipping and the free flow of oil into Western markets, it will crush the dollar and with it the hopes and dreams not just of the U.S., but western civilization itself.</p>
<p>If you continue to sleep now America, sleep well. Because when you do wake up, it just might be a long while before you sleep well again. The prematurely darkening sky you see is not just the announcement of evening in America. Those are blustering storm clouds, and the claps of thunder will be along shortly.  And they will most likely be hard to miss.</p>

Anyone who has studied history knows that the life of a nation as well as its citizens can turn on a dime. On November 22, 1963, the fate of the United States took a dramatic turn for the worse. On that fateful day, some very evil forces asserted their absolute control over the country. This is significant because some of these same evil forces, as well as their descendants are actively enslaving America today.</p>
<h2>John Kennedy An Unlikely President</h2>
<p>John Kennedy was never a perfect man and his exploits with many beautiful and often controversial women, such as Ingrid Arvid, Judith Exner and Marilyn Monroe speaks to JFK’s imperfections. In fact, the present day corporate controlled media has continually revealed JFK’s womanizing ways as an attempt to remove any sympathy for the slain President.</p>
<p>JFK had the dubious legacy of being born into a family of very active criminality. His father, the former ambassador to England, stock market insider trader and mafia bootlegger, Joseph Kennedy, used his underworld ties to convince Meyer Lansky as well as key members of the Chicago mafia to steal the Cook County, IL., presidential election of 1960.</p>
<p>Illinois was the ultimate swing state. If JFK had not carried Cook County, Illinois, the presidency would have fallen to Nixon. Nixon was the insider’s choice. As Vice-President, he circumvented Ike and exacerbated the crisis situation in Southeast Asia on behalf of the furtherance of the CIA’s heroin trafficking through the infamous “Golden Triangle”. Nixon was in bed with the military industrial complex as Ike called it in his farewell address. Nixon was subservient to the whims of the Federal Reserve and ran interference for them, often to the chagrin of Ike, who desperately wanted to dump Nixon from the 1956 Republican ticket. Nixon was the elite’s errand boy, however, what the elite did not count on was the dramatic impact that the combination of television and JFK’s personal charm would play in the outcome of the 1960 election.</p>
<p><img alt="nixon jfk debates" src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/11/nixon-jfk-debates.jpg" width="251" height="201" />In the famous Nixon-Kennedy debates, which were simulcast on radio and television, Nixon actually won among radio listeners. However, among the largest audience, the television audience, JFK won hands down and history was changed. JFK’s charismatic appeal was something that the elite had underestimated. The insiders were left to deal with the son of a criminal and most likely they thought they could work with the son of the Adolph Hitler supporting and bootlegging thug.</p>
<h2>JFK Became a Changed Man</h2>
<p>When JFK entered the White House, his party ways came with him, but there would soon be a series of events that would make John Kennedy a changed man. In 1961, the CIA and director Dulles circumvented JFK by launching a secret invasion of Cuba in the Bay of Pigs fiasco. It was only at the last moment did JFK discover the unfolding events in which he refused to provide air cover and the invasion failed on the beach. Kennedy fired Dulles and threatened to break the CIA into a thousand pieces. This even marked the beginning of the bifurcation between JFK and the elite because the CIA had become their errand boy. The elite and their mafia partners desperately wanted Cuba back under their control and JFK blocked their ambitions. The following year, as a result of the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK had another chance to redeem himself in the eyes of the elite and again he failed. It did not matter that JFK had averted WWIII, he failed to put boots on the ground in Cuba and again, the elite and their designs for Cuba were thwarted.</p>
<p><img alt="vietnam protestors" src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/11/vietnam-protestors.jpg" width="275" height="184" />Simultaneous to the events in Cuba, JFK was dragging his feet on Vietnam. He was reluctantly continuing on the path of allowing combat advisers to continue to operate in South Vietnam.</p>
<p>Vietnam was potentially a huge cash cow to the establishment elite. Chrysler Corporation received 90% of all US defense contracts in 1963, mostly in a middleman capacity. Bell Helicopter and Chase Manhattan Bank would reap record profits from the Vietnam War. Unfortunately for the elite, JFK was growing more isolationist. He became a changed man following the Cuban Missile Crisis as this event shook him to his core. He feared putting the US in military situations that could result in another confrontation with the Soviets. In 1963, JFK had announced that he was bringing home all combat advisers in 1965. JFK and South Vietnamese President, Diem, agreed that America would never send ground troops to Vietnam. Diem and his brother were assassinated by the CIA and 21 days later, JFK was dead. Nine months following these assassinations, America sent 100,000 ground troops to South Vietnam following the now discredited Gulf of Tonkin incident and the elite bathed in their blood money.</p>
<p>JFK had been so shaken by the real possibility of WWIII, that he and the Soviet Premier were actually having discussions regarding the capping of nuclear arms production. The elite could not have any part of  this unprofitable course of action. There is no money to be made in peace especially if you are Martin Marietta (today known as Martin Lockheed). The establishment elite wanted to continue down the path arming America’s nuclear arsenal to the teeth. JFK had become a major impediment to profits in this regard.</p>
<h2>The Changed Man Takes Center Stage</h2>
<p>JFK, no doubt motivated by the fear of WWIII, was blocking Vietnam and was going to kill the cash cow of nuclear arms production. No doubt, JFK saw the establishment elite as the enemy of humanity. They were willing to take the country to war so that they could fatten their wallets.</p>
<p>JFK began to take action against the elite. He was taking away half of their unwarranted oil depletion allowance. JFK stuck a big stick in the eye of the Federal Reserve by printing over $4 billion dollars of silver backed money, thus threatening the stranglehold the Federal Reserve had enjoyed over the country for the past 50 years.</p>
<p>JFK began making speeches, very damning speeches, in which he called out the establishment elite and their “secret societies” and then JFK signed his death warrant with his American University speech in which he announced, among other things, a desire to pursue peace with the Soviets. Once again, there is no money in peace.</p>
<p>On behalf of “the greater good”, JFK had to be eliminated and he was. However, I have often wondered if JFK had survived, how would America have been changed.</p>
<h2>If JFK Had Lived</h2>
<p><img alt="jfk plot" src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/11/jfk-plot.jpg" width="285" height="177" /><br />
If JFK had lived, so too, would have 58,000 Americans and untold millions of Vietnamese. If JFK had lived, we would not have spent two trillion dollars on nuclear arms. The money could have been spent, as JFK suggested, on education. America might not have become the hopelessly dumbed down nation that it has become. If JFK had lived the Federal Reserve would have eventually gone the way of the two previous central banks in the United States. The US Congress would have retaken the constitutional power of coining money, interest free money. America would have remained solvent.</p>
<p>If JFK had lived, he would have continued to confront the oil companies and today, we might have achieved energy independence and could be paying about a buck for a gallon if gas. Alaska would be the new Middle East and the petrodollar, which threatens to plunge us into a world war over Syria and Iran, would no longer be a problem. The world would be coming to the US for its energy needs and our economy would be booming.</p>
<p>If JFK had lived, the people would have had their true representative in the White House. The events in Cuba so changed John Kennedy, that he became a true Ron Paul in the last two years of his life. It was the last time, that anyone, outside the elite establishment, had anyone in top level government that cared for them.</p>
<p>The day that John Kennedy died, November 22, 1963, was the beginning of the end for America. These same forces, the interlocking directorates of the military industrial complex, the Federal Reserve, the major oil companies and the media that they control, continued to suck the life out of America to the point of where we stand today, a shell of our former country.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If in the last year of JFK’s presidency, he hadn’t offered such hope to the American people and to the future of the country, I would have lost interest in the life of JFK and his subsequent assassination a long time ago.</p>
<p>I falsely held out the hope that the 50th Anniversary of his death would rekindle a curiosity about who killed JFK and why and then subsequently link that knowledge into today’s America. This could have been the impetus for change in America. Alas, the elite controlled the narrative this fall with plethora of documentaries which lead away from the truth that there was a conspiracy to kill JFK. As a result, the country’s interest will continue to wane and with it, the belief that JFK was killed as a result of a conspiracy.</p>
<p>In 1993, 80% of the country believed that JFK was killed as the result of a conspiracy. With the rash of media propaganda, that number has reduced to 61%. The elite have weathered the storm and continue unabated on their journey towards sucking the life out of this country. They will continue to do so until there is nothing left and we are thrown onto the junk pile of history.</p>
<p>There will be no 51st anniversary recognition as the JFK researchers have approached their twilight. Soon the JFK assassination will carry the same weight as the assassination of McKinley. Who? That’s my point. The King is dead, long live the King.</p>
<p><img alt="jfk" src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/11/jfk.jpg" width="217" height="232" />On November 23rd, as we turn our collective eyes back on our future, we might want to begin to prepare for adaptation for there will be no great awakening because your future and your very lives are being threatened by forces that John Kennedy foresaw over 50 years ago in his “Secret Societies” speech.</p>

<p><i>First and foremost we should be governed by common sense. </i><i>~ </i>Vladimir Putin (<a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/0,28804,1690753_1690757_1695787-3,00.html" target="_blank">Time Magazine</a>, 2007)</p>
<p>President Vladimir Putin is audaciously attempting to remove the brush covering from atop the common sense rabbit hole, which is not only a truly rare and subversive act in the eyes of the Con, but a potentially great gift to humanity – if only humanity had the sensitivity to appreciate it.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this will no doubt prove to be a thrilling ride for those willing to take up the challenge. Russians are fortunate to have such a sane leader, and the West would be wise to follow his lead, but what exactly does Mr. Putin mean by Common Sense?</p>
<p>Here’s a quick peek at a couple of dictionary definitions:</p>
<p><i>1)     </i><i>Sound judgment not based on specialized knowledge; native good judgment.</i></p>
<p><i>2)     </i><i>The basic ability to </i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception" target="_blank"><i>perceive</i><i>,</i></a><i> </i><a title="Nous" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nous" target="_blank"><i>understand</i></a><i>, and</i><i> </i><a title="Phronesis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phronesis" target="_blank"><i>judge</i></a><i> things.</i></p>
<p>The ability to soundly judge is important to understanding what common sense is all about, as is the fact that judgment is not an isolated act made according to individuated, specialized knowledge, but of something that is of a more general nature that is shared, common or native to the species as a whole.</p>
<p>To better understand how common sense operates as a cognitive process, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=Aristotle&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">Aristotle</a> provides a clear and useful description:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The reason for having several senses is in fact that it increases the chances that we can distinguish and recognize things correctly.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense#cite_note-11" target="_blank"><sup>]</sup></a> Each sense is used to identify distinctions, such as sight identifying the difference between black and white, but, says Aristotle, all animals with perception must have “some one thing” which can distinguish black from sweet.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense#cite_note-12" target="_blank"><sup>]</sup></a> </em></p>
<p>see section on “Aristotelian Common Sense” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense</a></p></blockquote>
<p>This shared or <i>common</i> sense, as opposed to a two-step Stimulus-Response model, appears to operate, according to Aristotle’s description, as a three-step process:</p>
<p>A) Perception</p>
<p>B) Understanding (through comparative analysis)</p>
<p>C) Judgment</p>
<p>Why is something as fundamental and basic to humanity’s existence operating according to a three-step rather than two-step process?</p>
<p>If you look around the world today, everything is presented in opposing, pairs: A-B. Not A-B-C.</p>
<p>As such, critical A-B-C thinking, <i>aka</i> Common Sense is fundamental to <a title="Humanity is Waking Up to the Intelligence of Nature" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/10/02/humanity-waking-intelligence-nature/">the evolution of awareness</a>, consciousness, cooperation and love which seems to occur with great frequency in nature, but not nearly as much in most human societies.</p>
<p>The Con understands this reality quite well, and they exploit it to their benefit. The Con does everything it can to lock humanity into a system characterized by dualism, stimulus-response programming, isolation, separation, competition, narcissism and egotism.</p>
<p>According to Aristotle’s logic, while each individual is inseparable from the whole, without common sense,<i>i.e.</i> a shared vision of the whole, perception of reality is too narrow, distorted and false.</p>
<p>Aristotle also said:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Common sense is where comparison happens, and this must occur by comparing impressions or symbols or markers of what the specialist senses have perceived. This is therefore also where </i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness" target="_blank"><i>consciousness</i></a><i> </i><i>originates, “for it makes us aware of having sensations at all”</i><i></i></p>
<p>see section on “Aristotelian Common Sense” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Aristotle emphasizes the act of comparison as critical to Understanding (Step B) the three-step A-B-C Common Sense-making process.</p>
<p>After perceiving an object, the perceiver compares and contrasts that object in relation to similar objects found within the perceiver’s experience. Finally, based on that understanding, the perceiver, in a creative act of synthesis, finds the true center or third way derived from the act of comparison and projects that decision out into the world.</p>
<p>In 2006, after carefully analyzing and deconstructing Vladimir Putin’s year 2000 Millennium Manifesto, author Gavin Slade from the Central European University in Budapest, an affiliate of The School of Russian and Asian Studies (SRAS), affirms the Russian leader’s propensity for utilizing in the political arena the type of Hegelian common sense widely discussed in this article:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>In the 1990s Russia’s political discourse was framed in terms of good and evil. There was little compromise or synthesis.</i></p>
<p><i>The rejection of revolution and change shows that Putin is effectively trying to establish a discourse focused on unity and stability knowing that the binary oppositions of politics during the Yeltsin era had created a situation where the state was unable “to muster a critical mass of leaders who articulate[d] one or another political discourse that resonate[d] in political society.</i><i></i></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sras.org/deconstructing_the_millennium_manifesto" target="_blank">http://www.sras.org/deconstructing_the_millennium_manifesto</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Rare among today’s world leaders, Vladimir Putin appears to well understand the evolutionary necessity of this <i>third way</i> approach to governance based on common sense-derived synthesis, and leverages that knowledge to promote unity, social cohesion and commonality of purpose on a national and international scale.</p>
<div><img src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/Putin-on-horse3.jpg" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p>Aristotle even goes as far as to say that <a title="How Enlightenment is the Process of Creation in the Universe in Reverse" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/05/16/how-enlightenment-is-the-process-of-creation-in-the-universe-in-reverse/">common sense is where consciousness originates</a>. So if a society is lacking in common sense, and there’s little to no conscience, morality, empathy, consciousness, creativity, taste, discernment or love, how does one propose to govern such a population? This no doubt created a quandary for the rulers of large populations in the past, and clearly still presents governance challenges today.</p>
<p>The system’s time-honored, traditional answer to the problem of populations lacking in common sense was to oppress them into submission, with increased submission leading to an ever more constrictive cycle of dominance, oppression and abuse. It’s not outrageous to consider both parties to be at fault for this social dynamic that still exists and thrives today.</p>
<p>The cognitive process of common sense is part of humanity’s spiritual endowment and is similar to the Greek idea of knowledge or <i>nous</i>, which is the <i>divine spark or knowledge within</i> that is shared or common to all.</p>
<p>While <i>nous</i> may be common to all, it seems at present to be buried deep within the human psyche, and as such, unfortunately, is largely inactive.</p>
<p>Humanity’s drive to separate, exceptionalize and specialize (such groveling at the feet of society’s beloved specialists), is but a tiny sliver of the whole spoon-fed matrix. These absurd, <a title="Evolving Planetary Consciousness to Escape Self-Destruction" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/08/20/evolving-planetary-consciousness-to-escape-self-destruction/">self-destructive values</a> are automatically downloaded at face value and parroted aloud as that which <i>everybody knows</i>.</p>
<p>These automatic, pre-programmed responses demonstrate the process of individual and social decay which epitomizes dualistic A-B programming, and as such represents an evolutionary dead-end. And yet despite its flaws, this system, while abhorrent to many not only does have value in populations largely lacking in common sense, but also provides stark contrast to utopian social visions, as well as important motivation for those who wish to overcome its glaring inadequacies.</p>
<p>So cheer up, the news is not entirely bleak. To find oneself, one must first lose oneself, and so humanity has intentionally (if not consciously), led itself astray. The capacity for auto-correction is built into the natural system of the Earth and undoubtedly woven into the very fabric of cosmic existence itself. And yet in order to auto-correct, one must first dare to walk down dark paths leading to destinations unknown.</p>
<p>Compliance with Globalist diktat is ensured by the Con’s ability to provide endless streams of mindless distractions and short-term pleasures quick as you can afford them. And if you can’t afford them but still crave them, you get a gold star for being a motivated world citizen.</p>
<p>But try inducing people to step off that wheel, swallow the red pill and slide down the rabbit hole. Just see how that works out.</p>
<p>Of course this makes no sense. Why choose isolated, short-term pleasures over long-term ones? Freedom is sold cheap in exchange for a handful of trinkets and beads. But as the late great <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=George%20Carlin&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">George Carlin</a> once said: “nobody seems to notice; nobody seems to care.”</p>
<p>The average person, lacking common sense, is unable to step outside his bubble and recognize the divinely entangled oneness of reality.</p>
<p>How many times do you have to read in the alternative media about the daunting lack of empathy on the part of the Globalist controllers, and this is true, but how about the lack of empathy among the masses? Without common sense, there is no empathy, and the masses are sorely lacking in common sense.</p>
<p>The inability to put themselves in the shoes of others keeps the un-awoken strapped to the bed of their own egotistical, narcissism. Good luck getting through to them. They are simply incapable of being awakened in anything less than a repeatedly rough manner.</p>
<p>Russian history is chock-full of examples of these rough awakenings, and it therefore should not be so surprising that today’s Russian population is relatively more awake than those still snoozing in the pampered, declining West.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why those cast in <a title="The Age of Confusion – Mass Manipulation, Propaganda and Frequency Prisons" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/09/20/age-confusion-mass-manipulation-propaganda-frequency-prisons/">the role of Controllers</a> – along with their robotic minions – are as nasty and brutish as they are, since it falls on them to rouse Joe Sixpack in the only way he seems to understand: by shoving his face deep down into the toilet bowl of an unexamined life. Spend enough time down there, and you may finally see that all your dreams of wealth, success and material gain have just been so much meaningless crap.</p>
<p>And so the seemingly endless stream of futile chatter in the alternative media referring to the slumbering masses and how if they just had the right information is, sorry to say, nothing but pure fantasy, wishful thinking and projection on the part of the awakened, common sense minority.</p>
<p>The<em> Great Awakening</em> that many feel today, and it is palpable, is not widespread; it’s actually emanating from a very small, scattered fraction of the global population. It’s just that this small but slowly growing group of A-B-C common sense types, specialists in their own right, have a tendency, despite their incessant utilization of the common sense process, largely due to a lifetime of incessant “all men are created equal” propaganda, to erroneously project their common sense values on to the masses, and as a result are time and time again disappointed when their best intentions to rouse the herd are not taken seriously. Boo-hoo.</p>
<p>If the world was in fact brimming over with common sense, which currently it is not, reality would appear quite different than it does. No, the prison planet has been specially designed to serve the masochistic masses precisely what they need in order to evolve. It wouldn’t actually be so bad if it weren’t so damn destructive. If anything, it’s not dull.</p>
<p>As it is presented today, the Con’s “reality” is designed to stroke the mass ego consciousness with just enough happy endings to keep the machine humming and its occasionally unruly parts alternately motivated, sedated and restrained. This seems to be an unfortunate yet necessary design for an emotionally immature, Id-raging majority.</p>
<p>On the other hand, within an awakened community, no matter how small, which is not characterized by delusion but common sense, the rules of the game could not be more different. Within such a community, you can always choose another path and consciously create what you want. Life there is no longer an either/or A-B equation. You can finally transcend childish dualism as you take a quantum leap into the common sense adult world of contemplation, awareness, empathy, consciousness, comparative analysis, and synthesis. In this vitally thrilling world, A + B = C.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The goal of discourse is to create the transcendental, a higher centre of meaning outside the plurality of visions and interpretations, ‘to arrest the flow of differences, to construct a centre. ‘Thus, ‘at the base of Putin’s policies and what we shall describe as his “third way” lies the idea of a grand transcendence of so many of the conflicts that had both shaped and torn Russia in the modern era.’ -</i><a href="http://www.sras.org/deconstructing_the_millennium_manifesto" target="_blank">http://www.sras.org/deconstructing_the_millennium_manifesto</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Putin has tirelessly and with increasing success preached his neo-Gnostic common sense gospel to a Russian population that has in the not-so-distant past become familiar on an unprecedented scale with such intense suffering and pain that an increasingly large portion of them now appear eager to listen to and act upon Putin’s challenge to reclaim their common heritage as intelligent, discerning and consciously evolving individuals in a country of rich heritage and national achievement. This development on a national scale is uncommon.</p>
<p>The economic prosperity that Putin’s leadership has helped generate, impressive as it is, pales in comparison to the raising of individual consciousness <i>en masse</i> in Russia, which is what can happen to a nation when real common sense is applied to governance. That requires rare leadership qualities on a level that few in other countries have experienced in a long while.</p>
<p>What many in the West often fail to comprehend (because they lack empathy) is that when you’re the leader of a 9 time zone wide, 17 million square kilometer (6.6 million sq mi) Eurasian land mass comprised of a wide range of European, Caucasian, Asian and Indigenous cultures, in order to successfully lead and inspire such a diverse group, you must possess a Yin Yang-balanced, personal and diplomatic Swiss Army-like skill-set.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>This mixing of Western and Russian ideas is only a part of a blend of inter-discursive features adopted by Putin. It is in his co-optation of different discourses and ideas that Putin attempts to suture rifts in identity and win the war of position within discourse. It is, as some have said, a ‘third way.’</i></p>

<p>As an individual, Vladimir Putin displays many attributes of the modern Renaissance Man. He’s a vigorous yet contemplative gentleman of refinement and culture with an admiration for various art forms and a genuine appreciation for the diverse beauty and splendor of nature.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Putin enjoys hunting and fishing, it’s not part of some macho power trip to defeat and kill defenseless animals, but rather as a way for him to feel vitally connected to the natural world that we share with each other and are invited to explore if only we dare.</p>
<p>Here’s a striking passage from a May, 2011 Outdoor Life Magazine interview where Mr. Putin candidly describes his experience obtaining a whale biopsy:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><i>OL:</i></strong><i> </i><i>In August 2010, you helped scientists obtain skin samples from a whale off Russia’s Pacific Coast by darting one with a crossbow. I imagine that has to be one of the more incredible of your wildlife encounters.</i></p>
<p><em><b>VP:</b></em><i> </i><i>That was indeed an unforgettable experience, and I remember very well how impressed I was.</i></p>
<p><i>First, all that surrounded me—the low sky, the stormy sea and, of course, the whales—was magnificent. Besides, these elegant giants showed us a real performance, leaping out of the water in front of our boat.</i></p>
<p><i>Second, I was really thrilled. I do not want to offend your feelings as a hunter, but, by its intensity, its dynamics, that was a real hunt. But without killing the animal. And this was a special pleasure. This is not a melodramatic statement. That’s the way it really was.</i></p>
<p><i>We left not just to see the whales, but to take a biopsy—in other words, to dart one of the animals with a crossbow arrow, which can rip off a small part of whale skin necessary to make a special analysis. It was not that easy; three times I failed, and only the fourth attempt was successful. Of course, I could justify myself that the boat was tossing badly and that it was the first time for me to handle a crossbow, but the main reason I see was my anxiety, because participation in the scientific experiment is a very important undertaking.</i></p>
<p><em><b>OL:</b></em><i> </i><i>After you successfully darted a whale, a reporter asked you if it was dangerous. You replied that, “Living, in general, is dangerous.” Do you have any comment on that?</i></p>
<p><em><b>VP:</b></em><i> </i><i>I think what I meant by that is obvious. Despite all the achievements of civilization, the human being is still one of the most vulnerable creatures on earth. None of us is protected from crimes, epidemic outbreaks, natural and technogenic disasters. What I am saying is not a fatalistic view of the world, it is a realistic one.</i></p>
<p><a href="http://www.outdoorlife.com/articles/hunting/2011/05/one-one-vladimir-putin?page=0%2C4" target="_blank">http://www.outdoorlife.com/articles/hunting/2011/05/one-one-vladimir-putin?page=0%2C4</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Putin, with obvious empathy for the whale and a humble appreciation for the magnitude of the moment, describes in a nutshell the fragility of the human experience within a natural world that is both nurturing and fraught with risk. Unlike his ego-driven political counterparts who can never admit to any weakness, it’s a feather in his cap that he does not appear to be afraid to convey his fear and anxiety at being in the middle of what most would agree was an unsafe situation.</p>
<p>Mr. Putin seems to be implying that you might as well take risks because risk is inherent to life. To therefore feel some degree of anxiety when taking bold steps is natural, and nothing to be afraid of. Taking those bold steps is part of a personal and national awakening process.</p>

<p>…it should come as no surprise when Mr. Putin applies a calculated risk approach to diplomacy, as demonstrated by his swift response to an extraordinary early August 2013 meeting with the head of Saudi intelligence, Prince Bandar, an event first reported in the UK Telegraph and widely acknowledged in the Russian press as well as a number of other sources.</p>

<p>This colorful September 30<sup>th</sup>, 2013 recapitulation of that same fateful meeting comes courtesy of an approving Pravda opinion column, “Come the Day, Come The Hour”:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Essentially, Bandar Bush went to Putin – purportedly with the full backing of the US, and offered to cut a secret deal to carve up the oil profits if Russia would back off on Syria and allow a regime change. Putin quietly and politely offered a nyet. He was not for sale and neither were his principles. Bandar went on to then threaten Russia by turning loose Chechen terrorists to cause havoc in the Winter Sochi Olympics. Saying that all terrorists groups are under their control and that they can turn them on or off as they like. Well, it appears that at this stage, the negotiations moved from being polite – Putin warned Bandar that if Syria is attacked, Russia would bomb Saudi Arabia. At last, someone with balls. This threat was communicated to senior members of the Armed Forces with instructions to prepare to strike Saudi Arabia. Obviously, this was leaked.</i></p>
<p><a href="http://english.pravda.ru/opinion/columnists/17-09-2013/125685-president_putin-0/" target="_blank">http://english.pravda.ru/opinion/columnists/17-09-2013/125685-president_putin-0/</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The now famous and universally acclaimed accord on chemical weapons aside, wouldn’t it be more than likely that President Putin’s declaration of intent to bomb Saudi Arabia if Syria was attacked is the real, under-reported reason why a near-certain <a title="Media Head Games Exposed! CNN Caught Using Neuro-Linguistic Programming to Influence Syrian Conflict" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/08/30/media-head-games-exposed-cnn-caught-using-neuro-linguistic-programming-to-influence-syrian-conflict/">U.S. strike on Syria</a> was called off? Just a theory…</p>
<p>President Putin, a man of principle and a strong advocate of International Law, rejected out of hand Bandar’s pathetic bribe, since unlike many other politicians, he has principles, and can’t just be bought off.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, upon digesting Prince Bandar’s incredible admission of he and his country’s direct support for state-sponsored terrorism, despite his usual placid demeanor, President Putin’s jaw must have dropped when he received a not-so-thinly veiled threat of Olympic terrorist attack if cooperation on the Syria question was not forthcoming. President Putin rightly determined that this was not only a direct threat to Russia, but to the entire civilized world, and so he did what he had to do: stand up to the bully.</p>
<p>Only a leader so level-headed and eminently comfortable in his own skin could stare the impudent Saudi down and call his bluff in terms that were crystal clear and absolutely appropriate to the threat. Exercising his capacity for A-B-C common sense, Mr. Putin perceived, understood and decided what to do without hesitation.</p>
<p>When threatened with force, sometimes the only way to get the other party to take you seriously is to threaten them right back. That took guts and is deserving of recognition.</p>
<p>World War III was averted (for now), and Putin’s stock has deservedly risen to such a high level around the world that he was in serious contention for the Nobel Prize. The fact that he didn’t win is probably better PR than if he had won, since Obama won it for bailing out the bankers. Putin is probably ok then with an honorable mention.</p>
<p>When an individual like Vladimir Putin, who both at home and abroad is recognized as having an authentic character, repeatedly demonstrates sane, balanced actions, as he declares the rule of law and common sense governance as the goals of the nation and backs it up with corresponding actions, he naturally enjoys widespread support and trust.</p>
<p>Sadly, these common sense leadership qualities, which should be essential prerequisites for every political leader, are sorely lacking in the West, where there seems to be a permanent disconnect between common sense and politics.</p>
<p>Often unfairly lampooned in the press for his bare-chested macho man image, Mr. Putin also appears to genuinely be in touch with his feminine side.</p>
<p><img src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/putin-judo3.jpg" alt="" />As a Judo master, Putin is adept at using his opponents’ momentum against them, which can only be done by respecting the power of each “adversary,” as well as being sensitive to the flow of energy emanating from that person. A perfect example of a real world application of that principle is how President Putin “flipped” and redirected the Saudi Prince’s malevolent, threatening, violent energy right back at the Prince and synthesized the product of that energy for the purpose of creating peace.</p>
<p>Check out Putin’s judo moves here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtDQ_t-_HQ" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtDQ_t-_HQ</a></p>
<p>Sometimes Presidents really do need to act like car salesmen, but the car that Putin is selling is built to last and runs efficiently on common sense, common law (<i>i.e.</i> as long as you’re not hurting anyone, you’re acting within the law), and community. And that’s a vehicle more and more Russian citizens are being convinced by Putin to buy, since he drives one himself.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Putin’s manifesto is rich in inter-discursivity, appropriating elements from competing ideologies and rejecting binary oppositions in order to win the war of position within the discursive field thus creating ‘an all-national spiritual reference point that will help to consolidate society, thereby strengthening the state. This reference point, a new Russian idea, helps construct an image of the state as a nation of people represented by a spokesperson, the president.</i></p>

<p>Those of the awakened minority who are frustrated and at odds with Globalist domination strategies should find solace in the fact that the dream of a New World Order, of which much of the world is presently dreaming into reality, must according to its unnatural and unsustainable underlying principles, much like its Soviet system predecessor, inevitably collapse under the weight of its excessive absurdity.</p>
<p>And if you’re one of the small but proud members of the common sense minority community, if you haven’t already done so, please do yourselves a big favor and cease all efforts aimed at trying to wake up humanity, because it can’t be done. Instead, continue waking yourselves up.</p>
<p>Humanity can only wake itself up one individual at a time. The newly awakened, in their own time, will make connections with others without your incessant nudges. So try to let go. You’ll feel better if you do.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to the West’s current political downward slope, it’s fascinating to observe the progress of Vladimir Putin in his quest to help instill and nurture a <a title="The War on Drugs and The War on Consciousness" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/01/21/the-war-on-drugs-and-the-war-on-consciousness/">return of common sense to the realm of politics</a>. It makes one hopeful that new <a title="7 Things Outstanding Leaders Do Differently" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/10/09/7-things-outstanding-leaders-differently/" target="_blank">leadership</a> possessing similar strength of character will follow President Putin’s lead.</p>
<p>Unlike Mr. Putin, we can’t all play the part of hero in this movie, although there’s no character too minor and no act too small.</p>
<p>Continue speaking your truth, get along with others, and have a good time. The rest will take care of itself.</p>
<p>That’s just plain old common sense.</p>
<p>And to close the show, Ladies and Gentlemen and Children of all ages, live from the internet, the one, the only…:</p>

			<p>A talk at Rhodes Forum, October 5, 2013&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/putin-obama-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/putin-obama-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>First, the good news. American hegemony is over. The bully has been subdued. We cleared the Cape of Good Hope, symbolically speaking, in September 2013. With the Syrian crisis, the world has passed a key forking of modern history. It was touch and go, just as risky as the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. The chances for total war were high, as the steely wills of America and Eurasia had crossed in the Eastern Mediterranean. It will take some time until the realisation of what we’ve gone through seeps in: it is normal for events of such magnitude. The turmoil in the US, from the mad car chase in the DC to the shutdown of federal government and possible debt default, are the direct consequences of this event.</p>
<p> Remember the Berlin Wall? When it went down, I was in Moscow, writing for Haaretz. I went to a press-conference with Politburo members in the President Hotel, and asked them whether they concurred that the end of the USSR and world socialist system was nigh. I was laughed at; it was an embarrassing occasion. Oh no, they said. Socialism will blossom, as the result of the Wall’s fall. The USSR went down two years later. Now our memory has compacted those years into a brief sequence, but in reality, it took some time.</p>
<p> The most dramatic event of September 2013 was the high-noon stand-off near the Levantine shore, with five US destroyers pointing their Tomahawks towards Damascus and facing them &#8211; the Russian flotilla of eleven ships led by the carrier-killer Missile Cruiser Moskva and supported by Chinese warships. Apparently, two missiles were launched towards the Syrian coast, and both failed to reach their destination.</p>
<p> It was claimed by a Lebanese newspaper quoting diplomatic sources that the missiles were launched from a NATO air base in Spain and they were shot down by the Russian ship-based sea-to-air defence system. Another explanation proposed by the Asia Times says the Russians employed their cheap and powerful GPS jammers to render the expensive Tomahawks helpless, by disorienting them and causing them to fail. Yet another version attributed the launch to the Israelis, whether they were trying to jump-start the shoot-out or just observed the clouds, as they claim.</p>
<p> Whatever the reason, after this strange incident, the pending shoot-out did not commence, as President Obama stood down and holstered his guns. This was preceded by an unexpected vote in the British Parliament. This venerable body declined the honour of joining the attack proposed by the US. This was the first time in two hundred years that the British parliament voted down a sensible proposition to start a war; usually the Brits can’t resist the temptation.</p>
<p> After that, President Obama decided to pass the hot potato to the Congress. He was unwilling to unleash Armageddon on his own. Thus the name of action was lost. Congress did not want to go to war with unpredictable consequences. Obama tried to browbeat Putin at the 20G meeting in St Petersburg, and failed. The Russian proposal to remove Syrian chemical weaponry allowed President Obama to save face. This misadventure put paid to American hegemony , supremacy and exceptionalism. Manifest Destiny was over. We all learned that from Hollywood flics: the hero never stands down; he draws and shoots! If he holsters his guns, he is not a hero: he’s chickened out.</p>
<p> Afterwards, things began to unravel fast. The US President had a chat with the new president of Iran, to the chagrin of Tel Aviv. The Free Syrian Army rebels decided to talk to Assad after two years of fighting him, and their delegation arrived in Damascus, leaving the Islamic extremists high and dry. Their supporter Qatar is collapsing overextended. The shutdown of their government and possible debt default gave the Americans something real to worry about. With the end of US hegemony, the days of the dollar as the world reserve currency are numbered.</p>
<p> World War III almost occurred as the banksters wished it. They have too many debts, including the unsustainable foreign debt of the US. If those Tomahawks had flown, the banksters could have claimed Force Majeure and disavow the debt. Millions of people would die, but billions of dollars would be safe in the vaults of JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. In September, the world crossed this bifurcation point safely, as President Obama refused to take the fall for the banksters. Perhaps he deserved his Nobel peace prize, after all.</p>
<p> The near future is full of troubles but none are fatal. The US will lose its emission rights as a source of income. The US dollar will cease to serve as the world reserve currency though it will remain the North American currency. Other parts of the world will resort to their euro, yuan, rouble, bolivar, or dinar. The US military expenditure will have to be slashed to normal, and this elimination of overseas bases and weaponry will allow the US population to make the transition rather painlessly. Nobody wants to go after America; the world just got tired of them riding shotgun all over the place. The US will have to find new employment for so many bankers, jailers, soldiers, even politicians.</p>
<p> As I stayed in Moscow during the crisis, I observed these developments as they were seen by Russians. Putin and Russia have been relentlessly hard-pressed for quite a while.</p>
<ul>
<li>The US supported and subsidised Russia’s liberal and nationalist opposition; the national elections in Russia were presented as one big fraud. The Russian government was delegitimised to some extent.</li>
<li>The Magnitsky Act of the US Congress authorised the US authorities to arrest and seize the assets of any Russian they deem is up to no good, without a recourse to a court.</li>
<li>Some Russian state assets were seized in Cyprus where the banks were in trouble.</li>
<li>The US encouraged Pussy Riot, gay parades etc. in Moscow, in order to promote an image of Putin the dictator, enemy of freedom and gay-hater in the Western and Russian oligarch-owned media.</li>
<li>Russian support for Syria was criticised, ridiculed and presented as a brutal act devoid of humanity. At the same time, Western media pundits expressed certainty that Russia would give up on Syria.</li>
</ul>
<p> As I wrote previously, Russia had no intention to surrender Syria, for a number of good reasons: it was an ally; the Syrian Orthodox Christians trusted Russia; geopolitically the war was getting too close to Russian borders. But the main reason was Russia’s annoyance with American high-handedness. The Russians felt that such important decisions should be taken by the international community, meaning the UN Security Council. They did not appreciate the US assuming the role of world arbiter.</p>
<p> In the 1990s, Russia was very weak, and could not effectively object, but  they felt bitter when Yugoslavia was bombed and NATO troops moved eastwards breaking the US promise to Gorbachev. The Libyan tragedy was another crucial point. That unhappy country was bombed by NATO, and eventually disintegrated. From the most prosperous African state it was converted into most miserable. Russian presence in Libya was rather limited, but still, Russia lost some investment there. Russia abstained in the vote on Libya as this was the position of the then Russian president Dmitry Medvedev who believed in playing ball with the West. In no way was Putin ready to abandon Syria to the same fate.</p>
<p> The Russian rebellion against the US hegemony began in June, when the Aeroflot flight from Beijing carrying Ed Snowden landed in Moscow. Americans pushed every button they could think of to get him back. They activated the full spectre of their agents in Russia. Only a few voices, including that of your truly, called on Russia to provide Snowden with safe refuge, but our voices prevailed. Despite the US pressure, Snowden was granted asylum.</p>
<p> The next step was the Syrian escalation. I do not want to go into the details of the alleged chemical attack. In the Russian view, there was not and could not be any reason for the US to act unilaterally in Syria or anywhere else. In a way, the Russians have restored the Law of Nations to its old revered place. The world has become a better and safer place.</p>
<p> None of this could’ve been achieved without the support of China. The Asian giant considers Russia its “elder sister” and relies upon her ability to deal with the round-eyes. The Chinese, in their quiet and unassuming way, played along with Putin. They passed Snowden to Moscow. They vetoed anti-Syrian drafts in the UNSC, and sent their warships to the Med. That is why Putin stood the ground not only for Russia, but for the whole mass of Eurasia.</p>
<p> There were many exciting and thrilling moments in the Syrian saga, enough to fill volumes. An early attempt to subdue Putin at G8 meeting in Ireland was one of them. Putin was about to meet with the united front of the West, but he managed to turn some of them to his side, and he sowed the seeds of doubt in others’ hearts by reminding them of the Syrian rebel manflesh-eating chieftains.   </p>
<p> The proposal to eliminate Syrian chemical weapons was deftly introduced; the UNSC resolution blocked the possibility of attacking Syria under cover of Chapter Seven. Miraculously, the Russians won in this mighty tug-of-war. The alternative was dire: Syria would be destroyed as Libya was; a subsequent Israeli-American attack on Iran was unavoidable; Oriental Christianity would lose its cradle; Europe would be flooded by millions of refugees; Russia would be proven irrelevant, all talk and no action, as important as Bolivia, whose President’s plane can be grounded and searched at will. Unable to defend its allies, unable to stand its ground, Russia would’ve been left with a ‘moral victory’, a euphemism for defeat. Everything Putin has worked for in 13 years at the helm would’ve been lost; Russia would be back to where it was in 1999, when Belgrade was bombed by Clinton.</p>
<p> The acme of this confrontation was reached in the Obama-Putin exchange on exceptionalism. The two men were not buddies to start with. Putin was annoyed by what he perceived as Obama’s insincerity and hypocrisy. A man who climbed from the gutter to the very top, Putin cherishes his ability to talk frankly with people of all walks of life. His frank talk can be shockingly brutal. When he was heckled by a French journalist regarding treatment of Chechen separatists, he replied:</p>
<p> “the Muslim extremists (takfiris) are enemies of Christians, of atheists, and even of Muslims because they believe that traditional Islam is hostile to the goals that they set themselves. And if you want to become an Islamic radical and are ready to be circumcised, I invite you to Moscow. We are a multi-faith country and we have experts who can do it. And I would advise them to carry out that operation in such a way that nothing would grow in that place again”.</p>
<p> Another example of his shockingly candid talk was given at Valdai as he replied to BBC’s Bridget Kendall. She asked: did the threat of US military strikes actually play a rather useful role in Syria’s agreeing to have its weapons placed under control?</p>
<p> Putin replied: Syria got itself chemical weapons as an alternative to Israel’s nuclear arsenal. He called for the disarmament of Israel and invoked the name of Mordecai Vanunu as an example of an Israeli scientist who opposes nuclear weapons. (My interview with Vanunu had been recently published in the largest Russian daily paper, and it gained some notice).</p>
<p> Putin tried to talk frankly to Obama. We know of their exchange from a leaked record of the Putin-Netanyahu confidential conversation. Putin called the American and asked him: what’s your point in Syria? Obama replied: I am worried that Assad’s regime does not observe human rights. Putin almost puked from the sheer hypocrisy of this answer. He understood it as Obama’s refusal to talk with him “on eye level”.</p>
<p> In the aftermath of the Syrian stand-off, Obama appealed to the people of the world in the name of American exceptionalism. The United States’ policy is “what makes America different. It’s what makes us exceptional”, he said. Putin responded: “It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional. We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord’s blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.” This was not only an ideological, but theological contradistinction.</p>
<p> As I expounded at length elsewhere, the US is built on the Judaic theology of exceptionalism, of being Chosen. It is the country of Old Testament. This is the deeper reason for the US and Israel’s special relationship. Europe is going through a stage of apostasy and rejection of Christ, while Russia is deeply Christian. Its churches are full, they bless one other with Christmas and Easter blessings, instead of neutral “seasons”. Russia is a New Testament country. And rejection of exceptionalism, of chosenness is the underlying tenet of Christianity.</p>
<p> For this reason, while organised US Jewry supported the war, condemned Assad and called for US intervention, the Jewish community of Russia, quite numerous, wealthy and influential one, did not support the Syrian rebels but rather stood by Putin’s effort to preserve peace in Syria. Ditto Iran, where the wealthy Jewish community supported the legitimate government in Syria. It appears that countries guided by a strong established church are immune from disruptive influence of lobbies; while countries without such a church ­ the US and/or France ­ give in to such influences and adopt illegal interventionism as a norm.</p>
<p> As US hegemony declines, we look to an uncertain future. The behemoth might of the US military can still wreck havoc; a wounded beast is the most dangerous one. Americans may listen to Senator Ron Paul who called to give up overseas bases and cut military expenditure. Norms of international law and sovereignty of all states should be observed. People of the world will like America again when it will cease snooping and bullying. It isn’t easy, but we’ve already negotiated the Cape and gained Good Hope.</p>

<p>The high priests of academic and “official” history love a good villain for two reasons:  First, because good official villains make the struggles and accomplishments of good official heroes even more awe-inspiring.  And, second, because nothing teaches (or propagandizes) the masses more thoroughly than the social or political lessons inherent in the documented rise and fall of the world&#8217;s most despicable inhabitants.  We get shivers of fear and excitement when we discuss the evils and the follies of ancient monsters like Nero, Attila the Hun, Caligula, etc, or more modern monsters, like Mussolini, Stalin Hitler, Goebbels, Mao, Pol Pot, Idi Amin, and so on.  We take solace in the idea that “we are nothing like them”, and our nation has “moved beyond” such animalistic behavior.</p>
<p>But even more fascinating popcorn-style history is found not in the destruction of tyrants, but the destruction of empires.</p>
<p>When an entire culture steps off the edge of the abyss into the realm of societal psychosis, the world often changes forever and in ways that, at least on the surface, seem to bring humanity a little closer together.  The fall of Rome led to the eventual rise of a dominant Catholic theocracy and the rulership of royal blood lineage that lasted for centuries in Europe.  The flames of World War I and the destabilization of the Kaiser&#8217;s Germany led to the formation of the League Of Nations; a first attempt at a global governing authority designed to “maintain world peace”.  World War II and the fall of the Third Reich resulted in considerable horrors, which the establishment of the United Nations was supposedly meant to prevent from ever occurring again.  The decline of the British Empire saw the implosion of cultural colonialism, and the rise of corporate colonialism, which centralized immense power into the hands of the banking class as the new official oligarchs of our modern era.  The collapse of the Berlin Wall and the abandonment of the Soviet Union was lauded by then U.S. President George Bush as the beginnings of a “New World Order” &#8211; an ideological concept which heralds the final deterioration of the idea of economic and political sovereignty as a mainstay of human civilization.</p>
<p>When examining the approved version of historical conflict, one gets the overwhelming impression that the villains of our past, through their hubris, their greed, and their insanity, seem to inspire a sudden surge of unification as their ashes are cleared from the air.  One might even come to believe that the “natural progression” of conflict is leading us towards a future in which the only solution is the dissolution of all boundaries and the adoption of a one world narrative.  Wouldn&#8217;t it be glorious if the deaths of these malevolent tyrants and societies finally inspired the birth of a single human system in which no conflict is possible because we are all on the same side?</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be glorious, if you have adopted the childish notions of history common to the mainstream.  For those who have not, the story, and the ultimate solutions to the ills of mankind, become a little more complicated&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>America&#8217;s Villainous Mustache </strong></p>
<p>Mainstream history tends to follow the motions of a play or film, in that archetypes and symbolic figures are consistently created in order to satisfy the natural flow of a particular fiction.  The bad guy wears a mustache (not always, but it is strange and disturbing to see how often this archetype materializes in the mainstream world view.  Just look at Hitler, Stalin, Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, Muammar Gaddafi, Bashar al-Assad, etc.  We love mustached villains).  His criminal successes make him imposing and frightening.  He acts without conscience, or, he wrongly believes his terrible actions are justified in the name of the “greater good”.  His inevitable mistakes make his final failure ironic and satisfying in the face of the iconic hero, who defeats the enemy while the citizenry stands back and watches in awe and wonder as helpless spectators.</p>
<p>The villain is indeed evil, and deserves to be dethroned, but the assumption many people make is that the other side is diametrically good.  This is not always the case&#8230;</p>
<p>America is used to playing the role of the hero in the epic tale of modern Earth.  Our nation began with an act of defiance and victory so unexpected and so poetic, it cemented our cultural identity as freedom fighters for centuries to come.  Over time, our government, turning progressively corrupt, has exploited this cultural identity in order to lure Americans into committing atrocities in the name of our traditional sense of “heroism”.  We have, in fact, become the very antagonists we thought we were fighting against (there&#8217;s the delicious irony needed to round out our fairytale).</p>
<p>Our government&#8217;s actions surrounding Syria, for instance, have made America appear not just bloodthirsty, but also ridiculous.  The Obama Administration has taken us to the brink of World War III and left us there to stare out over the chasm.  The slightest breeze could send us plummeting.  All to generate military support for Al-Qaeda, the same organization designated by the establishment as our mortal enemy.</p>
<p>In the meantime, our economic system now survives solely on the whims of the Federal Reserve, a private central bank that answers to NO ONE, and writes fiscal policy without oversight.  The government is not only seeking to trigger world war, it also wants to pay for that war with money we do not have, riding debts we cannot pay, to foreign creditors we will piss off in the process of unleashing our unfunded laser guided hell.</p>
<p>Never has the U.S. been slathered in so much absurdity all at once.  Now, we wear the mustache&#8230;</p>
<p>Most of us in the Liberty Movement would agree that our country is being poisoned from within, and that our government for many decades has become an enemy of all free peoples.  But there is a very important question that we seem to have overlooked:</p>
<p>If America has been written as the villain, then who is meant to be the hero?</p>
<p><strong>Putin Is Not Your Buddy</strong></p>
<p>Lets step back from the global stage for a moment and examine the situation from a different perspective.  What if the U.S. is not just a product of corruption for corruption&#8217;s sake?  What if our new identity as the next historical evil-doer is part of a greater script, and America&#8217;s fall from grace is meant to be used to foment the success of fantastic (but fake) protagonists in an engineered fight for a “better and more centralized world”?</p>
<p>How many of us in the Liberty Movement cheered the diplomatic and strategic prowess of Vladimir Putin, for example, in the days leading to Obama&#8217;s “red line” attack on Syria?  We cheered because his position was correct, and his demeanor made our government look homicidal by comparison.  We cheered his letter to TIME Magazine because we are tired of being the only people pointing out the vicious parasite our political body has become, and it was exciting to be vindicated by an outside source.  We cheered his protection of Edward Snowden, a truly courageous whistle blower that exposed the terrifying Orwellian nature of the NSA.  We watch video reports from Russia Today (RT) because they give a far more accurate accounting of the facts in the U.S. than all American media entities combined.  It is easy for us to get caught up in the idea that since the West has become the bad guy, the East must now be the good guy.</p>
<p>The problem is, we are being played yet again.</p>
<p>Putin has long called for the end of the dollar&#8217;s world reserve status and the creation of a new “global structure” and a “global currency” revolving around the IMF&#8217;s Special Drawing Rights:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/at-g20-kremlin-to-pitch-new-currency/375364.html">http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/at-g20-kremlin-to-pitch-new-currency/375364.html</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/davos/4376315/Russian-prime-minister-Vladimir-Putin-calls-for-end-of-dollar-stranglehold.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/davos/4376315/Russian-prime-minister-Vladimir-Putin-calls-for-end-of-dollar-stranglehold.html</a></p>
<p>Is it just coincidence that Putin wants the same centralized global economy and global governance that the IMF and multiple banking elites have been calling for for years?  The same elites who created the debt crisis and currency crisis we now face in America?  Is it just coincidence that Eastern economic and political dominance over issues like Syria perfectly benefits the IMF plan for an financial shift to the BRICS nations and away from the U.S. greenback?  The same plan promoted by many American financial moguls?</p>
<p>Russia is a model for despotic socialized society posing as “civilized society”, and yet, our government has made America so ugly that Russia looks noble by comparison.  Putin is placed on the cover of TIME magazine everywhere in the world except the U.S., and the Washington Times responds by stating that such behavior is a sign of “America&#8217;s downward spiral in the global community”, as if we are about to be shunned from the world at large:</p>
<p><a href="http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/conscience-realist/2013/sep/18/time-puts-vladimir-putin-its-front-cover-everywher/">http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/conscience-realist/2013/sep/18/time-puts-vladimir-putin-its-front-cover-everywher/</a></p>
<p>While RT produces fantastic journalistic pieces that are critical of American government, rarely if ever do they turn a discerning eye to Russia, and this is not just oversight.</p>
<p>Look carefully at the narrative that is being constructed here.  Putin is NOT our buddy.  He represents exactly what our own government now represents; globalism and naked centralized government aggression against the individual.  However, as mainstream history is being written, the story will be told that it was nations like Russia and China, and organizations like the IMF, that tried to hold back the tide of catastrophe while America, the last empire, steamrolled into thick-skulled oblivion surfing on a shockwave of fiat money and brute military vanity.<br />
<strong><br />
The Washington Aristocracy Is Scum, But Don&#8217;t Let That Fool You&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Most people with an extensive Liberty Movement education are well aware that false paradigms are used in politics by establishment elites in order to control social discussion and to divide the population against each other.  The Left/Right debate has been and always will be a farce, being that the leadership on both sides of the aisle have identical goals when it comes to the most important aspects of the American structure.  The elites of the Democratic and Republican parties, regardless of rhetoric, will BOTH strive for greater government power, less individual liberty, the erasure of economic sovereignty and free markets, and a dependent and enslaved public.  On these pursuits, they completely agree.</p>
<p>In one week, our faux leadership is to decide once AGAIN on the possibility of a debt ceiling increase that will bring us ever closer to a debt and currency avalanche event.  During past debates, much fanfare is given to the supposed conflict between the interests of the Democrats and the GOP, up until the last moment when the GOP caves in completely and allows the debt ceiling to be vaulted.  Will the same happen again in this case?  It depends on how quickly the establishment wants to bring entire roof down on our heads.</p>
<p>A freeze of the debt ceiling would eventually mean default on our Treasury Bonds, since our government must take on exponential debt in order to receive the benefits of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s printing press, as well as pay off our foreign creditors.</p>
<p>A government shutdown could slow the growth of some liabilities, but it does not account for the liabilities already in circulation, thus, we can still default.  Not to mention, our debt and currency standing could easily come into question, resulting in a bond dump or loss of reserve status.</p>
<p>The only option that does not result in a fast moving firestorm through our financial system is a debt ceiling increase, and how much longer can we get away with kicking the can down the road?  In any case, America is about to change for the worse, and the decision on when this is to happen was made a long time ago.  The Washington aristocracy is blatantly guilty in the instigation of our current dilemma, and my theory is, they want you to know they are the culprit, as long as you continue believing they are the ONLY culprit.  They want you to forget all about the IMF, the corporate elites, and Vladimir Putin&#8217;s involvement in the larger plan.  They want you to cheer when international banks and what&#8217;s left of the G20 rescue us after years of fiscal disaster and institute centralized global economic governance.  They want to be the only authors of this story, and what author doesn&#8217;t want to see himself placed in the role of the champion?</p>
<p>Just as there are false political paradigms, there are also false international paradigms.  The Liberty Movement is the wild card; an unknown quantity.  We aren&#8217;t fighting for one side or the other – we are fighting for particular principles and beliefs.  The establishment&#8217;s best strategy is to co-opt our momentum by convincing us to focus on alternative opposition, or place our trust in fabricated advocates.  No matter how epically monstrous our government becomes, and no matter how satisfying their ultimate demise will be, our battle does not end with them.  It only begins with them.</p>

			<p><img src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/09/nation-of-sheep-ruled-wolves.jpg" alt="" />Goldman Sachs is the epitome of the word “evil.” If one wants to know what the evil central bankers are up to, one only needs to pay attention to the actions of Goldman Sachs. The power elite residing inside of this country does not begin and end with the Federal Reserve, that privilege is reserved for the interrelationship between Goldman Sachs, the Federal Reserve, the corrupt World Bank and the IMF. And now, Goldman Sachs is running the European financial system into the ground as another Goldman Sachs boy, “Super” Mario Monti, has taken over Italy to finish off what is left of the Italian financial system. Monti is also the head of the European Trilateral Commission as well as a Bilderberg member. And yet another Goldman Sachs boy is finishing off the job in Greece. It is the mission of Goldman Sachs to implode the global economy with massive debt arising from the failed derivatives market, in which the debt totals 16 times the total GDP of the planet and that debt has been passed on to the governments of the world. There is no way that any country will ever pay off this debt. The world’s financial system will be collapsed and then reorganized under the Bank of International Settlement. Goldman Sachs is merely the grim reaper in this unholy process.</p>
<h2>The Goals of Goldman Sachs</h2>
<p>The purpose of this article is to expose the three pronged attack, directed at the American people, by Goldman Sachs, and its partners at the Federal Reserve, the US Treasury Department, the IMF and the World Bank. These central banker controlled institutions are engaged in a plot which is designed to accomplish the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The destruction of America’s domestic economy through the introduction of derivative debt which is 16 times greater than the world’s GDP. This goal has been accomplished as evidenced by the fact that America now has more workers on welfare (101 million) as opposed to actual full time workers (97 million).</li>
<li>Setting the chessboard in such a way that WWIII is a foregone conclusion. This is near completion as the US and Israel are poised to go to war with China and Russia, over Syria and Iran, in order to preserve the Petrodollar.</li>
<li>Initiating a false flag event which will culminate in martial law and the elimination to all opposition to both the coming WWIII and the imposition of a tyrannical world government as well as a one world economic system.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is no secret that Goldman Sachs runs Wall Street. After the first bail out, Goldman Sachs cut the head off of Shearson Lehman and several other Wall Street competitors when they used their undue influence to determine winners and losers after the first round of TARP. Even Ray Charles could see that Goldman Sachs is in near complete control of our government as evidenced by the former Goldman Sachs gangsters who have run our economy into the ground (e.g., Clinton’s Secretary of Treasury Goldman Sachs’ Rubin, Bush’s Secretary of Treasury Goldman Sachs’ “too big to fail” Hank Paulson, etc.). Make no mistake about it, the introduction of the massive derivatives debt was a power consolidation move designed to collapse the economy and hand over essential control to Goldman Sachs and its partners.</p>
<h2>History Repeats Itself</h2>
<p>Today’s events parallel the imperialists of the early 2oth Century which resulted in World War I. The Wall Street led depression of the 1930’s led to the rise of political extremism and ultimately to World War II. Today, Goldman Sachs and their fellow Wall Street cronies are currently running, or dare I say ruining the global economy and the consequences are going to result in the culmination of World War III from which these same gangster bankster’s will profit from the buildup, the death and destruction of billions of innocent people as well as profiting from the lucrative clean up which follows every war.</p>
<p>The ultimate prize for the coming war will be the ruination of the planet in order that the power structure of the earth can be reinvented in a manner that not even George Orwell could imagine. Remember, as the globalists like to say in reference to their favorite Hegelian Dialectic quote, “Out of chaos comes order.” Of course, it won’t be Goldman Sachs’ money that pays for the destruction of humanity in the coming world war. This coming war and its subsequent blood money will be your money and my money. It goes without saying that it won’t be the executives of Goldman Sachs children who are pressed into military service and will be eventually sacrificed on the battlefields of WWIII. It will be your children and my children who will be sacrificed in the name of furthering the bottom line of the Goldman Sachs Mafia and their masters at the Bank of International Settlement. Meanwhile, the Goldman Sachs children who will be safely tucked away as the world’s final chapter plays out as we know it.</p>
<h2> Goldman Sachs Destroying the American Middle Class</h2>
<p>This swath of international destruction being promulgated by Goldman Sachs is also being visited upon the daily lives of the American public here at home. Courtesy of the Goldman Sachs gangsters, there are no more safe financial havens for American citizens. Your bank account, your pension fund, your investment accounts and your home mortgages are no longer safe. These collective funds are not in jeopardy because of the risk of falling victim to the failing economy as much as these funds are subject to confiscation by Goldman Sachs and its shell corporations along with the complicit support of the federal government. Most of these public officials are former Goldman Sachs employees. A clear case in point lies in what happened with MF Global.</p>
<p>MF Global, a shell corporation beholding to Goldman Sachs, was led to the slaughter by the former Goldman Sachs executive and former New Jersey Governor and senator, John Corzine. Corzine’s criminal actions directly victimized 150,000 Americans by stealing an estimated $900 million dollars of his clients’ money from their supposedly secure private accounts. There is also another $600 million missing dollars from MF Global which is still unaccounted for today.  Meanwhile, Corzine avoids sharing a prison cell with Bernie Madoff by purchasing a “get-out-of-jail card” through the sponsorship of a $35,000 per plate fundraiser for that great Wall Street puppet, Barack Hussein Obama. And what are the government watch dogs doing to protect our money from this new generation of robber barons? The short answer is that key federal officials are actually partners with Goldman Sachs in this monumental violation of the public trust. Take Gary Gensler, a former Goldman Sachs executive partner, who like so many other Goldman Sachs gangsters, have been placed into key governmental oversight positions in order to protect the Goldman Sachs co-conspirators from prosecution as they continue their reign of terror upon the global economy.</p>
<p><a href="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/2013/09/19/who-is-the-most-evil-corporation-on-tehe-earth/gensler/" rel="attachment wp-att-5083"><img alt="...but a Goldman Sachs cop on the take. " src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/09/gensler.jpg" width="263" height="192" /></a></p>
<p>…but a Goldman Sachs cop on the take.</p>
<p>Gary “the gangster” Gensler is the former <a title="Undersecretary of the Treasury" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undersecretary_of_the_Treasury">Undersecretary of the Treasury</a>(1999-2001) and <a title="Assistant Secretary of the Treasury" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_Secretary_of_the_Treasury">Assistant Secretary of the Treasury</a> (1997-1999) and the current director of the <a title="Commodity Futures Trading Commission" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</a>. In his position at the time of the MF Global debacle, Gensler had the authority to go after Corzine for his role in the MF Global theft of customer funds and order restitution. However, Gensler has decided to protect a fellow member of the Goldman Sachs Mafia by not looking into the massive fraud and theft by Corzine and his cronies. Your tax dollars, paying the salary of federal officials, are overseeing the most massive illegal private transfer of wealth in the history of the planet. And this debt is payable to Goldman Sachs and their criminal enterprise partners.</p>
<p>You may not be one of the current 150,000 Goldman Sachs/MF Global victims. However, this Robin Hood-in-reverse-scenario, in which the rich are plundering what’s left of the middle class, will soon be visited upon your bank account, your home mortgages and your pensions. Whether it is the MERS mortgage fraud or the theft being perpetrated upon Federal employee retirement accounts, these criminal banksters are in the process of stealing it all and what are you going to do about it? Our nation of entrenched sheep will do nothing. The American citizens are going to lie down and take their beating in the face of the largest unfolding criminal syndicate in human history.</p>
<p>While you and the rest of America are trying to collectively remove your “deer in the headlight” glaze, you, as an American, have far more serious issues to concern yourself with and you are not going to have to wait long to have your worst fears to be born out.</p>
<h2> Something Wicked This Way Comes</h2>
<p>Some, who have heard my expressed sense of outrage, have asked me if I favor a violent overthrow the United States Government. To that question, I answer in the negative. However, show me a way to be involved in the overthrow of the gangsters who have hijacked my country’s government, and I will be the first in line. However, before that day arrives, we have some very formidable obstacles to face with regard to what is looming just around the corner.</p>
<h2>Goldman Sachs Is the Financial Kingpin of False Flag Attacks</h2>
<p>If one wants to predict the next false flag attack, one merely has to watch the actions and the money movements of Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to the attacks on 9/11, Goldman Sachs “shorted” the sale of airline stocks which plummeted in the aftermath of the attacks. Just a coincidence you say?</p>
<p>In the days leading up to the housing bubble, Goldman Sachs shorted housing stocks which ignited the bubble. The Federal government fined Goldman Sachs, but in typical fashion, nobody went to jail. Just another coincidence you say?</p>
<p>As I documented in my seven part series, <em>The Great Gulf Coast Holocaust</em>, Goldman Sachs executed a “put option” for preferred insiders invested in Transocean stock, thus protecting the profits of these preferred insiders on the morning of the explosion. Transocean was the owner of the ill-fated oil rig. Goldman Sachs also sold the lion’s share of its stock less than two weeks before that fateful day on April 20, 2010. Nalco was the subsidiary of Goldman Sachs and BP at the time of the explosion. Who is Nalco? Nalco was the exclusive manufacturer of the deadly oil dispersant, Corexit. Corexit has done more to wreck the ecology of the Gulf as well as the health of the Gulf Coast residents than the oil spill itself. Again, this is all documented in my seven part series. By the way, I count another three coincidences in this paragraph alone and if you are keeping score, we are looking at a total of five amazing coincidences. But wait, there is more!</p>
<p>The moral of this story is clear, if there is to be a significant false flag event, the financial actions of Goldman Sachs will prove to be the key. And Goldman Sachs’ actions have signaled yet another oncoming false flag. As I reported on in April, Goldman Sachs instructed its brokers to sell short on gold stocks. And then after the bulk of the gold market panicked and the price of gold plummeted in a massive sell off, the Goldman Sachs boys did it again. The Goldman Sachs brokers began to purchase gold in massive amounts, for its elite clients, at a greatly depressed price. By the way, Goldman Sachs employed the EXACT same strategy with regard to the Gulf Oil tragedy. When Goldman Sachs sold off BP stock in the days before the explosion, they purchased massive amounts of BP stock at a greatly reduced price in June of 2010. The coincidence meter is now up to seven.</p>
<h2>Why Goldman Sachs Cornered the Gold Market</h2>
<p>The global elite would only want massive amounts of gold because something bad is about to happen to the dollar. When the dollar collapses, the elite, courtesy of the Goldman Sachs brokers will be sitting in a great position in which they hold the only sustainable medium of exchange following the collapse. But when will the collapse come? What form will it take?</p>
<p>As I reported, less than two weeks ago, the Bank of International Settlement ordered the central banks, including the Federal Reserve, to greatly decrease loans as a protection to the coming bad financial times. So, now we are getting warned and the narrowing down of where this is leading, is getting easier to predict.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that Goldman Sachs and the rest of the international banking community desperately want to wage war in Syria and eventually Iran over the demise of the Petrodollar caused by Iran in which they are selling oil for gold to India, China and Russia. There is also big money to be made by the banks in an upcoming global conflict. More importantly, and just as the world witnessed in the aftermath of WWII, consolidation of power can be achieved following a major war. Additionally, Goldman Sachs and the rest of the international bankers are not about to let China and Russia thumb their noses at the prevailing economic system. Gold will not be allowed to be used as a medium of exchange for nation states, because a nation on the gold standard, is a nation that controls its debt levels and financial security. This is unacceptable to the central bankers who kill national leaders, such as Gadaffi and Sadam Hussein, for daring to break from the plan and achieve financial independence. What the globalists also need is a game changing event which will destroy all opposition to the coming war. And the financial intentions of Goldman Sachs clearly speaks to the fact that a false flag attack is imminent which will implicate Syria and Iran and provide the pretext for the US and Israel to attack.</p>
<h2>The Nature of the Coming False Flag Attack</h2>
<p>The coming false flag attack which will plunge America into martial law, for our own protection of course, will result in WWIII. The false flag event could take two forms. It was reported two weeks ago, that the US was missing a nuclear weapon from a military base in Texas. This prompted Senator Lindsay Graham to state that the harbor in Charleston, SC. would be nuked if the US did not attack Syria. This is the first scenario.</p>
<p>The other scenario, and the far more likely one, has the power grid going down on November 13th. The Grid Ex II drill being conducted by DHS, FEMA, 150 corporations and the 50 governors, will simulate a power grid take down by terrorists on that same date. How many times have we witnessed a drill which turns into a false flag attack? This happened with 9/11, the 7/7 bombings and the Boston Marathon. There is a good chance it is going to happen here</p>
<p>In this scenario, once the grid is taken down, a banking collapse can be instituted and most will not notice because by the third day of a blackout, total chaos will ensue and nobody will be paying attention to the banks. Martial law will be imposed and Syria and Iran will be blamed.</p>
<p>The CEO of Goldman Sachs, <a href="http://www.deepcaster.com/SubscribersOnly/ArchiveView.cfm?pfvID=1724">Llloyd Blankfein</a>, is on the record stating that an economic collapse is imminent. Need I say more?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2012/10/27/the-relentless-evil-of-goldman-sachs/goldman-sachs-flag-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-540"><img title="goldman sachs flag" alt="" src="http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2012/10/goldman-sachs-flag1.jpg" width="284" height="178" /></a></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Regardless of the form that an upcoming false flag event will follow, Goldman Sachs has tipped their false flag hand. A false flag event is coming and it is a safe bet that it will culminate in martial law. This would certainly explain DHS’ collecting of 2.6 billion rounds of ammunition and 2700 armored personnel carriers. There is also going to be a resulting third world war. The globalists know humanity is waking up. They are running out time and they are desperate. This could all be over in a few months. Do you not feel the collective sense of dreaded anticipation that has overtaken the country? At the unconscious level, we all know what is coming.</p>
<p>The November power grid drill is worth watching and I predict in the upcoming weeks, there will be many articles written about how to survive the coming events. I would advise all to pay attention, but most of all, I would advise people to get their spiritual affairs in order. We come into the world with nothing and all we leave with is the sum total of our spiritual experiences. It is time to attend to that detail in the present time frame.</p>

			<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/reichstag.jpg" height="120" />All historians are familiar with how Hitler was able to seize and consolidate power within the German Reichstag. He simply had his henchmen burn the German legislative building to the ground and then blame the Communists, one of the Nazi’s chief rivals. Subsequently, Hitler assumed total dictatorial power, as a pretense to protect the German people, and he was able to eliminate the Communists and the rest, as they say, was history.</p>
<h4>Obama Is Under Immense Pressure</h4>
<p>Obama is under enormous pressure, from the Banksters to take out the Iranian regime. The need to take down Iran is necessitated because the <a href="http://http//thecommonsenseshow.com/2013/01/13/petrodollar-scam/">Petrodollar</a> is in real trouble because of Iran’s insistence on selling oil to India, China and Russia in exchange for gold.</p>
<p>Gold is a four letter word to the Banksters. The Banksters must maintain their fiat currency schemes. Subsequently, the Banksters must dominate the purchase of oil and the distribution of gold for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Banksters thrive on fiat currency which is backed by virtually nothing and this is coupled with fractional reserve practices in order to acquire real material wealth based on their creation of worthless paper and the introduction of gold threatens this Ponzi scheme;</li>
<li>Since <a href="http://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/BrettonWoods">Breton Woods</a>, the world has been forced by the Banksters to play in their Ponzi scheme game by first purchasing Federal Reserve dollars which is in turn used to purchase oil. Saddam Hussein failed to play by the Petrodollar rules by selling oil for Euros and paid for his disobedience with his life; and,</li>
<li>Once the Banksters collapse the currencies of the world, they want to be the ones controlling gold, the only remaining currency, in a post economic Armageddon.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Obama Is In Deep Trouble</h4>
<div><img alt="This is what happens to those who say no the central banking cartel." src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hussein-hanging.jpg" width="250" height="188" /><br />
<em>This is what happens to those who say no the central banking cartel.</em></p>
</div>
<p>If Obama wants to complete his second term, he must get help from the globalists in managing the enormous Watergate type of scenarios which surfaced in May of 2013 that included (1) The Ed Snowden NSA spy revelations; (2) The IRS harassing the Tea Party members at the behest of Obama; (3) The administration’s spying on AP reporters; (4) the Michael Hastings murder (June 2013); and, (5) The Benghazi Affair which refuses to go away. Any of these five events provides sufficient cause for Obama’s removal from office as they dwarf Nixon’s misdeeds in the Watergate Scandal.</p>
<p>The country is three months removed from the near simultaneous revelations, the likes, never seen in this quantity and severity in American history. I stopped believing in coincidences a long time ago. The release of the scandalous information related to these events is being orchestrated and controlled by the overlords and their media minions. Why?</p>
<p>Obama is dragging his feet on Middle East intervention and the globalists are attempting to move him off of the mark with some friendly blackmail.</p>
<p>As previously stated, Iran is undermining the Petrodollar. Iran must be taken down. Sadly America, if the Banksters do not get their way and conduct a regime change in Iran, the dollar will collapse and America will witness its darkest days ever. Conversely, China and Russia have threatened to “nuke” the United States if they invade Syria and Iran over the issue of gold for oil. Make no mistake about it. Iran is the chief prize. Egypt is a tragic, but useful distraction because of the loss of life. The events in Syria are merely a means to an end and only serves as the preliminary event in preparation for the main event, the destruction of Iran. Syria must be taken down first, then Iran will surely follow. Mark my words, Assad will be hanging from a noose, Saddam style, in a few short months.</p>
<h4>Why Attack Syria Before Iran?</h4>
<p>If Iran is the prize, then why is the United States on the precipice of attacking Syria? Simple, all roads to Teheran run through Damsacus. Syria is one of Iran’s few remaining allies and controlling Syria is the key to a successful invasion of Iran. Most importantly, capturing Syria largely blocks a Russian land force military incursion into Syria so long as the U.S. is successful in quickly setting up its short and medium range missile batteries inside of Syria. These batteries are a crucial element in blocking Russian military troop movements into Syria.</p>
<div><img alt="Another victim of the central banksters." src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/gaddafi.jpg" width="250" /><br />
<em>Another victim of the central banksters.</em></p>
</div>
<p>For Obama to take out Syria, he has to neutralize their command and control structure. This means taking out their aerial surveillance capabilities, its Air Force, controlling the movement of their tanks and other heavy military equipment as well as isolating Syrian military units from the air and preventing them from reinforcing Damascus. This leaves Assad vulnerable.</p>
<p>Once the Syrian military is isolated and divided, the CIA backed al-Qaeda forces will turn the tide of the CIA backed Syrian civil war and this will effectively take care of Assad in the same manner that they took care of Gaddafi in Libya.</p>
<p>In order to launch a successful air campaign, the U.S. needs a pretext so horrific, so terrible that global opinion will demand a military incursion to “save the innocent Syrian people.” To accomplish this goal, Obama has already done what he does best, create a Reichstag moment (i.e. false flag).</p>
<h4>The CIA Backed al-Qaeda Lights the Fuse</h4>
<p>Syria has just experienced its Reichstag moment. Three Damascus hospitals supported by<a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=7029#sthash.IGLS1MFL.dpuf">Doctors Without Borders</a> state that they are treating 3,600 patients who are exhibiting neurotoxic symptoms, which occurred in one brief, three hour period on August 21, 2013. Of the 3,600 patients, 355 have died. This is Syria’s Reichstag moment as Assad is being framed for this chemical weapons attack.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The Assad forces have been widely accused for perpetrating this crime against humanity through the purposeful release of neurotoxic agents. However, only a fool with no common sense would believe that Assad is behind the chemical weapons attacks. Assad would avoid at all costs doing that one thing that could invite U.S. or NATO intervention into Syria. The use of chemical weapons by Assad would provide NATO with the pretext to launch airstrikes which would tip the balance of power in Syria in the same manner as it did in Libya.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>As I write these words, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is moving American attack forces into range of Syria and these forces are awaiting a “presidential decision.” Russia is showing signs of backing down as they have encouraged Assad to allow UN inspectors into Syria. My assessment is that Russia and China will stand down with regard to American airstrikes into Syria because they know that this chemical weapons false flag attack, perpetrated by the CIA backed al-Qaeda forces, has proven successful and these two nations cannot be seen as supporting such a criminal regime.</p>
<p>China and Russia have one main objective, save Iran and they can still stand down in Syria and be able to discourage an American led invasion of Iran. The Chinese and Russians will also still possess the nuclear option at their disposal in protecting their “gold for oil” investment in Iran. Subsequently, the U.S. will continue to support al-Qaeda backed Syrian rebels as they overthrow Assad and consolidate their gains over the next few weeks. As in Iraq, look for BP and EXXON to control Syrian oil and prevent any further undermining of the Petrodollar in Syria as in Iran.</p>
<h4>Think Like a Genocidal Maniac</h4>
<p>Once one covers the establishment’s game plan related to a multitude of issues, their next moves become relatively simple to predict because the Banksters predictably use the same playbook time after time. In order to predict their next moves, we have to, God forbid, think like the genocidal maniac banksters.</p>
<p>As the United States consolidates its holdings in Syria, negates Russian land force incursions and begins to bring money into the Federal Reserve and the Bank of International Settlement through their soon-to-be Syrian holdings, plans will be implemented to manipulate an excuse for an invasion of Iran.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, what could be the one thing that Iran could be accused of doing that would gather the support of the world for invading Iran and force the Chinese and the Russians to stand down? The answer is undoubtedly a false flag operation, the likes that the world has never seen. What could be so horrific, so terrible that Iran could be framed as the perpetrator? The globalists have already set the stage for the next false flag event. What has Iran been repeatedly accused of? They have been accused of attempting to develop nuclear weapons. The American public has already been conditioned to associate nuclear weapons with Iran, even though many legitimately question this association.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/boston-martial-law-dhs-250x300.jpg" width="250" height="300" />If you are still thinking like a genocidal maniac, there are two variables to consider, a nuclear detonation on American soil and/or a massive and virulent chemical weapons attack launched against America citizens. I believe it is likely that the Boston Marathon bombing was the dress rehearsal for what is coming. As in Boston, we will see quick apprehensions of alleged Iranian terrorists. Summary execution of the so-called perpetrators will follow an imaginary standoff and evidence will be planted so there is no question of Iranian guilt. Look for a group of U.S. veterans to be implicated as well as it will solidify the justification for the imposition of martial law. DHS will then take to the streets in their new 2700 armored vehicles.</p>
<h4>Predicting Dates Is Normally a Fool’s Errand</h4>
<p>Syria will fall in September. A false flag event would likely happen in October and it will be game over in Iran by Thanksgiving. I do not predict dates, ever. However, in this instance, I am going to make an exception.</p>
<p>There are two dates that loom large in our future over the next four months that have the globalists highly concerned. The globalists do not want to raise conscious awareness of the Bankster controlled organized crime syndicate which hijacked our government in 2008.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/jfk.jpg" width="217" height="232" />The first date that the globalists are concerned about is the lead up to November 22nd. This is the 50th anniversary of the JFK assassination. The forces behind the JFK assassination were big oil, the military industrial complex and radical fringe elements of the military and Secret Service. The plot was organized by the CIA and facilitated by the Operation Mongoose forces of the CIA and the Mafia backed forces seeking to overthrow Castro. A whole new generation, who has never looked at the JFK assassination, will be awakened to the undue influence of some of the aforementioned forces who still yield in their perverse influence over America in 2013.</p>
<p>The second date that must be very troubling to the globalists is the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Federal Reserve. Talk shows and websites will be abuzz with revelations about these criminal bankers and the fact that the dollar is actually worth about 3 cents. People who have never heard of fractional reserve currency and a fiat currency will hear about it from November 22-December 23. The Banskters do not want to contend with an increasingly awake America. This would make the subjugation of this country much more difficult.</p>
<p>These are the reasons that the globalists are expediting their timetable for subjugation of this country. This is why Obama’s hand is being forced by holding five Watergate type scandals over his head at the same time. Following the coming false flag attacks, the country will be in lockdown and against these tyrants will be increasingly difficult and November 23rd and December 23rd will be dates that will come and pass without much fanfare.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>These events are only possible if we have a psychopathic, genocidal set of maniacs calling the shots. The more awake among us know are fully aware that this is the case.</p>
<p>America presently has some very disturbing variables which have been simultaneously put into play. World War III is a definite possibility. False flag attacks on American soil is a likely event over the next 60 days. These are times of unparalleled danger in America.</p>

</div>
<p>With the constant drumbeat that Armageddon is imminent, it is easy to dismiss the geopolitical threats that pose a <a href="http://batr.org/realpolitik.html">realpolitik</a> danger. The prospects that definite weapons of mass destruction will engulf the planet in a nuclear winter are upon us once again. After the collapse of the Soviet evil empire, the Reagan &#8211; Gorbachev détente provided the world with one of its last hopes for restoring rational international relations. Regretfully, the last superpower used the defeat of the Marxist model of tyranny to impose their Pax American version of a global New World Order. The military machine of NATO, furnished with DARPA technology, would implement the NeoCon policy based upon the interest of the true masters behind the <em>kosher</em> approved empire. Justin Raimondo poses the question: <a href="http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2013/06/02/are-we-on-the-brink-of-world-war-iii/">Are We On the Brink of World War III?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The end of the cold war did not lead to a &#8220;unipolar world,&#8221; as Charles Krauthammer and his fellow neocons celebrated it in the early 1990s. Instead of the &#8220;benevolent global hegemony&#8221; envisioned by Bill Kristol and Robert Kagan in their nineties foreign policy manifesto, we are back to the pre-WWI era of old-fashioned inter-imperialist rivalry. Instead of the &#8220;end of history,&#8221; we stand at the beginning of a new era of nationalism, religious fanaticism, and ideologically-driven violence. Combined with the structural incentives for conflict inherent in our system of alliances and the built-in dangers of a policy of &#8220;collective security,&#8221; this is a recipe for another world war.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The compulsion of the Neoconservatives toward belligerent intervention never serves the interests or enhances the security of the American citizenry. So when <a href="http://www.eutimes.net/2011/12/china-joins-russia-orders-military-to-prepare-for-world-war-iii/">China Joins Russia, Orders Military To Prepare For World War III</a>, what is really behind the rhetoric?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hu’s call for war joins Chinese Rear Admiral and prominent military commentator Zhang Zhaozhong who, likewise, <a href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/china-news/chinese-admiral-threatens-world-war-to-protect-iran-154434.html">warned this past week that</a>: &#8220;China will not hesitate to protect Iran even with a Third World War,&#8221; and Russian General Nikolai Makarov who <a href="http://www.zimbabwemetro.com/?p=30650">grimly stated last week</a>: &#8220;I do not rule out local and regional armed conflicts developing into a large-scale war, including using nuclear weapons.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>From the Trenches attempts to answer this question in the article, <a href="http://www.fromthetrenchesworldreport.com/is-china-gearing-up-to-start-world-war-iii/21974">Is China gearing up to start World War III?</a> <em>&#8220;My take on this is that China’s latest foray into international threat-mongering is indicative of two factors: a desire on the part of the Chinese government to be prepared for any eventuality — and that could include war — and a desire to warn the West that they’re willing to be prepared for any eventuality — and that could include war.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>With this backdrop in mind, the buzz from the seminal Paul Craig Roberts essay, <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2013/07/24/the-two-faux-democracies-threaten-life-on-earth-paul-craig-roberts/">The Two Faux Democracies Threaten Life On Earth</a>, lays out the hubris that underpins this updated vision in the MAD doctrine of victory. Deterrence be dammed, mutually assured destruction is pointless, when preempted aggression has the war machine of absolute annihilation under your command. Dr. Roberts concludes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The post World War II wars originate in Washington and Israel. No other country has imperial expansionary ambitions. The Chinese government has not seized Taiwan, which China could do at will. The Russian government has not seized former constituent parts of Russia, such as Georgia, which, provoked by Washington to launch an attack, was instantly overwhelmed by the Russian Army. Putin could have hung Washington’s Georgian puppet and reincorporated Georgia into Russia, where it resided for several centuries and where many believe it belongs.</p>
<p>For the past 68 years, most military aggression can be sourced to the US and Israel. Yet, these two originators of wars pretend to be the victims of aggression. It is Israel that has a nuclear arsenal that is illegal, unacknowledged, and unaccountable. It is Washington that has drafted a war plan based on nuclear first strike. The rest of the world is correct to view these two rogue unaccountable governments as direct threats to life on earth.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The YouTube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWXjo94d4wk">US Now Determined Highest Priority To Nuclear First Strike China</a>, provides details and perspective on a provision in NDAA authorization.</p>
<p>This chilling first strike war plan, disclosed in the frightening report - <a href="http://yalejournal.org/2013/06/12/who-authorized-preparations-for-war-with-china/">Who Authorized Preparations for War with China?</a> – has to send shivers up the spine of any thinking person. &#8220;The United States is preparing for a war with China, a momentous decision that so far has failed to receive a thorough review from elected officials, namely the White House and Congress. This important change in the United States’ posture toward China has largely been driven by the Pentagon.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the author of this paper, Amitai Etzioni, states, &#8220;I am not arguing that the U.S. military is seeking out war or intentionally usurping the role of the highest civilian authorities&#8221;, the intentional preparation for a pre-empt <em>Dr. Strangelove</em> nuke attack is absurd on its face.</p>
<p>However, placing the blame for this switch in strategic targeting that have China in the cross hair alignment has a direct connection to the Zhang Zhaozhong comments in defense of Iran. If you take away anything from this assessment heed the reality of Zionist dominance and foremost influence on American foreign policy that Paul Craig Roberts identifies so clearly.</p>
<p>China does not want an apocalyptic war with the United States. They are content to wage economic and financial warfare. Notwithstanding the trade dependency that the globalist cabal originated by the Nixon-Kissinger tools with the Red Communists, the authoritarian People&#8217;s Republic of China, are winning the financial battle.</p>
<p>Max Hastings in the MailOnline article, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2066380/Will-World-War-III-U-S-China.html">Will World War III be between the U.S. and China?</a>, correctly concludes.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Beyond mere sabre-rattling, China is conducting increasingly sophisticated cyber-warfare penetration of American corporate, military and government computer systems. For now, their purpose seems exploratory rather than destructive.</p>
<p>But the next time China and the United States find themselves in confrontation, a cyber-conflict seems highly likely. The potential impact of such action is devastating, in an era when computers control almost everything.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If the actual existential national security of the United States is at stake from a Chinese military combat threat, one had better remember the faithful wisdom of <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/02/25/gates-never-fight-a-land-war-in-asia/">General Douglas MacArthur</a> &#8220;<em>Never Fight a Land War in Asia</em>&#8220;. Could the lesson of the failed Iraqi and Afghanistan wars finally be sinking in? Surely, the military-industrial-complex ignored the cogent field marshal’s insight in Viet Nam. Heretofore, the foreign affairs and armed forces geniuses preparing their Sino war plans must be looking to their robot drone battalions for their sneak Amerikan &#8220;Pearl Harbor&#8221; mission.</p>
<p>The dirty little secret is out as <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/chuck-hagel-troops-close-breaking-point-94584.html?hp=l11">Chuck Hagel warns: Troops are ‘close to the breaking point’</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our people are strong and resilient after 12 years of war, but they are under stress — and so are the institutions that support them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Strengthening readiness will ultimately demand that we address unsustainable growth in personnel costs, which represent half of the department’s budget and crowds out vital spending on training and modernization,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If trends continue, we could ultimately be left with a much smaller force that is well-compensated but poorly trained and equipped. That would be unacceptable.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Logical, is it not? Just push a few buttons and use those Trident missiles, while you have the advantage. How else can a dying empire survive unless by waging war?</p>
<p>How outrageous and idiotic this government has become for even having a discussion on starting a nuclear war. Before his railroading and incarceration, <a href="http://forum.batr.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=200">Edgar Steele</a> wrote the essay, <a href="http://rense.com/general72/ww3.htm">World War 3</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The world economy is so broken due to plundering by International bankers and other Zionist elite that Depression II is inevitable. Just like WWII and Depression I, WWIII will be the only way to distract people from their impending economic misery, mask the effects of Depression II and get economies going again. Just like WWII and Depression I, international bankers and other Zionist elite will be the real beneficiaries by loaning and selling to all sides and once again scooping up small businesses, farms and residences for one-tenth their value.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Another major war is on the horizon, but whether it will be a global conflagration is yet, proven. Revelations final conflict will come to pass, but the time of its occurrence is not known to man. How ironic and ludicrous those planners are looking to copy a disastrous Yamamoto strategy and have the arrogance to believe that they are omniscient.</p>
<p>A useful analogy compares the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Daleks">Daleks</a>, a fictional extraterrestrial race of mutants from the British TV Doctor Who series, with the satanic globalist death merchants that thrive on human suffering and ruin. This tribe of moneychangers, bent on universal conquest and destruction, has brought down countless societies.</p>
<p>The Chinese capitalists’ <em>nouveau riche</em> never lost their repressive attitude and undemocratic culture towards their ‘coolie class&#8221;. That is a trait, which coincides with their globalist gangster partners. Allowing a Hiroshima radiation of Chinese joint venture assets does not advance the final subjugation of the planet, for the fascist corporatists. Ever since Zionism conquered the United States, this country has been ruled under Talmud precepts that only benefit the NWO master plan.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/V-for-Vendetta-3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/V-for-Vendetta-2.jpg" align="left" /></a>“V For Vendetta,” a film that portrays evil in a futuristic England as a proxy for the evil that exists today in America, ends with the defeat of evil. But this is a movie in which the hero has super powers. If you have not seen this film, you should watch it. It might wake you up and give you courage. The excerpts below show that, at least among some filmmakers, the desire for liberty still exists.</p>
<p>Whether the desire for liberty exists in America remains to be seen. If Americans can overcome their gullibility, their lifelong brainwashing, their propensity to believe every lie that “their” government tells them, and if Americans can escape the Matrix in which they live, they can reestablish the morality, justice, peace, freedom, and liberty that “their” government has taken from them. It is not impossible for Americans to again stand with uplifted heads. They only have to recognize that “their” government is the enemy of truth, justice, human rights and life itself.</p>
<p>Can mere ordinary Americans triumph over the evil that is “their” government without the aid of a superhero? If ideas are strong enough and Americans can comprehend them, good can prevail over the evil that is concentrated in Washington. What stands between the American people and their comprehension of evil is their gullibility.</p>
<p>If good fails in its battle with Washington’s evil, our future is a boot stamping on the human face forever.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKvvOFIHs4k&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKvvOFIHs4k&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gHVGOoE48" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gHVGOoE48</a></p>
<p>If you, an American, living in superpower America lack the courage to stand up to the evil that is “your” government, perhaps the courage of Edward Snowden, Bradley Manning, Julian Assange, and tiny Ecuador will give you heart.</p>
<p>A US senator from New Jersey, Robert Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the Ecuadoran government that he would block the import of vegetables and flowers from Ecuador if Ecuador gives asylum to Edward Snowden. The cost to Ecuador would be one billion dollars in lost revenues.</p>
<p>Menendez’s statement–”Our government will not reward countries for bad behavior”–is ironic. It equates bad behavior with protecting a truth-teller and good behavior with betraying a truth-teller. Menendez’s statement is also a lie. The US government <em>only</em> rewards bad behavior. The US government consistently rewards those who conspire against the elected governments of their own countries, setting them up as dictators when Washington overthrows the elected governments.</p>
<p>Menendez’s threat did not work, but the senator did succeed in delivering yet another humiliating blow to Washington’s prestige. The Ecuadoran President, Rafael Correa, beat Menendez to the punch and cancelled the trade pact with the US on the grounds that the pact was a threat to the sovereignty of Ecuador and to moral principles and was being used by Washington to blackmail Ecuador. “Ecuador doesn’t accept pressure or threats from anyone,” added Communications Secretary Fernando Alvarado who then offered Washington foreign aid to provide human rights training to combat torture, illegal executions and attacks on peoples’ privacy.</p>
<p>Washington, exposed with its hand in the cookie jar devouring the privacy of the entire world and prevented by its hubris from acknowledging its illegal behavior and apologizing, has so mishandled the Snowden affair that Washington has done far more damage to itself than occurred from Snowden’s revelations. Washington has proven conclusively that it has no respect for anyone’s human rights, that it has no respect for any country’s sovereignty, that it has no respect for any moral principles, especially those it most often mouths, and that it relies on coercion and violence alone. The rest of the world now knows who its enemy is.</p>
<p>Washington’s presstitutes, by helping Washington demonize Snowden, Glenn Greenwald, Manning, Assange, and Ecuador, have demonstrated to the world that the US media is devoid of integrity and that nothing it reports can be believed. The US print and TV media and NPR comprise a ministry of propaganda for Washington’s immoral agendas.</p>
<p>On June 24, the Stasi State’s favorite whore, the Washington Post, denounced three times democratically-elected Rafael Correa as “the autocratic leader of tiny, impoverished Ecuador,” without realizing that the editorial not only demonstrated the Washington Post’s lack of any ethics whatsoever but also showed the entire world that if “tiny, impoverished Ecuador” can stand up to Washington’s threats, so can the rest of the world.</p>
<p>President Correa replied that the Washington Post “managed to focus attention on Snowden and on the ‘wicked’ countries that support him, making us forget the terrible things against the US people and the whole world that he denounced.” Correa added that Washington’s “world order isn’t only unjust, it’s immoral.”</p>
<p>The reason Washington hates Correa has nothing to do with Snowden. That Ecuador is considering asylum for Snowden is just an excuse. Correa is hated, because in the second year of his first term he repudiated the $3 billion dollar foreign debt that corrupt and despotic prior regimes had been paid to contract with international finance. Correa’s default threat forced the international financial gangsters to write down the debt by 60 percent.</p>
<p>Washington also hates Correa because he has been successful in reducing the high rates of poverty in Ecuador, thus building public support that makes if difficult for Washington to overthrow him from within.</p>
<p>Yet another reason Washington hates Correa is because he took steps against the multinational oil companies’ exploitation of Ecuador’s oil resources and limited the amount of offshore deposits in the country’s banks in order to block Washington’s ability to destabilize Ecuador’s financial system.</p>
<p>Washington also hates Correa for refusing to renew Washington’s lease of the air base in Manta.</p>
<p>Essentially, Correa has fought to take control of Ecuador’s government, media and national resources out of Washington’s hands and the hands of the small rich elite allied with Washington. It is a David vs. Goliath story.</p>
<p>In other words, Correa, like Venezuela’s Chevez, is the rare foreign leader who represents the interests of his own country instead of Washington’s interest.</p>
<p>Washington uses the various corrupt NGOs and the puppet government in Colombia as weapons against Correa and the Ecuadoran government. Many believe that it is only a matter of time before Washington succeeds in assassinating Correa.</p>
<p>American patriots, who feel that they should be on “their” government’s side regardless of the facts, would do well to remember what true patriotism is. For Americans, patriotism has always meant allegiance to the Constitution, not to the government. The oath is to defend the Constitution against enemies domestic and foreign. The Bush and Obama regimes have proven themselves to be the Constitution’s worst enemies. It is not possible for a true patriot to support a government that destroys the Constitution. The United States is the Constitution. Our country is not the Obama regime, the Bush regime, or some other administration. Our country is the Constitution. The Constitution is our country.</p>
<p>Beyond obligations to one’s own country, all humans have a responsibility to human life itself. Washington’s puppet states, such as the NATO countries, Japan, and Colombia, by providing cover and support for Washington’s aggression are enabling Washington to drive the world into World War III.</p>
<p>The temptation of Washington’s money easily overwhelms weak characters such as Tony Blair and David Cameron. But the governments of NATO countries and other accommodating states are not only selling out their own peoples by supporting Washington’s wars of aggression, they are selling out humanity. Washington’s hubris and arrogance grow as Washington bumps off country after country. Sooner or later Russia and China, will realize that they themselves are targets and will draw firmer lines. Arrogance will prevent Washington from acknowledging the lines, and the final war will be launched.</p>
<p>Washington’s hegemonic impulse is driving the world to destruction. The peoples of the world should realize this and force their governments to stop enabling Washington’s aggression.</p>

<p>In the 21st century the two hundred year-old propaganda that the American people control their government has been completely shattered. Both the Bush and Obama regimes have made it unmistakenly clear that the American people don’t even influence, much less control, the government. As far as Washington is concerned, the people are nothing but chaff in the wind.</p>
<p>Polls demonstrate that 65% of the US population opposes US intervention in Syria. Despite this clear indication of the people’s will, the Obama regime is ramping up a propaganda case for more arming of Washington’s mercenaries sent to overthrow the secular Syrian government and for a “no-fly zone” over Syria, which, if Libya is the example, means US or NATO aircraft attacking the Syrian army on the ground, thus serving as the air force of Washington’s imported mercenaries, euphemistically called “the Syrian rebels.”</p>
<p>Washington declared some time ago that the “red line” that would bring Syria under Washington’s military attack was the Assad government’s use of chemical weapons of mass destruction against Washington’s mercenaries. Once this announcement was made, everyone with a brain immediately knew that Washington would fabricate false intelligence that Assad had used chemical weapons, just as Washington presented to the United Nations the intentional lie via Secretary of State Colin Powell that Saddam Hussein in Iraq had dangerous weapons of mass destruction. Remember National Security Advisor Condi Rice’s image of a “mushroom cloud over American cities?” Propagandistic lies were Washington’s orders of the day.</p>
<p>And they still are. Now Washington has fabricated the false intelligence, and president obama has announced it with a straight face, that Syria’s Assad has used sarin gas on several occasions and that between 100 and 150 “of his own people,” a euphemism for the US supplied foreign mercenaries, have been killed by the weapon of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Think about that for a minute. As unfortunate as is any death from war, is 100-150 deaths “mass destruction?”  According to low-ball estimates, the US-sponsored foreign mercenary invasion of Syria has cost 93,000 lives, of which 150 deaths amounts to 0.0016. </p>
<p>In other words, 92,850 of the deaths did not cross the “red line.”  But 150 did, allegedly.</p>
<p>Yes, I know. Washington’s position makes no sense. But when has it ever made any sense?</p>
<p>Let’s stretch our minds just a tiny bit farther. Assad knows about Washington’s “red line.” It has been repeated over and over in order to create in the minds of the distracted American public that there is a real, valid reason for attacking Syria. Why would Assad use the proscribed weapons of mass destruction in order to kill a measly 100-150 mercenaries when his army is mopping up the US mercenaries without the use of gas and when Assad knows that the use of gas brings in the US military against him?</p>
<p>As the Russian government made clear, Washington’s accusation is not believable. No informed person could possibly believe it. No doubt, many Americans wearing patriotism on their sleeves will fall for Washington’s latest lie, but no one else in the world will. Even Washington’s NATO puppets calling for attacking Syria know that the justification for the attack is a lie. For the NATO puppets, Washington’s money overwhelms integrity, for which the rewards are low.</p>
<p>The Russians certainly know that Washington is lying. The Russian Foreign Minister Larov said: “The [Assad] government, as the opposition is saying openly, is enjoying military success on the ground. The [Assad] regime isn’t driven to the wall. What sense is there for the regime to use chemical arms&#8211;especially in such small amounts.” </p>
<p>Larov is a relatively civilized person in the role of Russia’s main diplomat. However, other Russian officials can be more pointed in their dismissal of Washington’s latest blatant lies. Yury Ushakov, an aide to Russian President Putin said: “The Americans tried to present us with information on the use of chemical weapons by the [Assad] regime, but frankly we thought that it was not convincing. We wouldn’t like to invoke references to [the infamous lies of] Secretary of State Powell [at the UN alleging Iraqi WMD], but the facts don’t look convincing in our eyes.” Aleksey Pushkov, the chairman of the Russian Duma’s Foreign Affairs Committee, cut to the chase. “The data about Assad’s use of chemical weapons is fabricated by the same facility that made up the lies about Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction. Obama is walking George W. Bush’s path.”</p>
<p>Here in America no one will ever hear straight talk like this from the US presstitutes.</p>
<p>Orwellian double-speak is now the language of the United States government. Secretary of State john kerry condemned Assad for harming “peace talks” while the US arms its Syrian mercenaries. </p>
<p>Washington’s double-speak is now obvious to the world. Not only Assad, but also the Russians, Chinese, Iranians, and every US puppet state which includes all of NATO and Japan, are fully aware that Washington is again lying through its teeth. The Russians, Chinese, and Iranians are trying to avoid confrontation with Washington, as war with the modern nuclear weapons would destroy all life on planet earth. What is striking is that despite 24/7 brainwashing by the presstitutes, a large majority of the American population opposes obama’s war on Syria.</p>
<p>This is good news. It means more Americans are developing the ability to think independently of the lies Washington feeds to them.</p>
<p>What the neocon nazis, the bush/obama regime, and the presstitute media have made clear is that Washington is going to push its agenda of world hegemony to the point of starting World War III, which, of course, means the end of life on earth.</p>
<p>Russia and China, either one of which can destroy the United States, have learned that the US government is a liar and cannot be trusted. The Libyan “no-fly” policy to which Russia and China agreed turned out to be a NATO air attack on the Libyan army so that the CIA-sponsored mercenaries could prevail. </p>
<p>Russia and China, having learned their lesson, are protesting Washington’s assault on Syria that Washington pretends is a “civil war.” If Syria falls, Russia and China know that Iran is next.</p>
<p>Iran is Russia’s underbelly, and for China Iran is 20% of its energy imports. Both Russian and Chinese governments know that after Iran falls, they are next. There is no other explanation for Washington surrounding Russia with missile bases and surrounding China with naval and air bases. </p>
<p>Both Russia and China are now preparing for the war that they see as inevitable. Washington’s crazed, demented drive for world hegemony is bringing unsuspecting Americans up against two countries with hydrogen bombs whose combined population is five times the US population. In such a conflict everyone dies. </p>
<p>Considering the utterly insane government ruling in Washington, if human life exists in 2020, it will be a miracle. All the worry about future Medicare and Social Security deficits is meaningless. There will be no one here to collect the benefits.</p>

<p>If you listen to the alarm coming out of the imperium empire media, you would think that missiles would be flying at any moment. That medieval torture regime noted for starving their population is boasting that a bellicose attack is imminent. Of course, their propagandists are pointing the finger at the Yankee bully that is the perennial bogyman posed to snuff out the <a href="http://www.korea-dpr.com/">Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea</a>. Such an earthly paradise is billed as a “<em>genuine workers&#8217; state in which all the people are completely liberated from exploitation and oppression. The workers, peasants, soldiers and intellectuals are the true masters of their destiny and are in a unique position to defend their interests.</em>”</p>
<p>Indeed such a freedom loving society takes pride in professing their government is the rightful leadership for the entire Korean peninsula. Such bold determination to dominate the imposter that has set up shop in the south must mean that the Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-Il dynasty will prevail. Both adopted the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea">Songun</a>, or &#8220;military-first&#8221; policy in order to strengthen the country and its government. North Korea is the world&#8217;s most militarized country, with a total of 9,495,000 active, reserve, and paramilitary personnel. Now the grand Kim Jong-un general in chief is ready to hit the nuke button as a sign of his manhood.</p>
<p>Does it really matter that <a href="http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/02/north-korea-defies-world-body-with-third-nuke-test/">North Korea Defies World Body with Third Nuke Test</a>, or is this just another opportunity for the world community to play the role of the white knight as it slays an infantile dragon that causes trepidation among his commie mentors?</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Still, three Security Council resolutions &#8211; in 2006, 2009 and 2013 &#8211; critical of North Korea&#8217;s nuclear program and tightening sanctions on Pyongyang &#8211; had the blessings of China, a permanent member with veto powers.</p>
<p>But the harshest of possible sanctions &#8211; a naval blockade, an oil embargo or a cutoff of economic aid from China &#8211; have escaped Security Council resolutions, at least so far.</p>
<p>The 15-member Council met in an emergency session Tuesday and issued a predictable statement condemning the test as &#8220;a grave violation&#8221; of its three resolutions and describing North Korea as a country which is &#8220;a clear threat to international peace and security&#8221;.”</p></blockquote>
<p>When the Guardian newspaper writes, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/dec/14/china-north-korea-diplomatic-meltdown">Now North Korea defies even China</a>, should we really believe that the true Asian tiger is powerless to reign in the unhinged stepchild.</p>
<blockquote><p>
“In this tense game of diplomatic-military poker, South Korea is not even the North&#8217;s principal adversary. Kim Jong-il is now blithely defying all the major regional actors &#8211; the US, China, Russia and Japan &#8211; while actively exploiting differences between them. It makes little difference whether his aim is recognition and security guarantees; economic and financial assistance; or the succession of his son. Kim is playing off the great powers against each other, to see what he can get out of them. The result is virtual diplomatic meltdown.</p>
<p>Just look at what has happened since last month&#8217;s bombardment of Yeonpyeong island. China, the North&#8217;s only influential ally, has come under strong US pressure to pull its supposed client into line. China&#8217;s perceived failure to do so is straining relations with Washington. James Steinberg, the US deputy secretary of state, visited Beijing today carrying the message: China must do more, fast.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/kw-chinter/chinter.htm">China</a> saved the original North Korean dictatorship from defeat with their intervention of troops back in November 1950. Mao and Stalin fired up the cold war into a blood stained conflict that never ended. The uneasy armistice at the cease of arms, supposedly now terminated, allows for active deployment of the most sophisticated weapons. Is this a fragile standoff or should the prudent student of the <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/index.html">global gulag</a> conclude, that the Chinese and even the Russians, are eager to confront the Western allies through a standalone surrogate?</p>
<p>The New York Times hints at the answer in the article, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-test.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">China Looms Over Response to Nuclear Test by North Korea</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
“The Chinese military, and to a lesser extent the International Liaison Department of the Chinese Communist Party, assert strong influence on China&#8217;s Korea policy, and both powerful entities prefer to keep North Korea close at hand, Chinese and American analysts say.</p>
<p>While the People&#8217;s Liberation Army is not even able to conduct military exercises with the North Koreans &#8211; the government in the North forbids such contact with outsiders &#8211; Chinese military strategists adhere to the doctrine that they cannot afford to abandon their ally, no matter how bad its behavior, analysts here say.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Chinese Communist Party looks upon the North Korean Communist Party &#8211; led by Kim Jong-un, the grandson of the nation&#8217;s founder &#8211; as a fraternal brotherhood. Indeed, relations between the two countries are conducted largely between the two parties rather than between the two foreign ministries, the more normal diplomatic channel.</p>
<p>In an early sign that Mr. Xi is unlikely to veer from past policy, the state-run news agency, Xinhua, criticized the United States and its allies for essentially forcing the North&#8217;s aggression by causing the country to feel insecure.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Blame the U.S. for causing insecurity, when the sordid record of capitulation to the repeated game of North Korean chicken, resembles a farmers feed the world that largely benefits corporate agriculture. Putting and keeping Kim Jong-un on a short choke chain leash is certainly within the power of the Chinese.</p>
<p>Since China is the preferred economic model of the globalists and North Korea is the chosen police state version for social repression, what possible reason would China have to intervene by stopping the challenge to the American military?</p>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qpmI7ECNfRk" height="315" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Storm Clouds Gathering video, <a href="http://youtu.be/qpmI7ECNfRk">The North Korean Nuclear Crisis What You Aren&#8217;t being Told</a>, provides a perceptive analysis of the current confrontation.</p>
<p>The proper method to interpret Sino-American foreign policy is through a lens of transnational monopoly control. The real masters of Asian industrialization and American decline operate above and beyond national sovereignty. The best explanation of perceived unstable skirmishes that lead to deployed conflicts, must accept that it is good business for the globalists to keep tensions high with frequent warfare.</p>
<p>The bondage cult that adores the North Korean regime is an expendable ritual killer machine that excels in making threats, but comes up short, when faced with superior force defense. The mission assigned for North Korea is to stir the pot for state of war stress, while backing down without losing face domestically.</p>
<p>Defense News offers a familiar establishment appeasement attitude viewpoint in the report, <a href="http://www.defensenews.com/article/20130310/DEFREG03/303100003/Has-China-Had-Enough-N-Korean-Antics-Maybe-Not?odyssey=tab%7Ctopnews%7Ctext%7CFRONTPAGE">Has China Had Enough of N. Korean Antics? Maybe Not</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="korea.jpg" src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/korea.jpg" align="left" /></p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;North Korea&#8217;s continuous provocations defying China&#8217;s demands, warnings and brazen neglect of China&#8217;s key strategic and security interests certainly drive many in China, both in the public and among elites, to &#8216;soul-searching&#8217; on its North Korea policy,&#8221; said Wang Dong, director, School of International Studies, Center for Northeast Asian Strategic Studies, Peking University, Beijing.</p>
<p>China will join the international community in tightening sanctions against the regime, &#8220;but it will also carefully ensure the sanctions do not &#8216;threaten&#8217; another key goal of China, which is peace and stability on the Korean peninsula,&#8221; Wang said.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Get real folks! The notion that North Korea is defying Chinese interests is ridiculous. The actual international community consensus that controls worldwide politics, seeks to dismantle the global influence of America and deepen damage on the U.S. political system.</p>
<p>Fear of a nuclear exchange with Kim Jong-un military is rooted in the false premise that North Korea can and would operate separately from Chinese or Russian direction. Ratcheting up the threats makes high drama, but produces a low probability for an actual attack.</p>
<p>The prospects for direct negotiations with the AmeriKan “Beloved Leader”, Barack Hussein Obama might well take place at a Tehran Conference II. What a great diplomatic coup for a peacemaker of banksters’ interests to immerge as the capitulator in chief. Averting WWIII by compliance and singing an international ecumenical anthem is the ultimate game plan from this latest trumped up crisis.</p>
<p>Do not rule out a false flag incident. The dogs of war like to play in the killing fields of properly planned out maneuvers. However, that threatened surge of a 10 million horde, breaching the 38th parallel, has a greater likelihood that the rush would be to seize Samsung electronics, than to mop up the debris from depleted uranium.</p>
<p>An inevitable World War III will be fought under the direction of unworldly principalities. Kim Jong-un is a cartoon caricature and a paper tiger, more suited for his 15 minutes of fame, than a reincarnated Napoleon.</p>
<p>Watch for the real fallout from this episode of “<em>true grit</em>”. Keep your eye on the monetary radioactive dust cloud. The threat of war is the best cover for a heist of global propositions. When in trouble, the great powers mobilize for pillage. The North Korea gulag is a nightmare that readies replication for the rest of the world. The cabal of globalists is the actual warmongers.</p>
