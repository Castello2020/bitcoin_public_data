<p>What happens when an institution becomes more important than the cause for which the institution was formed? How long should people who believe in the cause remain loyal to such an institution? And at what point does loyalty to such an institution comprise an abandonment of the cause itself?</p>
<p>I’m afraid the majority of Americans have been institutionalized in a manner not unlike the way prisoners are institutionalized after a long period of confinement. After a point, a prisoner is so conditioned to accepting the circumstances of his confinement that, should he be released from confinement, he truly would be unable to cope. Such seems to be the mentality of a majority of us today.</p>
<p>Christians have been institutionalized. The reason and purpose of the church or Christian organization is no longer relevant. Generations have grown up reciting the same liturgies, regurgitating the same prayers, and rehearsing the same programs until the reason for it all doesn’t even matter. But take the institution away from them, and they would not be able to cope.</p>
<p>The Pharisees despised the Lord Jesus because He challenged the religious institutions that had come to govern people’s lives. I am convinced if Jesus came to America today, He would be just as despised by the vast majority of our religious leaders as He was by the Pharisees.</p>
<p>The Church that Jesus built in the Book of Acts owned no buildings, was indebted to no lenders, took no tax benefits from the civil government, had no denominational hierarchy, and identified itself with no ecclesiastical brand. And the Church was just as persecuted by the religious establishment as Christ was.</p>
<p>One of the reasons one may know that the modern church is so unlike Christ and the apostles is by the persecution that it never experiences. Just as the Pharisees were bosom buddies with the Roman Empire’s governing elite, so are our religious leaders today. Caesar was very generous in sharing the fruit of his tyrannically-extracted bounty with his allies in the Jewish Sanhedrin. And they were happy to return the favor by insisting that the Hebrew people submit to Caesar’s harsh rule over their lives.</p>
<p>The Pharisees also enjoyed a cozy relationship with the moneychangers. The moneychangers were descended from a long line of corrupt banking interests that dated all the way back to the Edomites. We are not talking about your friendly local banker here. These were highly organized, well-positioned money-manipulators. Jesus was so incensed with their manipulation and theft within in the Temple that he used physical violence to remove them from the property. He is recorded as doing this twice in the Gospel narratives. Note that after the second time in which it is recorded that He drove out the moneychangers (with a whip, no less), the Pharisees soon had Jesus crucified. There is no question that one of the reasons Pilate ordered Jesus to be scourged with a whip was in direct retaliation for the manner in which Jesus whipped the moneychangers. Remember, the moneychangers were from a very well-ensconced, elitist national (and even international) organization.</p>
<p>And lest you think all of this is irrelevant to today, the moneychangers are still very much with us. The Rothschilds, Rockefellers, and other members of the international banking elite, are the direct descendants of the moneychangers of Jesus’ day. And if you ever have an opportunity to ask one of them about it, they will proudly admit it.</p>
<p>Yes, the Pharisees institutionalized religion. This accomplished two things: 1) it helped enslave the people, 2) it helped make them rich. The institutionalized church is accomplishing much the same things today.</p>
<p>The establishment church is doing as much to enslave people as any other institution in the world. Our political institutions and educational institutions have nothing on the church for making good little subjects and serfs to the all-powerful state. And if you don’t think that a host of church leaders are not reaping the spoils from assisting our taskmasters, you’re not paying attention.</p>
<p>Many, if not most, of these big-name TV evangelists have as many houses and yachts and Swiss bank accounts as any big-name Hollywood actor or politician. In some cases, more. Most of these big-church pastors are bathing in luxury. Many of them take the kinds of vacations that only CEOs of the biggest corporations or presidents could afford. Do you really think that the IRS rules and regulations governing these non-profit corporations, called churches, really bother these church leaders? Get real!</p>
<p>No wonder all of these “successful” preachers are constantly teaching their congregations to always submit to the government. No wonder they have no interest in abandoning their 501c3 tax-exempt status. They are in the exact same position as were the Pharisees of old. And they are just as effective in helping to enslave people today as were the Pharisees.</p>
<p>The institution of the church&#8211;along with its programs, formalities, buildings, rituals, etc.,&#8211;has become more important than the purpose for which the church was created. Instead of preaching the liberating message of the Cross, which frees men from the fetters of sin&#8211;and that includes sinful political and financial fetters&#8211;the church is preaching a message of subjugation and enslavement. It is teaching people to submit to all kinds of oppression, including religious oppression.</p>
<p>Some of the most oppressed and subjugated people in the world are religious people. There are churches and Christian colleges that are every bit as tyrannical as anything coming out of East-bloc or Muslim countries. About the only thing missing is physical torture and execution. Spiritually, however, the oppression is the same.</p>
<p>How could real men who love the liberty they have in Christ allow themselves&#8211;and especially their wives&#8211;to be told how to dress, how to wear their hair, what kind of music to listen to, what kind of vacations to take, what restaurants they may or may not eat at, what forms of entertainment they may or may not participate in, etc., etc., ad infinitum?</p>
<p>I tell you the truth: many Christians in America are already slaves. To talk to them about freedom is a complete waste of time. The chains of tyranny are already clamped around their hearts. Why should it matter to them if chains are clamped around their necks? When they talk about “defending the faith,” they are talking about defending the institution. They are slaves to the institution. And the same is true for many unchurched Americans.</p>
<p>What is more important: liberty, or the government that is supposed to secure liberty? To a sizeable number of Americans today, it is more important to preserve the institution than the freedoms that the institution was created to protect.</p>
<p>Our Declaration of Independence states, “That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends [the God-given rights of life, liberty, etc.], it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.”</p>
<p>Did you see that: “any form of government”? ANY FORM. The form of government is only as good as its ability to secure liberty.</p>
<p>I hear a lot of politicians and media personalities talking about “American exceptionalism.” This is a potentially dangerous mindset. If one means that America is exceptional in our history and the manner in which our Constitution and Bill of Rights were established to protect liberty, well and good. But if it means that America has carte-blanche to do anything it wants&#8211;no matter how unconstitutional or tyrannical&#8211;because it is “exceptional,” it is a bunch of hooey.</p>
<p>What difference does it make if we have a 50-State Union or not? There is a bill in the California legislature that would divide that State into six states. Five counties in Western Maryland are trying to secede from Baltimore. Ten northern counties in Colorado are trying to secede from Denver. If a State refuses to secure the liberties of the people of that State, they have every right under God to separate. The State is not nearly as important as the liberties of the people within the State.</p>
<p>The spirit of secession is actually growing like wildfire all over the world. In recent history, Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Kosovo all separated from Yugoslavia. Transnistria broke free from Moldova. Abkhazia and South Ossetia fought free from Georgia. The Slovaks seceded from Czechoslovakia. And now Crimea is separating from Ukraine.</p>
<p>To be sure, not every country that secedes from another country is motivated purely by the love of liberty. But for those of us in America, the issue that has propelled the desire to separate from one country or one State has always been liberty. It was the love of liberty that created the United States and that created the free and independent states of Maine, Vermont, Kentucky, and West Virginia&#8211;all of which seceded from existing U.S. states.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what difference does it make if Washington, D.C., is our federal capital, or, if say, Helena, Montana, would become the federal capital of a mountain state confederation of Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Northern Colorado, eastern Washington and Oregon, the Dakotas, Alberta and British Columbia, Canada, and Alaska? Or if Austin was the federal capital of an independent Republic of Texas? Preserving some sort of political union (especially if it is a forced and coerced union) is not nearly as important as preserving liberty.</p>
<p>Again, it is not the political institution that is important. What is important is the liberty that the political institution is supposed to secure.</p>
<p>Many great minds in this country are already philosophizing over the possibility that secession is an idea whose time has come&#8211;again. A few years ago, Walter Williams wrote, “Like a marriage that has gone bad, I believe there are enough irreconcilable differences between those who want to control and those want to be left alone that divorce is the only peaceable alternative. Just as in a marriage, where vows are broken, our human rights protections guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution have been grossly violated by a government instituted to protect them. Americans who are responsible for and support constitutional abrogation have no intention of mending their ways.</p>
<p>“Americans who wish to live free have two options: We can resist, fight and risk bloodshed to force America&#8217;s tyrants to respect our liberties and human rights, or we can seek a peaceful resolution of our irreconcilable differences by separating. That can be done by peopling several states, say Texas and Louisiana, control their legislatures and then issue a unilateral declaration of independence just as the Founders did in 1776. You say, ‘Williams, nobody has to go that far, just get involved in the political process and vote for the right person.’ That&#8217;s nonsense. Liberty shouldn&#8217;t require a vote. It&#8217;s a God-given or natural right.</p>
<p>“Some independence or secessionists movements, such as our 1776 war with England and our 1861 War Between the States, have been violent, but they need not be. In 1905, Norway seceded from Sweden, Panama seceded from Columbia (1903), and West Virginia from Virginia (1863). Nonetheless, violent secession can lead to great friendships. England is probably our greatest ally and we have fought three major wars together. There is no reason why Texiana (Texas and Louisiana) couldn&#8217;t peaceably secede, be an ally, and have strong economic ties with United States.</p>
<p>“The bottom line question for all of us is should we part company or continue trying to forcibly impose our wills on one another?”</p>
<p>See William’s column here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fchuckbaldwinlive.com%2FArticles%2Ftabid%2F109%2FID%2F1149%2FInstitutionalized-Tyranny.aspx&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG1RS7GDjYF35eP0TqKh9wrKVsJJA" target="_blank">It&#8217;s Time To Part Company</a></p>
<p>Hear! Hear!</p>
<p>In the eyes of God, marriage is the most sacred of all unions. It is far more sacred than any political union. If our Creator has authorized the separation of a husband and wife under certain circumstances in which one party violated the sacred terms of the holy contract (and He has), who among us has the audacity to say that political unions may not be abandoned when government commits political adultery by forsaking its oath to the people?</p>
<p>Again, are we more interested in preserving an institution or the liberty that the institution is supposed to secure?</p>
<p>As an institution, the Church at large is apostate. Yet, millions of Christians continue to prop up an institution that has abandoned the purpose for which it was created. They are more interested in preserving the forms and liturgies and tapestries and buildings of the institution. And, all the while, they are being spiritually enslaved by the very institution they are helping to prop up.</p>
<p>And as an institution, the U.S. federal government is apostate. Yet, millions of citizens continue to make excuses for it, justify it, and condone it. They are more interested in preserving the agencies and entities and power of the institution. Yet, all the while, they are being enslaved by the very institution they are helping to prop up.</p>
<p>What happens when an institution becomes more important than the cause for which the institution was formed? When the institution is civil government and the cause is liberty, tyranny is what happens.</p>

<p>Conservatives are generally very nice people — who never saw a culture war they couldn’t lose. That is to say, we often hear cracks about how Barack Obama and his ilk may “evolve” on issues, but conservatives exhibit that tendency, too, and their evolution goes something like this:</p>
<p>“Marriage is between one man and one woman, period!”</p>
<p>Five years later…</p>
<p>“I can accept civil unions, but marriage shouldn’t be redefined.”</p>
<p>After five years more:</p>
<p>“The states can do whatever they want, just keep the feds out of it.”</p>
<p>And 10 years further on:</p>
<p>“People can do what they want. How does faux marriage affect me, anyway?” (This is the point British “conservatives” have reached.)</p>
<p>And at an even later juncture it’s, “Why shouldn’t homosexuals have the right to ‘marry’? It’s a matter of equality.” (Just ask some “conservatives” in Sweden.)</p>
<p>Oh, this isn’t limited to marriage or anything else some dismiss as “social issues.” Conservatives were against Social Security (in FDR’s time) before they tolerated it before they were for it before they demanded it. And they are against socialized medicine. But should it endure for 15 years, their children will tolerate it and then accept it and then expect it — as today’s conservatives do in Western Europe.</p>
<p>This gets at the only consistent definition of conservatism: a desire to “conserve,” to preserve the status quo. This is why while 1950s conservatives in the US were staunchly anti-communist, conservatives in the USSR<i>were</i> communist. As the status quo changes, so does the nature of the prevailing conservatism. And it is liberals, as the agents of change (without the hope), who shape tomorrow’s status quo.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: the liberals come to the bargaining table demanding a change. The conservatives don’t like it, but being “reasonable” they give the other side some part of what they want. And it doesn’t matter if it amounts to 50 percent, 30, 15 or just 1 percent.</p>
<p>Because the libs will be back, next year, next election cycle, next decade.</p>
<p>Again and again and again.</p>
<p>And each time the cons will get conned, giving the libs a few more slices, until the left has the whole loaf and those ideological loafers, conservatives, are left with crumbs and a crumbled culture.</p>
<p>In a word, today’s conservatives are generally people who have <i>assimilated</i> into yesterday’s liberals’ culture. And every time we compromise — on civil unions, big-government programs or whatever it may be — we assimilate further. And what is the nature of this evolution?</p>
<p>It is nothing less than a superior culture being subsumed by an inferior one.</p>
<p>Now, all this perhaps sounds hopeless. Are we damned to inexorable and irrevocable movement toward the “left,” at least until the complete collapse of civilization is wrought? Well, there is an alternative to assimilation.</p>
<p>Separation.</p>
<p>There has been some talk of secession lately. But note that there is a prerequisite for political separation: cultural separation. Serbia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Slovenia didn’t become their own nations because they suddenly thought the name Yugoslavia was no longer cool, but because of profound cultural differences. And Catalans in Spain some time back empowered parties that have called for an independence referendum this year because of cultural differences. Make the cultural differences great enough, and separation (assuming you can avoid bondage via a governmental iron fist, which is the other possibility) is a natural by-product.</p>
<p>But a key to increasing that cultural divide is avoiding assimilation. Did you ever hear of an Ainu (Japan’s original people) independence movement in Japan? No, because they’ve been largely absorbed by the wider culture, sort of how traditionalists get absorbed by our modernistic culture and end up having, at best, children who’ll reflect today’s liberals and be called tomorrow’s conservatives. So how can further assimilation be avoided?</p>
<p>We only need to look at how it’s done all over the world. And there are two ways. To illustrate the first, consider how ardent Muslims avoid being subsumed. They don’t view fellow citizens in a host nation as national brothers.</p>
<p>But as the “other.”</p>
<p>Oh, the others may occupy the same borders, but they are as alien as anyone outside them. Their culture is to be rejected not just because it’s decadent and despicable — and our liberal-created variety is certainly those things — but because it is <i>of </i>the other. So it is with the others’ laws, social codes, and traditions, too: they are born of an infidel, alien culture and are to be viewed with extreme suspicion if not hostility.</p>
<p>And this is precisely how leftists should be viewed.</p>
<p>For this to work, our instincts must be thus: If liberals say left, we go right. If they say down, we say up. If they scream “Change!” we shout all the louder “Tradition!” and then push for our own change — tradition’s restoration.</p>
<p>Note here that I’m not speaking of a cold intellectual understanding of the issues, which, don’t get me wrong, is important. But just as it is passion that makes a man fight for a woman, it is passion that makes you fight for a cause. Loathe what the liberals stand for, meet their agenda with animosity, cultivate a visceral desire to wipe it from the face of the Earth. Hate, hate, <i>hate</i> it with the fires of a thousand burning suns.</p>
<p>One drawback to this tactic for division, however, is that it constitutes a blind defiance that could conceivably reject virtue along with vice. An example of this is when elements of the black community dismiss education, Christianity and higher culture because they view embracing them as “acting white.” Yet since liberals are right only about 0.4 percent of the time (and I’m perhaps being generous), this isn’t the greatest of dangers at the moment. Nonetheless, this brings us to the ideal method for separation.</p>
<p>G.K. Chesterton once said, “The true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him, but because he loves what is behind him.” A good example of love-driven separation is the Amish. They do try to avoid hating anyone (although I suspect they hate certain ideas), yet their love for their culture is so great that they remain a people apart. Of course, where they fall short is that they won’t fight at all, even politically. And this philosophy will not yield separation on a wide scale because the left simply won’t allow millions of people to live “off the grid.” Someone has to fund the nanny state, after all.</p>
<p>But the proper combination is obvious. We need sort of an Amish jihad, a deep love of the good and hatred of the evil that translates into action. But there is a prerequisite for this, and it brings us to something both the Amish and Muslim jihadists have in common.</p>
<p>They believe in Truth.</p>
<p>Sure, the Muslims may call it the will of Allah; the Amish, God’s law. But the point is that they aren’t awash in a relativism that, amounting to the Protagorean notion that “man is the measure of all things,” is unduly influenced by man. They don’t see a large number of people lobbying for some loony social innovation and figure that, with man as arbiter, they have to “get with the times.” Rooted to what they see as eternal, they don’t bend to the ephemeral.</p>
<p>Quite the opposite of G.W. Bush, I’m a divider — not a uniter. If this sounds bad, note that Jesus himself said He had not come to unite the world but as a sword to divide brother against brother. And while I certainly don’t claim to be God or even godly, I do know that tolerance of evil in unity’s name is a vice — and blessed division a virtue.</p>
<p>We can hate what is in front of us, love what is behind us, or both. But if we’re sheep and not soldiers, compromisers and not crusaders, Western civilization’s days will be behind us — and in front, perhaps, a thousand years of darkness.</p>

</div>
<p>In March of 1836, a young man of twenty-three years of age took his sword out of its scabbard and drew a line in the sand in front of an old mission outside of San Antonio, Texas, and called on the men defending that mission who were willing to stay on the ramparts and face an opposing army more than ten times their number to signify their commitment by stepping across the line. Of course, the young man was William Barrett Travis and the old mission was the Alamo. He could not have known it then, but Travis’ line in the sand would forever become the benchmark by which all future acts of commitment would be measured. In a mystical way, but, then again, in very real way, Travis’ line in the sand is being drawn again. Oh, it may not be a line in dirt drawn by the point of a sword; it is a line in the hearts of men being drawn by the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>My last three columns (not including the column promoting THE FREEDOM DOCUMENTS) generated more responses than any three columns I have ever written, and I have been writing this column for some fifteen years. At first, the responses were mostly negative and often vitriolic. But this past week, responses have been over 90% positive and very enthusiastic. I am confident that the manner in which these columns have brought out intense emotion and determination on both sides is a microcosm of what is happening nationally. A line in the sand for freedom is being drawn once again.</p>
<p>This line in the sand for freedom is separating people in a major way. And this is not necessarily a bad thing. In the same way that God commanded Abram to separate from his home and kin, so, too, the Spirit of God is separating people many times from their friends, their neighbors, their kinfolk, and, yes, their church families. I seem to recall that during the period of the early church, the conflict of principle forever separated the apostles Paul and Silas. And during America’s War for Independence, the conflict of principle separated Benjamin Franklin and his son William&#8211;as it did tens of thousands of others.</p>
<p>Perhaps not since the days of Patrick Henry, Sam Adams, et al., have Americans been forced to deal&#8211;intellectually, reasonably, emotionally, volitionally, and spiritually&#8211;with the fundamental issues of liberty as we are being forced to do today. For way too long, Americans have taken freedom for granted. For way too long, our educational and religious institutions (not to mention our homes) have not taught the fundamental principles of liberty. This negligence has brought our country to the brink of oppression and despotism. And, just as was the case in Colonial America, a line in the sand for freedom is being drawn in the hearts of men.</p>
<p>This internal line in the sand is being drawn irrespective of a person’s education, temperament, upbringing, intelligence, or faith. While some men seem to be content to live under the heel of governmental oppression, many others have an innate thirst for freedom that all of the armies in the world cannot quench.</p>
<p>In truth, the thirst for freedom is part of Natural Law. A horse is not broken without a fight; a tiger or lion will pace its cage as long as it can walk looking for an avenue of escape; a bird will fly around its cage ten thousand times looking for an opening to return to the sky. Yes, animals can be broken&#8211;and so can be some men, unfortunately. But the innate desire for freedom is born in the soul of every man.</p>
<p>However, the desire for comfort, ease, and material pleasure is a handsome tempter that many people find more attractive than the harsh and weather-torn face of liberty. Plus, the further liberty slips out of view, the more vague the memory of it becomes. And before we realize it, the face of liberty is only seen in the irrelevant relics of the songs and statues of history. But it is exactly at this point that the Spirit of God begins to renew in the hearts of men the Natural thirst for liberty. And that is precisely what is happening now.</p>
<p>All over America, and, yes, all over the world, people’s hearts are beating fast for freedom. I am receiving thousands of letters and emails from people all over the globe. Unfortunately for many of these people, they do not live in a country in which the governmental and political foundation and structure is conducive to the reclamation of liberty. But in the United States, it is not a matter of government; it is a matter of will. Do the American people yet have the will to reclaim liberty?</p>
<p>While it would appear that the majority of today’s Americans have allowed ignorance, materialism, and false Bible teaching regarding the principles of liberty to suppress their love of liberty, I am absolutely convinced that the spirit of liberty is swelling in the hearts of teeming millions of people. Highly educated and high school dropouts, affluent and average, Christians and unchurched, men and women, young and old: their hearts are ablaze with the love of liberty. And they are no longer content to surround themselves with those who would allow the chains of servitude to be clamped around their necks.</p>
<p>Are we patriots or loyalists? That question had to be answered by every man and woman in Colonial America. The same question must be answered by every American today. Are we going to bravely fight for the principles of liberty as did our patriot forebears, or are we going to be loyal to a corrupt and tyrannical system that is literally choking the life out of our freedoms? And how each of us answers that question will determine the direction and destination of our lives and futures.</p>
<p>The freedom to separate is a Natural right. Forced union is not a union at all; it is enslavement. The current world and U.S. maps are testimonies to the right of Natural separation. Pat Buchanan recently wrote:</p>
<p>“In the last decade of the 20th century, as the Soviet Empire disintegrated, so, too, did that prison house of nations, the USSR.</p>
<p>“Out of the decomposing carcass came Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Moldova, all in Europe; Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus; and Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in Central Asia.</p>
<p>“Transnistria then broke free of Moldova, and Abkhazia and South Ossetia fought free of Georgia.</p>
<p>“Yugoslavia dissolved far more violently into the nations of Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Macedonia and Kosovo.</p>
<p>“The Slovaks seceded from Czechoslovakia.”</p>
<p>Buchanan also notes that in the U.S., “Four of our 50 states&#8211;Maine, Vermont, Kentucky, West Virginia&#8211;were born out of other states.”</p>
<p>See Pat’s column at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wnd.com%2F2013%2F10%2Fis-red-state-america-seceding%2F%23AiaabIMwzZPjVbIp.99&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEs1mWJI91tXEz8Sd8N1hT7_2yR-g" target="_blank">Is Red State America Seceding?</a></p>
<p>Think of this, too: the most fundamental and sacred union of all is the union of a man and woman in marriage. Had Adam and Eve not fallen into sin, there would, no doubt, be no right or reason for separation. (Matthew 19:8) But with the fall of man into sin came all kinds of abuse. As a result, the Scriptures grant divorce (separation) on the grounds of both adultery (Matthew 19) and abandonment (I Corinthians 7). While never preferred, few among us would deny the right of a husband or wife to separate under certain circumstances. Because not every man is willing to be governed by the Natural and revealed laws of God, men are granted the right to separate themselves from those who would violate the fundamental principles upon which the union is based. This is true maritally, ecclesiastically, spiritually, socially, and politically.</p>
<p>In 1836, Will Travis drew a line in the sand to separate those who were willing to defend the liberty of Texas on the ramparts of the Alamo from those who were not. And I am convinced that God is drawing a line in the hearts of men today for the same reason: to separate those who are willing to give their lives in the defense of liberty from those who are not. And, ironically, the freedom of everyone&#8211;including the ones who are not willing to defend it&#8211;depends on the willingness of the ones who are. I guess it’s always been that way.</p>
<p>I know which side of the line I am on; and after the deluge of correspondence I have received over the past couple of weeks, I know I am not alone.</p>

<blockquote><p>“U.S. hopes of winning more influence over Syria’s divided rebel movement faded Wednesday after 11 of the biggest armed factions repudiated the Western-backed political opposition coalition and announced the formation of an alliance dedicated to creating an Islamist state. The al-Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra, designated a terrorist organization by the United States, is the lead signatory of the new group.” 1</p></blockquote>
<p>Pity the poor American who wants to be a good citizen, wants to understand the world and his country’s role in it, wants to believe in the War on Terrorism, wants to believe that his government seeks to do good … What is he to make of all this?</p>
<p>For about two years, his dear American government has been supporting the same anti-government side as the jihadists in the Syrian civil war; not total, all-out support, but enough military hardware, logistics support, intelligence information, international political, diplomatic and propaganda assistance (including the crucial alleged-chemical-weapons story), to keep the jihadists in the ball game. Washington and its main Mideast allies in the conflict – Turkey, Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia – have not impeded the movement to Syria of jihadists coming to join the rebels, recruited from the ranks of Sunni extremist veterans of the wars in Chechnya, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya, while Qatar and the Saudis have supplied the rebels with weapons, most likely bought in large measure from the United States, as well as lots of of what they have lots of – money.</p>
<p>This widespread international support has been provided despite the many atrocities carried out by the jihadists – truck and car suicide bombings (with numerous civilian casualties), planting roadside bombs à la Iraq, gruesome massacres of Christians and Kurds, grotesque beheadings and other dissections of victims’ bodies (most charming of all: a Youtube video of a rebel leader cutting out an organ from the chest of a victim and biting into it as it drips with blood). All this barbarity piled on top of a greater absurdity – these Western-backed, anti-government forces are often engaged in battle with other Western-backed, anti-government forces, non-jihadist. It has become increasingly difficult to sell this war to the American public as one of pro-democracy “moderates” locked in a good-guy-versus-bad-guy struggle with an evil dictator, although in actuality the United States has fought on the same side as al Qaeda on repeated occasions before Syria. Here’s a brief survey:</p>
<p><strong>Afghanistan, 1980-early 1990s:</strong> In support of the Islamic <em>Moujahedeen</em> (“holy warriors”), the CIA orchestrated a war against the Afghan government and their Soviet allies, pouring in several billions of dollars of arms and extensive military training; hitting up Middle-Eastern countries for donations, notably Saudi Arabia which gave hundreds of millions of dollars in aid each year; pressuring and bribing Pakistan to rent out its country as a military staging area and sanctuary.</p>
<p>It worked. And out of the victorious <em>Moujahedeen</em> came al Qaeda.</p>
<p><strong>Bosnia, 1992-5:</strong> In 2001 the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> declared:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is safe to say that the birth of al-Qaeda as a force on the world stage can be traced directly back to 1992, when the Bosnian Muslim government of Alija Izetbegovic issued a passport in their Vienna embassy to Osama bin Laden. … for the past 10 years, the most senior leaders of al Qaeda have visited the Balkans, including bin Laden himself on three occasions between 1994 and 1996. The Egyptian surgeon turned terrorist leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri has operated terrorist training camps, weapons of mass destruction factories and money-laundering and drug-trading networks throughout Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Turkey and Bosnia. This has gone on for a decade. 2</p></blockquote>
<p>A few months later, <em>The Guardian</em> reported on “the full story of the secret alliance between the Pentagon and radical Islamist groups from the Middle East designed to assist the Bosnian Muslims – some of the same groups that the Pentagon is now fighting in “the war against terrorism”. 3</p>
<p>In 1994 and 1995 US/NATO forces carried out bombing campaigns over Bosnia aimed at damaging the military capability of the Serbs and enhancing that of the Bosnian Muslims. In the decade-long civil wars in the Balkans, the Serbs, regarded by Washington as the “the last communist government in Europe”, were always the main enemy.</p>
<p><strong>Kosovo, 1998-99:</strong> Kosovo, overwhelmingly Muslim, was a province of Serbia, the main republic of the former Yugoslavia. In 1998, Kosovo separatists – The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) – began an armed conflict with Belgrade to split Kosovo from Serbia. The KLA was considered a terrorist organization by the US, the UK and France for years, with numerous reports of the KLA having contact with al-Qaeda, getting arms from them, having its militants trained in al-Qaeda camps in Pakistan, and even having members of al-Qaeda in KLA ranks fighting against the Serbs. 4</p>
<p>However, when US-NATO forces began military action against the Serbs the KLA was taken off the US terrorist list, it “received official US-NATO arms and training support” 5 , and the 1999 US-NATO bombing campaign eventually focused on driving Serbian forces from Kosovo.</p>
<p>In 2008 Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia, an independence so illegitimate and artificial that the majority of the world’s nations still have not recognized it. But the United States was the first to do so, the very next day, thus affirming the unilateral declaration of independence of a part of another country’s territory.</p>
<p>The KLA have been known for their trafficking in women, heroin, and human body parts (sic). The United States has naturally been pushing for Kosovo’s membership in NATO and the European Union.</p>
<p><em>Nota bene:</em> In 1992 the Bosnian Muslims, Croats, and Serbs reached agreement in Lisbon for a unified state. The continuation of a peaceful multi-ethnic Bosnia seemed assured. But the United States sabotaged the agreement. <a id="ref-6-a" href="http://williamblum.org/aer/read/121#fn-6-a">6</a></p>
<p><strong>Libya, 2011:</strong> The US and NATO to the rescue again. For more than six months, almost daily missile attacks against the government and forces of Muammar Gaddafi as assorted Middle East jihadists assembled in Libya and battled the government on the ground. The predictable outcome came to be – the jihadists now in control of parts of the country and fighting for the remaining parts. The wartime allies showed their gratitude to Washington by assassinating the US ambassador and three other Americans, presumably CIA, in the city of Benghazi.</p>
<p><strong>Caucasus (Russia), mid-2000s to present:</strong> The National Endowment for Democracy and Freedom House have for many years been the leading American “non-government” institutions tasked with destabilizing, if not overthrowing, foreign governments which refuse to be subservient to the desires of US foreign policy. Both NGOs have backed militants in the Russian Caucasus area, one that has seen more than its share of terror stretching back to the Chechnyan actions of the 1990s. 7</p>
<h3>“Omission is the most powerful form of lie.” – George Orwell</h3>
<p>I am asked occasionally why I am so critical of the mainstream media when I quote from them repeatedly in my writings. The answer is simple. The American media’s gravest shortcoming is much more their errors of omission than their errors of commission. It’s what they leave out that distorts the news more than any factual errors or out-and-out lies. So I can make good use of the facts they report, which a large, rich organization can easier provide than the alternative media.</p>
<p>A case in point is a <em>New York Times</em> article of October 5 on the Greek financial crisis and the Greeks’ claim for World War Two reparations from Germany.</p>
<p>“Germany may be Greece’s stern banker now, say those who are seeking reparations,” writes the<em>Times</em>, but Germany “should pay off its own debts to Greece. … It is not just aging victims of the Nazi occupation who are demanding a full accounting. Prime Minister Antonis Samarass government has compiled an 80-page report on reparations and a huge, never-repaid loan the nation was forced to make under Nazi occupation from 1941 to 1945. … The call for reparations has elicited an emotional outpouring in Greece, where six years of brutal recession and harsh austerity measures have left many Greeks hostile toward Germany. Rarely does a week go by without another report in the news about, as one newspaper put it in a headline, ‘What Germany Owes Us’.”</p>
<p>“The figure most often discussed is $220 billion, an estimate for infrastructure damage alone put forward by Manolis Glezos, a member of Parliament and a former resistance fighter who is pressing for reparations. That amount equals about half the country’s debt. … Some members of the National Council on Reparations, an advocacy group, are calling for more than $677 billion to cover stolen artifacts, damage to the economy and to the infrastructure, as well as the bank loan and individual claims.”</p>
<p>So there we have the morality play: The evil Germans who occupied Greece and in addition to carrying out a lot of violence and repression shamelessly exploited the Greek people economically.</p>
<p>Would it be appropriate for such a story, or an accompanying or follow-up story, to mention the civil war that broke out in Greece shortly after the close of the world war? On one side were the neo-fascists, many of whom had cooperated with the occupying Germans during the war, some even fighting for the Nazis. Indeed, the British Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, acknowledged in August 1946 that there were 228 ex-members of the Nazi Security Battalions – whose main task had been to track down Greek resistance fighters and Jews – on active service in the new Greek army. 8</p>
<p>On the other side was the Greek left who had fought the Nazis courageously, even forcing the German army to flee the country in 1944.</p>
<p>So guess which side of the civil war our favorite military took? … That’s right, the United States supported the neo-fascists. After all, an important component of the Greek left was the Communist Party, although it wouldn’t have mattered at all if the Greek left had not included any Communists. Support of the left (not to be confused with liberals of course) anywhere in the world, during and since the Cold War, has been <em>verboten</em> in US foreign policy.</p>
<p>The neo-fascists won the civil war and instituted a highly brutal regime, for which the CIA created a suitably repressive internal security agency, named and modeled after itself, the KYP. For the next 15 years, Greece was looked upon much as a piece of real estate to be developed according to Washington’s political and economic needs. One document should suffice to capture the beauty of Washington’s relationship to Athens – a 1947 letter from US Secretary of State George Marshall to Dwight Griswold, the head of the American Mission to Aid Greece, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the course of your work you and the members of your Mission will from time to time find that certain Greek officials are not, because of incompetence, disagreement with your policies, or for some other reason, extending the type of cooperation which is necessary if the objectives of your Mission are to be achieved. You will find it necessary to effect the removal of these officials. 9</p></blockquote>
<p>Where is the present-day Greek headline: “What The United States Owes Us”? Where is the <em>New York Times</em> obligation to enlighten its readers?</p>
<h3>The latest step in the evolution of America’s Police State</h3>
<p>“If you’ve got nothing to hide, you’ve got nothing to fear.”</p>
<p>So say many Americans. And many Germans as well.</p>
<p>But one German, Ilija Trojanow, would disagree. He has lent his name to published documents denouncing the National Security Agency (NSA), and was one of several prominent German authors who signed a letter to Chancellor Angela Merkel urging her to take a firm stance against the mass online surveillance conducted by the NSA. Trojanow and the other authors had nothing to hide, which is why the letter was published for the public to read. What happened after that, however, was that Trojanow was refused permission to board a flight from Salvador da Bahia, Brazil, to Miami on Monday, September 30. Without any explanation.</p>
<p>Trojanow, who was on his way to speak at a literary conference in Denver, told the <em>Spiegel</em> magazine online website that the denial of entry might be linked to his criticism of the NSA. Germany’s Foreign Ministry says it has contacted US authorities “to resolve this issue”. 10</p>
<p>In an article published in a German newspaper, Trojanow voiced his frustration with the incident: “It is more than ironic if an author who raises his voice against the dangers of surveillance and the secret state within a state for years, will be denied entry into the ‘land of the brave and the free’.”11</p>
<p>Further irony can be found in the title of a book by Trojanow: “Attack on freedom. Obsession with security, the surveillance state and the dismantling of civil rights.”</p>
<p>Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., who oversees the NSA and other intelligence agencies, said recently that the intelligence community “is only interested in communication related to valid foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes.” 12</p>
<p>It’s difficult in the extreme to see how this criterion would apply in any way to Ilija Trojanow.</p>
<p>The story is a poignant <em>caveat</em> on how fragile is Americans’ freedom to criticize their Security State. If a foreigner can be barred from boarding a flight merely for peaceful, intellectual criticism of America’s Big Brother (nay, Giant Brother), who amongst us does not need to pay careful attention to anything they say or write.</p>
<p>Very few Americans, however, will even be aware of this story. A thorough search of the Lexis-Nexis media database revealed a single mention in an American daily newspaper (The <em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em>), out of 1400 daily papers in the US. No mention on any broadcast media. A single one-time mention in a news agency (<em>Associated Press</em>), and one mention in a foreign English-language newspaper (<em>New Zealand Herald</em>).</p>

				<p>August 3, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=18340#comments" title="Comment on No Further E.U. Enlargement After Croatia"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="18340 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=18340">1 Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
			</div>
		
			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/croatiaee3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/croatiaee2.jpg" align="left" /></a>On July 1 Croatia became the 28<sup>th</sup> country to join the European Union, and on current form there will be no further enlargement for many years to come. A look at the glaring dysfunctions in Croatia’s accession, compared to the double standards Brussels imposes on Serbia and Ukraine, is indicative of the peculiar <em>mitteleuropäisch</em> view of what constitutes “Europe” which still dominates the political and media elite thinking in Berlin and Vienna.</p>
<p>After the disappointing experience with Bulgaria and Romania, which joined the EU in 2007 but continue to be plagued by unstable governments and all-pervasive corruption, many experts have expressed doubts about Croatia’s readiness for membership. On its entry a month ago it became the third-poorest nation in the EU, with unemployment hovering around 20 percent. Of those who work, one-third are employed in the public sector. If it joins the eurozone in three years, Croatia would also become a prime candidate for an eventual bailout.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/articles/2013/07/01/reportage-01">According to Transparency International</a>, Croatia is ranked below Rwanda, Namibia, Jordan or Cuba in its 1012 graft index. Former prime minister Ivo Sanader, who played a key role in negotiating the EU membership, was sentenced to ten years in jail last year for accepting multi-million bribes from foreign companies. Last March the European Commission expressed concern over Croatia’s low level of legal penalties in corruption cases and its effectiveness in battling human trafficking and organized crime. “Widespread political and economic corruption persist, and its courts often show an overly lax attitude toward due process,” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/29/opinion/global/croatia-and-the-eu.html"><i>The New York Times</i> editorialist warned</a> on June 28. “The fact is that the Union may well be about to repeat the mistakes of the last round of accessions,” he warned, thus jeopardizing Croatia’s own future, diminishing membership prospects for other Balkan states, and stalling further enlargement for the next decade or more.</p>
<p>It is no secret in Brussels that Germany wanted Croatia in for its own geopolitical reasons, however, and that was the end of the debate. There is also an economic interest. Since their products have become significantly more competitive with the elimination of the 20 percent tariff on EU goods, German manufacturers and merchants in particular stand to profit from Croatia’s entry. They cherish the prospect of over four million potential new customers who are traditionally fond of German brands.</p>
<p>Many Croatians remain deeply skeptical about the benefits of joining the Union. In last year’s referendum on EU membership, only 43 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots and exactly two-thirds voted in favor of the union—a mere 28 percent of Croatia’s electorate. Recent polls show that only 39 percent welcomed the accession. State-funded celebration in Zagreb notwithstanding, Croatian accession was marked by all-pervasive gloom among its people as well as across the EU. Some Croats fear that tough competition from the north will drive many struggling companies out of business. Even Greece, Bulgaria and Romania are in better financial shape than Croatia, according to World Bank statistics.</p>
<p>For a country facing serious demographic decline, the most serious likely consequence of EU membership will be an exodus of educated young people when work restrictions expire in two years from now. Among Croatia’s under-25s unemployment rate exceeds 50 percent. A massive brain drain has already happened to Poland after it joined the EU in 2004, and to Bulgaria and Romania after 2007.</p>
<p>Croatian Euroskeptics say that just getting ready for EU entry has crippled their country in the same manner as Brussels’ neoliberal ideology has damaged the “Club Med.” Croatia cannot join the eurozone immediately, but it is maintaining a fixed euro-kuna exchange rate to qualify for membership in three years’ time. This denies it an opportunity to devalue and make its exports and tourist industry more competitive. On current form, Croatia’s tourist infrastructure can hardly compete with that of Italy, Spain, or Greece.</p>
<p>“Croatian governments have followed obediently the EU’s austerity advice, even before the accession.” Srecko Horvat and Igor Stiks wrote <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jul/01/croatia-latest-member-eu-periphery">in an op-ed for the Guardian</a>. The country’s foreign debt now exceeds $60 billion, more than $13,000 for each of Croatia’s 4.4 million people. It now has virtually no industry and relies heavily on tourism, which accounts for 20 percent of GNP. All this, Horvat and Stiks say, means that “Croatia has not actually joined only the EU; in reality, it has become a fully fledged member of the EU periphery.” One of the EU’s longest external land borders at 800 miles, they add, will necessarily cut Croatia off from its immediate and natural surroundings and bring further isolation from its neighbors.</p>
<p>By entering the EU Croatia has lost its membership in the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), which now consists of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro and Serbia. The loss of customs privileges and trade benefits in those markets will cost the country at least 220 million dollars a year in lost exports, according to the Croatian Chamber of Commerce. Other analysts say that some 4,000 people will become unemployed as a result of Croatia losing CEFTA membership, with no compensating benefits in the highly competitive EU markets.</p>
<p>Last but not least, EU membership creates a major problem for thousands of Croats who make their living from fishing along the country’s Adriatic coast. They will face competition from much larger and better equipped fishing vessels from other EU countries—above all Italy—which are now free to operate in Croatian waters. In addition, they will have to invest heavily into new, EU-compliant trawl nets and safety equipment. Most of their gear is not in accordance with the EU’s Common Fishing Policy (CFP), whose regulations were modeled mostly on fishing in the Atlantic Ocean. Local fishers complain that successive Croatian governments did not even try to protect their interests and that they face bankruptcy.</p>
<p>For better or worse, Croatia is in the EU while other aspirants, like Serbia to the east, will stay out for many years to come—or, in the case of Ukraine, are not yet even in discussions for membership. Enlargement fatigue is all-pervasive among old and new Union members alike. The fact that it is particularly strong in Germany is what really matters. (Several smaller countries share the sentiment, notably Austria and Benelux.) German preferences largely explain the unequal treatment by Brussels of other countries in the former Yugoslavia and in Europe’s “eastern neighborhood.” What is sauce for the Croatian goose is no sauce for the Serbian or Ukrainian gander. Unlike in earlier rounds of accession, the EU no longer offers a specific timetable for achieving the promise of membership made at the summit in Thessaloniki ten years ago. Rather, the process remains <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-consequences-of-the-eu-s-enlargement-fatigue-by-john-o-brennan">open-ended and indeterminate</a>. EU Commissioner for Enlargement Štefan Füle claims that enlargement will continue, but officials in Brussels privately concede that this is not the case.</p>
<p>Last April Serbia had to sign a humiliating, EU-brokered deal with Kosovo’s secessionist government in order to obtain a “conditional” date for the opening of accession negotiations next January. Effectively giving up one-seventh of one’s sovereign territory for the sake of the elusive “Date” was both a crime and a mistake, but even that does not promise the government in Belgrade that it will be any closer to full EU membership a decade from now than it is today. Turkey has been a candidate since 1999, and yet it will never be allowed to join the EU. Skopje-Macedonia (FYROM) has had a candidate status for the past eight years, with the final goalpost nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>Even after Serbia’s capitulation last April, German lawmakers came up with a list of seven additional demands which Belgrade would need to complete in order to be given a date for the commencement of accession negotiations. They wanted the Serbian authorities “to find and prosecute the demonstrators who attacked the German embassy in Belgrade in February 2008” (a day after Berlin recognized Kosovo’s independence), which is well-nigh impossible because the German government has refused to give the Serbs any surveillance camera footage. More egregiously, the Bundestag demanded that the Serbs accept, and not deny, that “genocide” was committed in Srebrenica; to apply pressure on northern Kosovo Serbs to “actively cooperate” with EULEX and Kfor; and to display “visible readiness for legally binding normalization of relations” with Kosovo.</p>
<p>Brussels’ lack of straight dealing is equally glaring in the case of Ukraine, which is not even being offered the prospect of EU membership anytime soon. Kiev has been struggling since 2007 to obtain the more limited Association Agreement with the EU. At the 15th Ukraine-EU Summit in December 2011, the EU leaders and President Yanukovych announced that they had reached “a common understanding on the text of the Association Agreement,” and in March 2012 the chief negotiators of the European Union and Ukraine initialed the text of the Agreement. Stefan Füle announced at that time that the Agreement could be finally signed after the Ukrainian general election in October 2012. It did not happen. Additional demands and conditions keep emerging instead.</p>
<p>Topping the list is the case of Yulia Tymoshenko, a former prime minister, who is serving a seven-year jail sentence for corruption and is facing murder charges for the 1996 killing of a political opponent. Even though the case against the richest woman in Ukraine seems strong, Brussels has taken the position that it was politically motivated. The EU has also criticized Ukrainian authorities for failing to conduct last October’s parliamentary elections “in line with international democratic standards.”  With Germany again the lead skeptical voice on the EU side, the question of whether the Association Agreement will be signed at the Vilnius summit this November remains uncertain. If it is not signed, it will not be for lack of trying from the Ukrainian side.</p>
<p>Unequal treatment of different countries by the EU’s old core—and above all by Germany—reflects some old prejudices and cultural preferences which will not go away. Of course, no German politician will ever admit that his or her judgment is impacted by the fact that the Croats were German allies in both world wars, while the Serbs or Ukrainians were no</p>

<p>While I was listening to a recent interview with Graham Hancock about his<a href="http://www.grahamhancock.com/wargod/synopsis.php" target="_blank"> new novel</a> and his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0c5nIvJH7w" target="_blank">TED lecture</a>, the startling claim was made that Russian President Vladimir Putin commented that war might be a necessary result of the Monsanto Protection Act.</p>
<p>I was skeptical, but did a little digging around, and it turns out the story checks out…</p>
<p>The shocking minutes relating to President Putin’s meeting last month with US Secretary of State John Kerry reveal the Russian leaders “extreme outrage” over the Obama regimes continued protection of global seed and plant bio-genetic giants Syngenta and Monsanto in the face of a growing “bee apocalypse” that the Kremlin warns “will most certainly” lead to world war.</p>
<p>According to these minutes, released in the Kremlin today by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation (<a href="http://www.mnr.gov.ru/english/" target="_blank">MNRE</a>), Putin was so incensed over the Obama regimes refusal to discuss this grave matter that he <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2321001/Vladimir-Putin-keeps-John-Kerry-waiting-THREE-HOURS-visit-Russia-Syria-talks.html" target="_blank">refused for three hours</a> to even meet with Kerry, who had traveled to Moscow on a scheduled diplomatic mission, but then relented so as to not cause an even greater rift between these two nations.</p>
<p>At the center of this dispute between Russia and the US, this MNRE report says, is the “undisputed evidence” that a class of neuro-active insecticides chemically related to nicotine, known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonicotinoid" target="_blank">neonicotinoids</a>, are destroying our planets bee population, and which if left unchecked could destroy our world’s ability to grow enough food to feed its population.</p>
<p>So grave has this situation become, the MNRE reports, the full European Commission (EC) this past week instituted a two-year precautionary ban (<a href="http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1112840296/eu-bee-protection-pesticide-ban-nenicotinoid-clothianidin-imidacloprid-thiametoxam-050713/" target="_blank">set to begin on 1 December 2013</a>) on these <a href="http://worldradio.ch/wrs/news/switzerland/switzerland-puts-in-place-partial-ban-of-bee-killi.shtml?35568" target="_blank">“bee killing” pesticides</a> following the lead of Switzerland, France, Italy, Russia, Slovenia and Ukraine, all of whom had previously banned these most dangerous of genetically altered organisms from being used on the continent.</p>
<p>Two of the most feared neonicotinoids being banned are <a href="http://www.syngenta.com/global/corporate/en/products-and-innovation/product-brands/crop-protection/insecticides/Pages/actara.aspx" target="_blank">Actara</a> and <a href="http://www.syngenta.com/global/corporate/en/products-and-innovation/product-brands/seed-care/Pages/cruiser.aspx" target="_blank">Cruiser</a> made by the Swiss global bio-tech seed and pesticide giant <a href="http://www.syngenta.com/global/corporate/en/Pages/home.aspx" target="_blank">Syngenta AG</a> which employs over 26,000 people in over 90 countries and ranks third in total global sales in the commercial agricultural seeds market.</p>
<p>Important to note, this report says, is that Syngenta, along with bio-tech giants Monsanto, Bayer, Dow and DuPont, now <a href="http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_round_up/625294/revealed_how_seed_market_is_controlled_by_monsanto_syngenta_bayer_dow_dupont.html" target="_blank">control nearly 100%</a> of the global market for genetically modified pesticides, plants and seeds.</p>
<p>Also to note about Syngenta, this report continues, is that in 2012 it was <a href="http://www.infowars.com/busted-biotech-leader-syngenta-charged-over-covering-up-animal-deaths-from-gm-corn/" target="_blank">criminally charged in Germany</a> for concealing the fact that its genetically modified corn killed cattle, and <a href="http://www.infowars.com/bilderbergs-syngenta-settles-after-contaminating-u-s-water-supply/" target="_blank">settled a class-action lawsuit in the US for $105 million</a> after it was discovered they had contaminated the drinking supply of some 52 million Americans in more than 2,000 water districts with its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrazine#Health_and_environmental_effects" target="_blank">“gender-bending” herbicide Atrazine</a>.</p>
<p>To how staggeringly frightful this situation is, the MNRE says, can be seen in the report issued this past March by the American Bird Conservancy (<a href="http://www.abcbirds.org/" target="_blank">ABC</a>) wherein they <a href="http://www.fooddemocracynow.org/blog/2013/mar/20/new_report_shows_neonicotinoids_kill_birds_bees/" target="_blank">warned our whole planet is in danger, and as we can, in part, read</a>:</p>
<p>“As part of a study on impacts from the world’s most widely used class of insecticides, nicotine-like chemicals called neonicotinoids, American Bird Conservancy (ABC) has called for a ban on their use as seed treatments and for the suspension of all applications pending an independent review of the products’ effects on birds, terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates, and other wildlife.</p>

</div>
<p>“It is clear that these chemicals have the potential to affect entire food chains. The environmental persistence of the neonicotinoids, their propensity for runoff and for groundwater infiltration, and their cumulative and largely irreversible mode of action in invertebrates raise significant environmental concerns,” said Cynthia Palmer, co-author of the report and Pesticides Program Manager for ABC, one of the nation’s leading bird conservation organizations.</p>
<p>ABC commissioned world renowned environmental toxicologist Dr. Pierre Mineau to conduct the research. The 100-page report, “The Impact of the Nation’s Most Widely Used Insecticides on Birds,” reviews 200 studies on neonicotinoids including industry research obtained through the US Freedom of Information Act. The report evaluates the toxicological risk to birds and aquatic systems and includes extensive comparisons with the older pesticides that the neonicotinoids have replaced. The assessment concludes that the neonicotinoids are lethal to birds and to the aquatic systems on which they depend.</p>
<p>“A single corn kernel coated with a neonicotinoid can kill a songbird,” Palmer said. “Even a tiny grain of wheat or canola treated with the oldest neonicotinoid — called imidacloprid — can fatally poison a bird. And as little as 1/10th of a neonicotinoid-coated corn seed per day during egg-laying season is all that is needed to affect reproduction.”</p>
<p>The new report concludes that neonicotinoid contamination levels in both surface- and ground water in the United States and around the world are already beyond the threshold found to kill many aquatic invertebrates.”</p>

<img alt="baz4" src="http://politicalblindspot.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/baz4.jpg" width="490" height="300" data-cfsrc="http://politicalblindspot.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/baz4.jpg" data-cfloaded="true" /></p>
</div>
<p>Quickly following this damning report, the MRNE says, a large group of group of American beekeepers and environmentalists sued the Obama regime over the continued use of these neonicotinoids stating: <a href="http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/03/20/epa-sued-over-ongoing-bee-losses" target="_blank">“We are taking the EPA to court for its failure to protect bees from pesticides. Despite our best efforts to warn the agency about the problems posed by neonicotinoids, the EPA continued to ignore the clear warning signs of an agricultural system in trouble.”</a></p>
<p>And to how bad the world’s agricultural system has really become due to these genetically modified plants, pesticides and seeds, this report continues, can be seen by the EC’s proposal this past week, following their ban on neonicotinoids, in which they plan to criminalize nearly all seeds and plants not registered with the European Union, and <a href="http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/23270/53/" target="_blank">as we can, in part, read</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Europe is rushing towards the good ol days circa 1939, 40… A new law proposed by the European Commission would make it illegal to “grow, reproduce or trade” any vegetable seeds that have not been “tested, approved and accepted” by a new EU bureaucracy named the “EU Plant Variety Agency.”</p>
<p>It’s called the Plant Reproductive Material Law, and it attempts to put the government in charge of virtually all plants and seeds. Home gardeners who grow their own plants from non-regulated seeds would be considered criminals under this law.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This MRNE report points out that even though this EC action may appear draconian, it is nevertheless necessary in order to purge the continent from continued contamination of these genetically bred “seed monstrosities.”</p>
<p>Most perplexing in all of this, the MRNE says, and which led to Putin’s anger at the US, has been the Obama regimes efforts to <a href="http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jsass/the_scientific_evidence_agains.html" target="_blank">protect pesticide-producer profits</a> over the catastrophic damaging being done to the environment, and as the Guardian News Service detailed in their 2 May article titled “<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/may/02/us-bee-report-pesticide-eu" target="_blank">US rejects EU claim of insecticide as prime reason for bee colony collapse</a>” and which, in part, says:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/may/02/us-bee-report-pesticide-eu" target="_blank">“The European Union voted this week for a two-year ban on a class of pesticides, known as neonicotinoids, that has been associated with the bees’ collapse. The US government report, in contrast, found multiple causes for the collapse of the honeybees.”</a></p>
<p>To the “truer” reason for the Obama regimes protection of these bio-tech giants destroying our world, the MRNE says, can be viewed in the report titled “<a href="http://www.infowars.com/how-did-barack-obama-become-monsantos-man-in-washington/" target="_blank">How did Barack Obama become Monsanto’s man in Washington?</a>” and which, in part, says:</p>
<blockquote><p>“After his victory in the 2008 election, Obama filled key posts with Monsanto people, in federal agencies that wield tremendous force in food issues, the USDA and the FDA: At the USDA, as the director of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Roger Beachy, former director of the Monsanto Danforth Center. As deputy commissioner of the FDA, the new food-safety-issues czar, the infamous Michael Taylor, former vice-president for public policy for Monsanto. Taylor had been instrumental in getting approval for Monsanto’s genetically engineered bovine growth hormone.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Even worse, after Russia <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2208452/Russia-suspends-import-use-American-GM-corn-study-revealed-cancer-risk.html" target="_blank">suspended the import and use of an Monsanto genetically modified corn</a> following a study suggesting a link to breast cancer and organ damage this past September, the <a href="http://rt.com/usa/monsanto-congress-silently-slips-830/" target="_blank">Russia Today News Service reported on the Obama regimes response</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The US House of Representatives quietly passed a last-minute addition to the Agricultural Appropriations Bill for 2013 last week – including a provision protecting genetically modified seeds from litigation in the face of health risks.</p>
<p>The rider, which is officially known as the Farmer Assurance Provision, has been derided by opponents of biotech lobbying as the “Monsanto Protection Act,” as it would strip federal courts of the authority to immediately halt the planting and sale of genetically modified (GMO) seed crop regardless of any consumer health concerns.</p>
<p>The provision, also decried as a “biotech rider,” should have gone through the Agricultural or Judiciary Committees for review. Instead, no hearings were held, and the piece was evidently unknown to most Democrats (who hold the majority in the Senate) prior to its approval as part of HR 993, the short-term funding bill that was approved to avoid a federal government shutdown.”</p></blockquote>
<p>On 26 March, Obama <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/03/31/obama-signs-order-that-protects-maker-of-genetically-modified-crops/" target="_blank">quietly signed this “Monsanto Protection Act” into law</a> thus ensuring the American people have no recourse against this bio-tech giant as they fall ill by the tens of millions, and many millions will surely end up dying in what this MRNE report calls the greatest agricultural apocalypse in human history as <a href="http://blog.targethealth.com/?p=58" target="_blank">over 90% of feral (wild) bee population in the US has already died out, and up to 80% of domestic bees have died out too</a>.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/serbian-stance3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/serbian-stance2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>Over the past two decades the decisionmakers in Washington have acquired and internalized a bias in Balkan affairs that falls outside the parameters of rational debate. As Doug Bandow of the Cato Institute has noted, such policy is not as inconsistent as it seems: “Time after time the U.S. policy makers would ask what is it that the Serbs want, they would think about it for about five seconds, and reply that it is totally unacceptable.”</p>
<p>Such consistency has had grim results. Their mendacity, as displayed at Rambouillet in February 1999, was on par with the farce of Munich in 1938. In Kosovo their bombs led to a violent secession by an ethnic minority which, in the fullness of time, may render many European borders tentative. In Bosnia-Herzegovina they helped ignite the war in the spring of 1992, notably with U.S. Ambassador Warren Zimmermann’s now notorious mission to Sarajevo. They kept it going in 1993 by torpedoing the European-led peace initiatives. They engineered an outcome in 1995 that could have been obtained in 1992 without a single shot. In Croatia, in August 1995, they aided and abetted the biggest act of ethnic cleansing in post-1945 Europe.</p>
<p>The puzzling question remains: why did America get involved in Balkan affairs, which bear no relationship to U.S. security, involving herself in long-standing and perhaps incurable national conflicts, and consistently acting in bad faith at that?</p>
<p>THE BURDEN OF HISTORY—The U.S. policy in the Balkans made its debut near the end of the First World War. President Wilson, while advocating the creation of Yugoslavia in 1918, did not realize that the unification of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was at least half-century overdue: the process of separate cultural development and the emergence of mutually incompatible national identities among the South Slavs had been completed. But being a liberal, Wilson did not allow Balkan realities to get in the way of his vision. He blended the Puritan self-righteous zeal with the Progressive Era’s belief in the power of politics to change the world for the better. His concepts of “self-determination,” “enlarging democracy” and “collective security” signaled the birth of a view of America’s role in world affairs which has created—and is still creating—endless problems for America and for the world.</p>
<p>After 1948 Tito came to be perceived as an asset by the U.S. Money, weapons, and warm welcome were soon to follow and continued until the end of the dictator’s life in 1980. Fixated on “Tito’s Yugoslavia” as a factor of Cold War stability, key American leaders disregarded—a decade later—the fact that Tito’s internal boundaries between the federal republics were the root cause of the looming conflict. Arbitrarily designed by the communist winners in the civil war in 1945, they left a third of all Serbs outside Serbia-proper, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Montenegro. For good measure two “autonomous provinces” were carved out of Serbia, one of which—Kosovo—is an almost <em>Serbenfrei</em> quasi-state today.</p>
<p>For as long as Yugoslavia existed the Serbs could nevertheless derive some comfort from the existence of a common Federal framework: it appeared to promise them a measure of security from the repetition of the nightmare of 1941-45. When Yugoslavia started unraveling, however, in 1991-92, they were determined to resist any attempt by the breakaway republics to force millions of Serbs to become insecure and disliked minorities in their own land.</p>
<p>POLITICAL ESSENCE OF THE WARS—In Croatia in 1991 and in Bosnia in 1992 the Serbs reacted in the same manner as the Americans of Texas, Arizona or New Mexico may react—10 or 20 years from now—if they are outvoted by a Latino majority demanding that those states be reabsorbed into Mexico, or into a contrived “Republic of the North.” For those who discount such outcomes, let us remember history. For example, the Protestant Ulstermen fought, demanded, and were given the right to stay in the United Kingdom when the Irish nationalists opted for secession in 1921. A second poignant illustration is the creation of the State of West Virginia in 1863 when—during the Civil War—the Union annexed the counties of the Commonwealth of Virginia that rejected secession. When comparing the paradigms, the Loyalists of Ulster and the Unionists of West Virginia were just as guilty of a “Joint Criminal Enterprise” to break up Ireland, or the Old Dominion, as were the Serbs of Bosnia-Herzegovina who did not want to be dragged into secession by the Muslim plurality.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia was a flawed polity, and in principle there should have been no objection to the striving of Croats or Bosnian Muslims to create their own nation-states. But equally there could have been no justification for forcing over two million Serbs west of the Drina River to be incorporated into those states against their will. Yugoslavia came together in 1918 as a union of South Slav <em>peoples</em>, and not as a federation of states or territorial units. Its divorce, once it became inevitable, should have proceeded on the same basis. This has been the key foundation of the Yugoslav conflict ever since the first shots were fired in May 1991.</p>
<p>The political essence of the wars of Yugoslav disintegration has been systematically hidden or distorted in the Western mainstream media, academia, and political forums, behind the portrayal of the Serbs as primitive ultranationalists who seek to conquer other peoples’ lands by violent means. The demonization of the Serbs was an exercise in social constructivism, depressingly effective in its crude simplicity. As early as 1992 the media pack equated the brutalities of the Balkans with the Holocaust. Once the paradigm matured with the myth of the “Srebrenica Genocide,” and once any doubters were equated with holocaust deniers, the possibilities for mendacity were limitless. Its fruits will be with us for decades to come.</p>
<p>UNDERSTANDING THE ABSURD—At the level of institutionalized corruption which passes for the political process in Washington D.C. the Yugoslav policy was the end-result of the interaction of pressure groups within the power structure: finding a new role for NATO, earning points in the Muslim world, caving in to ethnic lobbying, pandering to the military-industrial complex, isolating Russia, controlling strategic routes between Europe and the Middle East, and above all cementing American global hegemony. The influence of organized political lobbies in Washington was not decisive, but it should not be underestimated. Anti-Serb lobbies, notably Albanian-Americans, have been well-funded and well-placed for decades, while today (as in the past) the “Serbian lobby” does not exist. As James Jatras has noted, well before the outbreak of hostilities in 1991, the Serbs had already been branded the bad guys. Combined with media reinforcement, much false information was and still is accepted as unquestionable fact.</p>
<p>The Bosnian war transformed NATO into a tool of U.S. hegemony and it opened the door to the renewal of American dominance in European affairs to an extent not seen since Kennedy. As the late Richard Holbrooke put it, Dayton demonstrated that Europeans were not capable of resolving their own problems and that America was still the “indispensable nation.” He boasted, a year later, “We are re-engaged in the world, and Bosnia was the test.”</p>
<p>It is undeniable that geopolitical-strategic factors have played a role in defining the Balkan policy in Washington. Such “rational” reasons are not sufficient, however, to explain the zeal of successive administrations in pursuing a premeditatedly duplicitous anti-Serb policy. The clue is not in the realm of tangible strategic benefits and geopolitical assets, of transit corridors, oil and gas pipelines, lignite and zinc reserves, or military bases such as Camp Bondsteel. The key is in the desire of the Western elite class to use the Balkans as a testing ground for their emerging postmodernist, postnational project. They know that Kosovo is more than a piece of real estate, that it is to the Serbs what Alamo is to Texans or Jerusalem to Jews, that taking it away and letting its churches and monasteries be demolished is an unprecedented exercise in ethnocide. They condoned the Albanian barbarity because they saw the demolition of a small nation steeped in tradition of heroism and martyrdom—the Kosovo saga embodies it perfectly—as a step in the direction of a U.S.-dominated post-national world based on propositional abstractions.</p>
<p>This is the cue to the treatment of the Serbs by the U.S. political and media decision-makers over the past two decades. On the ruins of real nations, the rhetoric of “universal human rights” is imposed as the new basis for law and morality. The Serbs were merely a litmus test. The slogan of choice is <em>multicultural democracy</em>, irrespective of the wishes of the citizens of the particular territory involved—unless it is Serbs who wish to maintain a multi-ethnic state, in which case secession is the West’s preferred policy.</p>
<p>PANDERING TO ISLAMIC MILITANTS—In 1980 the U.S. supported hard-core Islamists in the insurgency against the Soviets in Afghanistan. That decision was a strategic mistake of the highest order: it prompted the release of the Jihadist genie from a bottle that had remained sealed for almost three centuries after the siege of Vienna. Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski’s “brilliant idea”—as he called the Afghan covert action almost two decades after the event—meant that hundreds of millions, and eventually billions of dollars were poured into the coffers and arsenals of people who openly stated their intention to rebuild an early-medieval theocracy in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The fruits went beyond the jihadists’ wildest dreams. Brzezinski will go down in history as the man who did for Bin Laden what the Kaiser did for Lenin by providing him with that sealed train in 1917. Two “liberal” interventions on the side of the Balkan Muslims, in Bosnia and Kosovo, ensued in the 1990s. The most tangible result of promoting “common ideals and interests in this globalized world” by NATO bombs is the existence of a vibrant, hard-core jihadist base in the heart of Europe that has had a connection with every major terrorist attack in the past decade. Even 9/11 itself had a Bosnian Connection: Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, who planned the 9/11 attacks, was a seasoned veteran of the Bosnian jihad, as were two of the hijackers.</p>
<p>In spite of all other unresolved domestic and foreign issues, at a time when the U.S. power and authority are challenged around the world, key players in President Obama’s team still look upon the Balkans as the last geopolitically significant area where they can assert their “credibility” by postulating a maximalist set of objectives as the only outcome acceptable to the United States, and duly insisting on their fulfillment. We have already seen this pattern with Kosovo, and we’ve seen an attempt to stage its replay in Bosnia under the ongoing demand for unitarization.</p>
<p>The U.S. policy in the Balkans—just like its policy in Libya last year and in Syria today –facilitates the jihadist agenda. American goals paradoxically coincide with the regional objectives of those same Islamists who confront America in other parts of the world. Far from enhancing peace and regional stability, such policies continue to encourage pan-Islamic agitation for the completion of an uninterrupted Green Corridor in the Balkans by linking its as yet unconnected segments. It destabilizes Bosnia by encouraging constant Muslim demands for the abolition of the Republika Srpska, and it destabilizes Serbia in the Raska region (“Sanjak”). It encourages greater-Albanian aspirations against Macedonia, Montenegro, Greece, and Serbia. It encourages escalation of Turkey’s neo-Ottoman ambitions in the region. It is destructive and harmful.</p>
<p>In all cases the immediate bill will be paid by the people of the Balkans, as it is already being paid by Kosovo’s disappearing Serbs; but long-term costs of the U.S. policy in the Balkans will haunt the West. By encouraging its Albanian clients to proclaim independence, the U.S. administration has made a massive leap into the unknown, potentially on par with Austria’s July 1914 ultimatum to Serbia. The fruits will be equally bitter. In the fullness of time both America and Europe will come to regret the criminal folly of their current leaders. Remarkably, the continuing automatic-pilot policy directed against the Serbs is taking place without any serious debate in Washington on the ends and uses of American power, in the Balkans or anywhere else. Obama’s and Bush’s rhetoric differ, but they are one regime, identical in substance and consequence. Its leading lights will go on disputing the validity of the emerging balance-of-power system because they reject the legitimacy of any power in the world other than that of the United States, controlled and exercised by themselves. Theirs is, indeed, the global equivalent of the Brezhnev Doctrine.</p>
<p>The quest for hegemony leads to a counter-coalition which defeats it. The proponents of American exceptionalism nevertheless scoff at history’s warnings provided by Napoleon’s defeat in 1815, the Kaiser’s in 1918, or Hitler’s in 1945, as inapplicable in the post-history that they seek to construct. They confront the argument that no vital American interest worthy of risking a major war is involved in Georgia, or Syria, or the Balkans, with the claim that the whole world is America’s near-abroad. It is therefore essential for the emerging powers to refuse <em>in principle</em> to accept the validity of Washington’s ideological assumptions and the legitimacy of its associated geopolitical claims. At the same time, the key “liberal hawks” in the Obama Administration remain anchored in Madeleine Albright’s hubris: “If we have to use force, it is because we are America. We are the indispensable nation. We stand tall.”</p>
<p>The premises of an imperial presidency—which in world affairs translates into the quest for dominance and justification for interventionism—remain unchallenged, as we are witnessing in Syria today and as we shall witness in Iran tomorrow. (We are witnessing it in America, too, with Obama’s unrestrained use of the Presidential executive order—an extreme emergency measure—as a tool for overriding the will of the Legislative branch.) American meddling in the Balkans has been paradigmatic of the problem. It remains unaffected by the ongoing financial crisis manifest in a 16-trillion public debt, just as Moscow’s late-Cold War adventurism—so tragically manifested in Afghanistan—was enhanced, rather than curtailed, by the evident shortcomings of the Soviet political and economic system.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/manning-wikileaks-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/manning-wikileaks-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a><em>&#8220;Defense lawyers say Manning was clearly a troubled young soldier whom the Army should never have deployed to Iraq or given access to classified material while he was stationed there &#8230; They say he was in emotional turmoil, partly because he was a gay soldier at a time when homosexuals were barred from serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.&#8221; </em>(Associated Press, February 3)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate and disturbing that Bradley Manning&#8217;s attorneys have chosen to consistently base his legal defense upon the premise that personal problems and shortcomings are what motivated the young man to turn over hundreds of thousands of classified government files to Wikileaks. They should not be presenting him that way any more than Bradley should be tried as a criminal or traitor. He should be hailed as a national hero. Yes, even when the lawyers are talking to the military mind. May as well try to penetrate that mind and find the freest and best person living there. Bradley also wears a military uniform.</p>
<p>Here are Manning&#8217;s own words from an online chat: &#8220;If you had free reign over classified networks &#8230; and you saw incredible things, awful things &#8230; things that belonged in the public domain, and not on some server stored in a dark room in Washington DC &#8230; what would you do? &#8230; God knows what happens now. Hopefully worldwide discussion, debates, and reforms. &#8230; I want people to see the truth &#8230; because without information, you cannot make informed decisions as a public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is the world to believe that these are the words of a disturbed and irrational person? Do not the Nuremberg Tribunal and the Geneva Conventions speak of a higher duty than blind loyalty to one&#8217;s government, a duty to report the war crimes of that government?</p>
<p>Below is a listing of some of the things revealed in the State Department cables and Defense Department files and videos. For exposing such embarrassing and less-than-honorable behavior, Bradley Manning of the United States Army and Julian Assange of Wikileaks may spend most of their remaining days in a modern dungeon, much of it while undergoing that particular form of torture known as &#8220;solitary confinement&#8221;. Indeed, it has been suggested that the mistreatment of Manning has been for the purpose of making him testify against and implicating Assange. Dozens of members of the American media and public officials have called for Julian Assange&#8217;s execution or assassination. Under the new National Defense Authorization Act, Assange could well be kidnaped or assassinated. What century are we living in? What world?</p>
<p>It was after seeing American war crimes such as those depicted in the video &#8220;Collateral Murder&#8221; and documented in the &#8220;Iraq War Logs,&#8221; made public by Manning and Wikileaks, that the Iraqis refused to exempt US forces from prosecution for future crimes. The video depicts an American helicopter indiscriminately murdering several non-combatants in addition to two Reuters journalists, and the wounding of two little children, while the helicopter pilots cheer the attacks in a Baghdad suburb like it was the Army-Navy game in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The insistence of the Iraqi government on legal jurisdiction over American soldiers for violations of Iraqi law — something the United States rarely, if ever, accepts in any of the many countries where its military is stationed — forced the Obama administration to pull the remaining American troops from the country.</p>
<p>If Manning had committed war crimes in Iraq instead of exposing them, he would be a free man today, as are the many hundreds/thousands of American soldiers guilty of truly loathsome crimes in cities like Haditha, Fallujah, and other places whose names will live in infamy in the land of ancient Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>Besides playing a role in writing finis to the awful Iraq war, the Wikileaks disclosures helped to spark the Arab Spring, beginning in Tunisia.</p>
<p>When people in Tunisia read or heard of US Embassy cables revealing the extensive corruption and decadence of the extended ruling family there — one long and detailed cable being titled: &#8220;CORRUPTION IN TUNISIA: WHAT&#8217;S YOURS IS MINE&#8221; — how Washington&#8217;s support of Tunisian President Ben Ali was not really strong, and that the US would not support the regime in the event of a popular uprising, they took to the streets.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of some of the other Wikileaks revelations that make the people of the world wiser:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2009 Japanese diplomat Yukiya Amano became the new head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which plays the leading role in the investigation of whether Iran is developing nuclear weapons or is working only on peaceful civilian nuclear energy projects. A US embassy cable of October 2009 said Amano &#8220;took pains to emphasize his support for U.S. strategic objectives for the Agency. Amano reminded the [American] ambassador on several occasions that &#8230; he was solidly in the U.S. court on every key strategic decision, from high-level personnel appointments to the handling of Iran&#8217;s alleged nuclear weapons program.&#8221;</li>
<li>Russia refuted US claims that Iran has missiles that could target Europe.</li>
<li>The British government&#8217;s official inquiry into how it got involved in the Iraq War was deeply compromised by the government&#8217;s pledge to protect the Bush administration in the course of the inquiry.</li>
<li>A discussion between Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and American Gen. David H. Petraeus in which Saleh indicated he would cover up the US role in missile strikes against al-Qaeda&#8217;s affiliate in Yemen. &#8220;We&#8217;ll continue saying the bombs are ours, not yours,&#8221; Saleh told Petraeus.</li>
<li>The US embassy in Madrid has had serious points of friction with the Spanish government and civil society: a) trying to get the criminal case dropped against three US soldiers accused of killing a Spanish television cameraman in Baghdad during a 2003 unprovoked US tank shelling of the hotel where he and other journalists were staying; b )torture cases brought by a Spanish NGO against six senior Bush administration officials, including former attorney general Alberto Gonzales; c) a Spanish government investigation into the torture of Spanish subjects held at Guantánamo; d) a probe by a Spanish court into the use of Spanish bases and airfields for American extraordinary rendition (= torture) flights; e )continual criticism of the Iraq war by Spanish Prime Minister Zapatero, who eventually withdrew Spanish troops.</li>
<li>State Department officials at the United Nations, as well as US diplomats in various embassies, were assigned to gather as much of the following information as possible about UN officials, including Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, permanent security council representatives, senior UN staff, and foreign diplomats: e-mail and website addresses, internet user names and passwords, personal encryption keys, credit card numbers, frequent flyer account numbers, work schedules, and biometric data. US diplomats at the embassy in Asunción, Paraguay were asked to obtain dates, times and telephone numbers of calls received and placed by foreign diplomats from China, Iran and the Latin American leftist states of Cuba, Venezuela and Bolivia. US diplomats in Romania, Hungary and Slovenia were instructed to provide biometric information on &#8220;current and emerging leaders and advisers&#8221; as well as information about &#8220;corruption&#8221; and information about leaders&#8217; health and &#8220;vulnerability&#8221;. The UN directive also specifically asked for &#8220;biometric information on ranking North Korean diplomats&#8221;. A similar cable to embassies in the Great Lakes region of Africa said biometric data included DNA, as well as iris scans and fingerprints.</li>
<li>A special &#8220;Iran observer&#8221; in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku reported on a dispute that played out during a meeting of Iran&#8217;s Supreme National Security Council. An enraged Revolutionary Guard Chief of Staff, Mohammed Ali Jafari, allegedly got into a heated argument with Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and slapped him in the face because the generally conservative president had, surprisingly, advocated freedom of the press.</li>
<li>The State Department, virtually alone in the Western Hemisphere, did not unequivocally condemn a June 28, 2009 military coup in Honduras, even though an embassy cable declared: &#8220;there is no doubt that the military, Supreme Court and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch&#8221;. US support of the coup government has been unwavering ever since.</li>
<li>The leadership of the Swedish Social Democratic Party — neutral, pacifist, and liberal Sweden, so the long-standing myth goes — visited the US embassy in Stockholm and asked for advice on how best to sell the war in Afghanistan to a skeptical Swedish public, asking if the US could arrange for a member of the Afghan government to come visit Sweden and talk up NATO&#8217;s humanitarian efforts on behalf of Afghan children, and so forth. [For some years now Sweden has been, in all but name, a member of NATO and the persecutor of Julian Assange, the latter to please a certain Western power.]</li>
<li>The US pushed to influence Swedish wiretapping laws so communication passing through the Scandinavian country could be intercepted. The American interest was clear: Eighty per cent of all the internet traffic from Russia travels through Sweden.</li>
<li>President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy told US embassy officials in Brussels in January 2010 that no one in Europe believed in Afghanistan anymore. He said Europe was going along in deference to the United States and that there must be results in 2010, or &#8220;Afghanistan is over for Europe.&#8221;</li>
<li>Iraqi officials saw Saudi Arabia, not Iran, as the biggest threat to the integrity and cohesion of their fledgling democratic state. The Iraqi leaders were keen to assure their American patrons that they could easily &#8220;manage&#8221; the Iranians, who wanted stability; but that the Saudis wanted a &#8220;weak and fractured&#8221; Iraq, and were even &#8220;fomenting terrorism that would destabilize the government&#8221;. The Saudi King, moreover, wanted a US military strike on Iran.</li>
<li>Saudi Arabia in 2007 threatened to pull out of a Texas oil refinery investment unless the US government intervened to stop Saudi Aramco from being sued in US courts for alleged oil price fixing. The deputy Saudi oil minister said that he wanted the US to grant Saudi Arabia sovereign immunity from lawsuits</li>
<li>Saudi donors were the chief financiers of Sunni militant groups like Al Qaeda, the Afghan Taliban, and Lashkar-e-Taiba, which carried out the 2008 Mumbai attacks.</li>
<li>Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest pharmaceutical company, hired investigators to unearth evidence of corruption against the Nigerian attorney general in order to persuade him to drop legal action over a controversial 1996 drug trial involving children with meningitis.</li>
<li>Oil giant Shell claimed to have &#8220;inserted staff&#8221; and fully infiltrated Nigeria&#8217;s government.</li>
<li>The Obama administration renewed military ties with Indonesia in spite of serious concerns expressed by American diplomats about the Indonesian military&#8217;s activities in the province of West Papua, expressing fears that the Indonesian government&#8217;s neglect, rampant corruption and human rights abuses were stoking unrest in the region.</li>
<li>US officials collaborated with Lebanon&#8217;s defense minister to spy on, and allow Israel to potentially attack, Hezbollah in the weeks that preceded a violent May 2008 military confrontation in Beirut.</li>
<li>Gabon president Omar Bongo allegedly pocketed millions in embezzled funds from central African states, channeling some of it to French political parties in support of Nicolas Sarkozy.</li>
<li>Cables from the US embassy in Caracas in 2006 asked the US Secretary of State to warn President Hugo Chávez against a Venezuelan military intervention to defend the Cuban revolution in the eventuality of an American invasion after Castro&#8217;s death.</li>
<li>The United States was concerned that the leftist Latin American television network, Telesur, headquartered in Venezuela, would collaborate with al Jazeera of Qatar, whose coverage of the Iraq War had gotten under the skin of the Bush administration.</li>
<li>The Vatican told the United States it wanted to undermine the influence of Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez in Latin America because of concerns about the deterioration of Catholic power there. It feared that Chávez was seriously damaging relations between the Catholic church and the state by identifying the church hierarchy in Venezuela as part of the privileged class.</li>
<li>The Holy See welcomed President Obama&#8217;s new outreach to Cuba and hoped for further steps soon, perhaps to include prison visits for the wives of the Cuban Five. Better US-Cuba ties would deprive Hugo Chávez of one of his favorite screeds and could help restrain him in the region.</li>
<li>The wonderful world of diplomats: In 2010, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown raised with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the question of visas for two wives of members of the &#8220;Cuban Five&#8221;. &#8220;Brown requested that the wives (who have previously been refused visas to visit the U.S.) be granted visas so that they could visit their husbands in prison. &#8230; Our subsequent queries to Number 10 indicate that Brown made this request as a result of a commitment that he had made to UK trade unionists, who form part of the Labour Party&#8217;s core constituency. Now that the request has been made, Brown does not intend to pursue this matter further. There is no USG action required.&#8221;</li>
<li>UK Officials concealed from Parliament how the US was allowed to bring cluster bombs onto British soil in defiance of a treaty banning the housing of such weapons.</li>
<li>A cable was sent by an official at the US Interests Section in Havana in July 2006, during the runup to the Non-Aligned Movement conference. He noted that he was actively looking for &#8220;human interest stories and other news that shatters the myth of Cuban medical prowess&#8221;. [Presumably to be used to weaken support for Cuba amongst the member nations at the conference.]</li>
<li>Most of the men sent to Guantánamo prison were innocent people or low-level operatives; many of the innocent individuals were sold to the US for bounty.</li>
<li>DynCorp, a powerful American defense contracting firm that claims almost $2 billion per year in revenue from US tax dollars, threw a &#8220;boy-play&#8221; party for Afghan police recruits. (Yes, it&#8217;s what you think.)</li>
<li>Even though the Bush and Obama Administrations repeatedly maintained publicly that there was no official count of civilian casualties, the Iraq and Afghanistan War Logs showed that this claim was untrue.</li>
<li>Known Egyptian torturers received training at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia.</li>
<li>The United States put great pressure on the Haitian government to not go ahead with various projects, with no regard for the welfare of the Haitian people. A 2005 cable stressed continued US insistence that all efforts must be made to keep former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whom the United States had overthrown the previous year, from returning to Haiti or influencing the political process. In 2006, Washington&#8217;s target was President René Préval for his agreeing to a deal with Venezuela to join Caracas&#8217;s Caribbean oil alliance, PetroCaribe, under which Haiti would buy oil from Venezuela, paying only 60 percent up front with the remainder payable over twenty-five years at 1 percent interest. And in 2009, the State Department backed American corporate opposition to an increase in the minimum wage for Haitian workers, the poorest paid in the Western Hemisphere.</li>
<li>The United States used threats, spying, and more to try to get its way at the crucial 2009 climate conference in Copenhagen.</li>
<li>Mahmoud Abbas, president of The Palestinian National Authority, and head of the Fatah movement, turned to Israel for help in attacking Hamas in Gaza in 2007.</li>
<li>The British government trained a Bangladeshi paramilitary force condemned by human rights organisations as a &#8220;government death squad&#8221;.</li>
<li>A US military order directed American forces not to investigate cases of torture of detainees by Iraqis.</li>
<li>The US was involved in the Australian government&#8217;s 2006 campaign to oust Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare.</li>
<li>A 2009 US cable said that police brutality in Egypt against common criminals was routine and pervasive, the police using force to extract confessions from criminals on a daily basis.</li>
<li>US diplomats pressured the German government to stifle the prosecution of CIA operatives who abducted and tortured Khalid El-Masri, a German citizen. [El-Masri was kidnaped by the CIA while on vacation in Macedonia on December 31, 2003. He was flown to a torture center in Afghanistan, where he was beaten, starved, and sodomized. The US government released him on a hilltop in Albania five months later without money or the means to go home.]</li>
<li>2005 cable re &#8220;widespread severe torture&#8221; by India, the widely-renowned &#8220;world&#8217;s largest democracy&#8221;: The International Committee of the Red Cross reported: &#8220;The continued ill-treatment of detainees, despite longstanding ICRC-GOI [Government of India] dialogue, have led the ICRC to conclude that New Delhi condones torture.&#8221; Washington was briefed on this matter by the ICRC years ago. What did the United States, one of the world&#8217;s leading practitioners and teachers of torture in the past century, do about it? American leaders, including the present ones, continued to speak warmly of &#8220;the world&#8217;s largest democracy&#8221;; as if torture and one of the worst rates of poverty and child malnutrition in the world do not contradict the very idea of democracy.</li>
<li>The United States overturned a ban on training the Indonesian Kopassus army special forces — despite the Kopassus&#8217;s long history of arbitrary detention, torture and murder — after the Indonesian President threatened to derail President Obama&#8217;s trip to the country in November 2010.</li>
<li>Since at least 2006 the United States has been funding political opposition groups in Syria, including a satellite TV channel that beams anti-government programming into the country.</li>

<p>What did the last decade accomplish in the occupation of <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/021004.html">Afghanistan</a>? Other than streamlining the opium shipment trade, what did this foreign expedition achieve?<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_casualties_in_Afghanistan">Wikipedia</a> reports, &#8220;As of December 29, 2011, there have been 2,765 coalition deaths in Afghanistan as part of ongoing coalition operations (Operation Enduring Freedom and ISAF) since the invasion in 2001.&#8221; This may seem a small number by recent loss standards, but the excuse of fighting the CIA invention and bogyman, Al Qaeda is the height of hypocrisy.Not much, comfort for the Pat Tillman family or confidence in the inept cover-up mission to silence would be whistleblowers. The convenient idiot Osama bin Laden overstayed his usefulness. Too bad that Seal Team 6 knew too much to risk their loyalty on future escapades. The sick foreign policy that orders the ritual killings of their own military trained assassins offers up their heroes as necessary sacrifices for the New World Order.</p>
<p>The Insider provides several mainstream media references in the article; <a href="http://www.theinsider.org/news/article.asp?id=0228">CIA created al-Qaeda and gave $3 BILLION to Osama bin Laden</a>. &#8220;The US government trained, armed, funded and supported Osama bin Laden and his followers in Afghanistan during the cold war. With a huge investment of $3,000,000,000 (three billion US dollars), the CIA effectively created and nurtured bin Laden&#8217;s al-Qaeda terrorist network using American tax-payers money.&#8221;The definitive source in opposition to the Afghanistan debacle, <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/blog/category/asia/afghanistan/">antiwar.com</a> is invaluable. Back in 2009, Philip Giraldi wrote in<a href="http://original.antiwar.com/giraldi/2009/11/25/the-cost-of-war/">The Cost of War</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Why are these wars so expensive? The main supply route starts in Karachi, Pakistan, and works its way up through the Khyber Pass, at which point the truck convoys are frequently attacked by insurgents. When a convoy is destroyed the US Army assumes the loss as no one will insure such a perilous enterprise. Sometimes the trucking companies pay off the attackers to be left alone, ironically putting US taxpayer-provided money into the hands of those seeking to kill American soldiers.</p>
<p>The Pentagon estimates that the cost of fuel delivered to the front lines in Afghanistan and Iraq averages $45 per gallon, including all expenses but excluding legacy costs like interest on borrowing money to buy the fuel in the first place.</p>
<p>A total of one trillion dollars has been spent already in Iraq and in Afghanistan but legacy costs to include paying off the money that was borrowed and medical care for the many thousands of wounded soldiers and marines will drive the total cost of the war past the $5 trillion dollar mark even if the two wars were to end tomorrow.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7JYxx0DS7h4" frameborder="0" width="480" height="315"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over two years ago, a video entitled, <a href="http://youtu.be/7JYxx0DS7h4">Afghanistan War Is a Failure</a> provided a visual account of the &#8220;so called&#8221; progress on the ground. The NeoCon &#8220;chicken hawks&#8221; will dismiss the losses as regrettable but necessary. That is the basic issue. What is essential about keeping foreign legions on distant soils when the cause for such deployment is based upon a false premise? As long as the phony war on terror is used to wage aggressive warfare and maintain a permanent garrison presence, victory will never bring national security.The conflict between using military combat forces and private contractors for implementing search and destroy operations poses a serious issue. While both are voluntary participants, the public would want to deny that each is a mercenary. Separated by the pay scale may seem harsh to many, but the patriotic enlistee is often in training to become a Blackwater thug. Burning Koran’s is just learning the drill before graduating to work for the corporate elite.</p>
<p>Now the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Code_of_Military_Justice">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> is certainly a welcome standard for conduct, but pirate <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204319004577089021757803802.html">Xe Services</a> armies, are restrained only by their own demons. Such reliance on using private black bag enforcers is hardly consistent with the illusive notion of nation building. Endemic corruption is inevitable when money and brute force controls the border. Paying tribute in order to wage war exemplifies the absurdity of the military machine. Their only fear is the ending of the campaign.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hfCZTITbxEE" frameborder="0" width="480" height="315"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The You Tube <a href="http://youtu.be/hfCZTITbxEE">Blackwater / Xe May Get $1 Billion Afghanistan Training Contract Despite Failure with Border Police</a> video illustrates this sentiment.Aspiring Rambo’s fighting the next Charlie Wilson’s exploit lacks the self-defense excuse of being the victim of First Blood. The Taliban that was shipped stinger missiles to defeat the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan were the product of a policy gone awry. <a href="http://emperors-clothes.com/docs/pak.htm">Selig Harrison</a>from the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars states,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The CIA made a historic mistake in encouraging Islamic groups from all over the world to come to Afghanistan.&#8221; The US provided $3 billion for building up these Islamic groups, and it accepted Pakistan&#8217;s demand that they should decide how this money should be spent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The consequences of this legacy are devastating. The covert army that operates in Afghanistan to engage in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/22/world/asia/22policy.html?_r=1">Obama’s Wars</a> is a well-known fact. Author of Watergate fame, Bob Woodward reveals in his book, that the <a href="http://www.reallyreality.com/f7/bob-woodward-c-i-has-3-000-man-%93covert-army%94-afghanistan-counterterrorism-pursuit-teams-1201/">C.I.A. has a 3,000 man &#8220;covert army&#8221; in Afghanistan counterterrorism pursuit teams</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Called, &#8220;C.T.P.T., mostly Afghans who capture and kill Taliban fighters and seek support in tribal areas. Past news accounts have reported that the C.I.A. has a number of militias, including one trained on one of its compounds, but nothing the size of the covert army.</p>
<p>Mr. Woodward reveals the code name for the C.I.A.’s drone missile campaign in Pakistan, Sylvan Magnolia, and writes that the White House was so enamored of the program that Mr. Emanuel would regularly call the C.I.A. director, Leon E. Panetta, asking, &#8220;Who did we get today?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9TX_R9R4oJs" frameborder="0" width="480" height="315"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The video <a href="http://youtu.be/9TX_R9R4oJs">3,000 CIA-trained Afghan assassins in Afghanistan and Pakistan</a>, expands on this operation. Roaming goon squads inflicting increased levels of atrocities is a demented extension of an evil empire.Historically, Afghanistan is probably one of the least desirable locations to carry on maneuvers. However, the imperialist empire must demonstrate its ability to project and drone anyone to death. It seems that all the hard-learned lessons of Viet Nam are lost. The memory banks of the officers that direct and carry out the dictates of a civilian authority, who love to play soldier, pervert their command. Playing video games is not entertainment when human body parts explode from bombs that rain down from the sky.</p>
<p>Standing down and rejecting unlawful orders are the supreme duty that escapes most military careerists. The fear of Courts Martial proceedings <a href="http://www.inforipple.com/2011/03/military-members-the-constitution-and-lawful-orders/">10 U.S.C. § 502 and 5 U.S.C. § 3331</a> keep the system shouting gung-ho.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/afghanistan.jpg" alt="afghanistan.jpg" width="240" align="Left" /></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It seems appropriate that military members swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States rather than simply swearing to support and defend the United States simpliciter. This is significant. It means that military members are more than just neutral tools of the political party in power. This oath places an affirmative responsibility on military members to read and understand the Constitution, to recognize the source and limits of the authority they have, and to uphold the specific system of government that the Constitution sets forth.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Afghanistan adventure, in now the longest imperium war, that even the mass media laments. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/afghan-war-now-longest-war-us-history/story?id=10849303">ABC news</a> observes,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Vietnam and Afghanistan do have this much in common: they are distant, profoundly complex, and ill-understood campaigns. Not surprisingly, then, they defy easy resolutions. And, in their own ways, these two wars have tested the mettle and patience of a nation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The &#8220;mettle and patience&#8221; of the military is the real concern. As long as there is no draft, crisis of conscience are confined to those who succumb to obeying illegal orders for trumped up assignments. The American empire is a prime cause and reason for the destruction of the nation. The government is not the country nor is it legitimate when it acts as a belligerent.</p>
<p>The War on Terror is a pseudo fraud. Claims of an existential threat to America are bogus. The despotic War Party regime that fosters continuous international intervention wants a perpetual state of war. The hysteria that keeps citizens in a self-delusional trance pushes the military into uninterrupted carnage.</p>
<p>Alexander the Great discovered the limits of the Macedonian empire in Afghanistan. The English also discovered the hard way. Rudyard Kipling’s poem <a href="http://www.everypoet.com/archive/poetry/Rudyard_Kipling/kipling_the_young_british_soldier.htm">THE YOUNG BRITISH SOLDIER</a> sums up well.</p>
<p align="center">When you&#8217;re wounded and left on Afghanistan&#8217;s plains,</p>
<p align="center">And the women come out to cut up what remains,</p>
<p align="center">Jest roll to your rifle and blow out your brains</p>
<p align="center">An&#8217; go to your Gawd like a soldier.</p>
<p align="center">Go, go, go like a soldier,</p>
<p align="center">Go, go, go like a soldier,</p>
<p align="center">Go, go, go like a soldier,</p>
<p align="center">So-oldier ~of~ the Queen!</p>
<p>A <a href="http://publicintelligence.net/cia-report-on-soviet-war-shows-futility-of-military-efforts-in-afghanistan/">CIA report</a> concludes that the lessons learned from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan indicate: &#8220;There is no single piece of land in Afghanistan that has not been occupied by a Soviet soldier . . . no single military problem that has arisen and not been solved, and yet there is still no result.&#8221; Unfortunately, the most prolific attribute of American foreign policy is stupidity. The palpable explanation is that the best interests of the country are suppressed for the benefits of the ruling global elite. It is time to recognize that ill-placed patriotism is a guarantee for destruction.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Afghanistan-war-03.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Afghanistan-war-02.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>I read somewhere that if you want your children to do what you tell them to do, there are only two things that actually work:  Threats and bribes.  Well, the same thing should be true with regard to international relations &#8212; but it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>Internationally speaking, threats and bribes have obviously gotten American corporatist leaders absolutely nowhere.</p>
<p>After decades and decades of administering extremely serious threats and fantastically huge bribes (involving both Cold Wars and hot), American corporatists still aren&#8217;t even close to being obeyed &#8212; or even respected &#8212; by most other countries on this planet.  American corporatists nowadays are just simply being hated.</p>
<p>Instead of having other countries instantly obey Washington and Wall Street like they were a bunch of obedient and/or traumatized children, all these so-called &#8220;kids&#8221; obviously have become passive-aggressive haters instead &#8212; and sometimes not all that passive as well.</p>
<p>Take Pakistan for instance.  In 1947, shortly after it had become a nation, Pakistan willingly and happily signed on to become one of America&#8217;s most important allies in the Great Game.  And now, as of May 2011, diplomatic ties between Pakistan and the U.S. have completely disintegrated &#8212; but only after a very long time (60 years-plus) spent with Pakistan being the recipient of a whole laundry list of heavy-duty threats and almost-obscene bribes from American corporatists.</p>
<p>I just got back from a friend&#8217;s birthday party &#8212; where I received the entire 411 on Pakistan from a Middle East expert standing over by the hors d&#8217;oeuvre table.  &#8220;When American troops entered Pakistan in [alleged] pursuit of bin Ladin, then Pakistanis considered that as an invasion.&#8221;  Okay.  Invasion seems like a rather large threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;So now Pakistan has finally stopped being our close ally and, thanks to Washington&#8217;s bad timing, has become a rogue state with a nuclear bomb &#8212; a loose cannon &#8212; instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the matter of US-Pakistan relations, threats and bribes clearly haven&#8217;t worked.  Oops.  Sorry about that.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s Iran.  Currently, our corporatist-controlled mainstream media is busy spreading erroneous rumors that Iran has a nuclear weapons program &#8212; and should be stopped at any cost.  Even Elizabeth Warren, who surely should know better, is swallowing up this falsehood hook, line and sinker.  What nuclear weapons program?  Iranians don&#8217;t have one.  But even if they did, who could blame them for wanting one after having spent the past 45 years at the business-end of corporatist America&#8217;s threats and bribes.</p>
<p>But we all know that the corporatists&#8217; latest flurry of war-drum-beating is, once again, not about nuclear weapons or other WMDs&#8211; it&#8217;s all about oil.  But even so, threats and bribes clearly haven&#8217;t worked with regard to stealing Iran&#8217;s oil either.</p>
<p>Losers.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s good old Macedonia.  &#8220;Huh?&#8221; you might shrug.  &#8220;What&#8217;s Macedonia got to do with all this?&#8221;  Well, American corporatists, at considerable expense to us ever-gullible American taxpayers, has just built a HUGE new military complex in Macedonia &#8212; because it is within bombing range of the Middle East.  So.  Did you know that American corporatists now have an exciting new vacation home in good old Macedonia?  I thought not.</p>
<p>Plus don&#8217;t forget Afghanistan.  According to that expert I met at the birthday party over guacamole and cheese sticks, American corporatists&#8217; interests (as compared to the interests of just poor slobs like you and me, mere voters and taxpayers) will NEVER let U.S. troops leave Afghanistan.  &#8220;Why is that?&#8221; I asked, while reaching for the Gouda and rye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of its strategic location, right next door to both Pakistan and Iran &#8212; and, of course, to Russia and China.&#8221;  Four countries who have the chutzpah to withstand American corporatist takeovers.</p>
<p>So American corporatists now have huge bases in Afghanistan and Macedonia (and don&#8217;t forget Israel, Iraq and Kuwait) &#8212; whose main purpose seems to be to surround Iran, Pakistan, Russia and China with huge threats.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s one more country that I forgot to mention where corporatist threats and bribes may not be working either &#8212; America itself.  Even despite all the recent tear gas in Oakland and New York City and all the happy promises offered by Fox News, Americans are also starting to wise up and act like rebellious children &#8212; Hansel and Gretel to be specific.</p>
<p>Carrots and sticks.  Threats and bribes.</p>
<p>However, American corporatists are NOT dealing with little kids here &#8212; but rather with adult human beings and sovereign nations.  And so their authoritarian theory of threats and bribes &#8212; a theory that appears to work well on easily-cowed kindergarteners &#8212; is not doing so good when forced down the throats of grown-up countries like Iran, Pakistan, Russia, China, and even the U.S.</p>
<p>As evidenced by the failure of Washington&#8217;s and Wall Street&#8217;s multi-trillion-dollar post-WWII foreign policies that have forced the rest of the world&#8217;s 99 percent into today&#8217;s sorry state of disequilibrium between uber-rich and downtrodden, threats and bribes just don&#8217;t work all that well in the sphere of international relations.  Cooperation between nations and peoples works better.</p>
<p>And, come to think of it, encouraging cooperation also works better on <a href="http://www.learnoutloud.com/Catalog/Self-Development/Parenting/Children-Are-from-Heaven/20469">real children too!</a></p>
<p>PS:  The birthday party turned out to be a great success.  A birthday was celebrated, deep ideas were discussed &#8212; and there was plenty of food.  And speaking of food, I also talked to an expert on America&#8217;s failing food production system.  Apparently our lack of food supply sustainability is gonna screw up America&#8217;s future bigtime, happily giving us cancer, among other things.  [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL1pKlnhvg0">Monsanto &amp; Cancer Milk:  Fox News Kills Story and Fires Reporters</a>]</p>
<p>And I also talked to someone who stated that the future of America ultimately depends on the success or failure of its small businesses &#8212; not on placating huge greedy corporations who will do anything for money.  &#8220;Did you know that WalMart opens approximately 30 big-box stores per month?  And that each one of these monsters causes at least ten small local business to fail because they can&#8217;t compete with WalMart&#8217;s artificially-lowered prices, sweat-shop imports and tax breaks received for outsourcing?&#8221;</p>
<p>He also lamented the fact that, over in Afghanistan, authorities openly ask for baksheesh because baksheesh is an accepted custom, understood for what it is:  A bribe.  &#8220;But over here in America, these same bribes are disguised and made legal by being called various fog-enshrouding names such as building permit fees, business licenses, liquor licenses, tax codes requirements, parking charges, payments to for-profit health insurance companies, etc. that nickel-and-dime American small businesses to death.  But baksheesh is baksheesh, no matter what you call it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Threats and bribes.  Not working!  Let&#8217;s try cooperation instead.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/multiculturalisminthewest-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/multiculturalisminthewest-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>Each week, the media reports racially motivated attacks on different races in America.  Last summer, “flash mobs” leaped into the spotlight in Wisconsin where black youths ran around beating up white people. Also in New Jersey. Mayor Nutter told the flash mobs, “Don’t embarrass your race.”  On the East Coast this week, the FBI arrested four police officers for beating up Hispanic citizens and illegal immigrants.  In Los Angeles, Mexican immigrants form gangs that specifically chase African-Americans out of their neighborhoods according to the late radio talk show host Terry Anderson.   Racial tension surfaces daily across America whether reported upon or lost in the conglomeration of news.  The FBI arrested a Denver, Colorado Muslim immigrant Jamshid Muhtorov (Uzbekistan refugee) this week for supporting the terrorist Islamic Jihad Union in the USA.</p>
<p>Today in America, we suffer from “honor killings”, arranged marriages, female genital mutilation and a host of ongoing rituals such as cock fighting by recent immigrants into the United States.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, politicians like New York Mayor Bloomberg tell us that our diversity and multiculturalism are our strengths and create a more dynamic country.  When in fact, multiculturalism is:</p>
<p><strong>CREATING NATIONAL DISUNITY</strong></p>
<p>The United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and all of Europe suffer from the tentacles of multiculturalism.  In a recent report in Oslo, Norway, where my brother has lived for 30 years, 99 percent of the rapes of Norwegian women came at the hands of Muslim immigrants. Sweden features similar percentages.  In reality, diversity fails on every level.</p>
<p>While our Congress forces multiculturalism down our throats, those members live in gated communities to escape the results. They send their children to private schools.   While high powered movie stars prance and parade with celebration of multiculturalism, they return to their gated and guarded homes in Hollywood for a peaceful night’s rest away from the gunfire in the multicultural streets of Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>Multiculturalism discounts and demeans the host country’s culture</strong></p>
<p>In Boulder, Colorado, mothers, driving $40,000 SUVs sporting “Celebrate Multiculturalism” bumper stickers, drive their kids to all white schools or enroll them in private schools so their children escape the poverty, linguistic chaos and tensions in schools like Mapleton Elementary where the illegal aliens’ children dominate classrooms.</p>
<p>Australian writer Cameron McKenzie said, “Multiculturalism is an unsound political theory, advocated by liberals, academics, media personnel, social theorists, government officials and politicians. While it is supported by those people, it is actually opposed by the overall majority of Australians.</p>
<p>“It is a deliberate policy to actively maintain, support and build foreign cultures in Australia, to the direct detriment of the Australian identity, culture and way of life. Instead of allowing immigrants, and their native-born offspring to naturally assimilate into the Australian culture, governments are knowingly creating bases of foreign culture in this country. These deliberately divisive policies are carried out in two areas.”</p>
<p>The United Kingdom, France and Holland find themselves struggling to maintain their own language and cultures.  They’re losing.  The greater numbers of the immigrants the faster host countries lose their language, cultures and cohesiveness.</p>
<p><strong>America and Canada continue on similarly self-destructive paths</strong></p>
<p>First, most American businesses feature a phone recording of press “1” for Spanish and “2” for English.  In Detroit, Michigan, you may press “3” for Arabic. By losing our U.S. language, at some point, we will not maintain our identity as a single people but a polyglot of cultures and languages—all fighting among ourselves.</p>
<p>Secondly, continued mass immigration overwhelms America’s culture and creates “pods” of immigrant cultures that remain alien and antagonistic to America’s equal rights for women, children’s rights, religious rights and free speech.  These new enclaves can be called “mirco-nations” within our own nation.</p>
<p>As the immigrants remain alienated as to language and culture, they form gangs. In Denver, where I live, we house 12,000 gang members that spray paint, ransack, steal, vandalize and run drug rings.  Those ethnic gangs prey on our citizens and their own.</p>
<p>As Australian Professor Blainey stated: &#8220;Recent governments emphasize the merits of a multicultural society and ignore the dangers. And yet the evidence is clear that many multicultural societies have failed and that the human cost of the failure has been high. Many of our refugees actually come from multicultural societies that are faltering or in disarray.” Also, Professor Loring Danforth has admitted that, &#8220;Ironically, Australia&#8217;s own commitment to multiculturalism may also encourage immigrants to involve themselves in the national conflicts of their homelands. This policy of multiculturalism &#8230; defines people in ethnic categories and makes it possible for them to maintain their identities as Italians, Greeks, or Macedonians. Multiculturalism, with its emphasis on community languages and ethnic media, promotes the development of these ethnic identities and impedes the development of a strong Australian national identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We do not need a crystal ball to see where multiculturalism will lead us,” said McKenzie.  “The future will bring a vast amount of inter-ethnic rivalry and resultant clashes, even leading to race riots reminiscent of those clashes in the UK and USA. Australia faces the spectre of being another dis-unified &#8220;multicultural&#8221; society like Sri Lanka, South Africa, Northern Ireland, Lebanon, the former Yugoslavia, Fiji, etc.; not to mention the USA and the UK, with their continually strained communities, and occasional race riots. The prospects of such a dis-unified nation are appalling.”</p>
<p>What will you do fellow Americans to stop mass immigration and multiculturalism?</p>

			<p><em>Excerpts from a speech to the H.L. Mencken Club, Baltimore, October 23, 2010</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/SerbiaGayPrideParade3.jpg" ><img src='http://www.novakeo.com/images/SerbiaGayPrideParade2.jpg' alt='Serbia' class='alignnone' /></a>Two weeks ago the first “gay pride parade” was staged in Belgrade. Serbia’s “pro-European” government had been promoting the event as yet another proof that Serbia is fit to join the European Union, that is has overcome the legacy of its dark, intolerant past. Thousands of policemen in full riot gear had to divide their time between protecting a few hundred “LBGT” activists (about half of them imported from Western Europe for the occasion) and battling ten times as many young protesters in the side streets.</p>
<p>The parade, it should be noted, was prominently attended by the U.S. Ambassador in Belgrade Mary Warlick, by the head of the European Commission Office, Vincent Degert of France, and by the head of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Mission in Serbia, Dimitris Kipreos. Needless to say, none of them had attended the enthronment of the new Serbian Patriarch a week earlier. Two days later, Hillary Clinton came to Belgrade and praised the Tadic regime for staging the parade.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clinton et al are enjoying the fruits of one man’s two decades of hard work in Eastern Europe. George Soros can claim, more than any other individual, that his endeavors have helped turn the lands of “Real Socialism” in central and eastern Europe away from their ancestors, their cultural and spiritual roots. The process is far from over, but his Open Society Institute and its extensive network of subsidiaries east of the Trieste-Stettin line have successfully legitimized the notions that only two decades ago would have seemed bizarre, laughable or demonic to the denizens of the eastern half of Europe.</p>
<p>The package was first tested here in America. Through his Open Society Institute and its vast network of affiliates Soros has provided extensive financial and lobbying support here for</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legalization of hard drugs</strong>: We should accept that “substance abuse is endemic in most societies,” he says. Thanks to his intervention the terms “medicalization” and “non-violent drug offender” have entered public discourse, and pro-drug legalization laws were passed in California and Arizona in the 90s.</li>
<li><strong>Euthanasia</strong>: In 1994 Soros—a self-professed atheist—launched his Project Death in America (PDIA) and provided $15 million in its initial funding. (It is noteworthy that his mother, a member of the pro-suicide Hemlock Society, killed herself, and that Soros mentions unsympathetically his dying father’s clinging on to life for too long.) PDIA supports physician-assisted suicide and works “to begin forming a network of doctors that will eventually reach into one-fourth of America’s hospitals” and, in a turn of phrase chillingly worthy of Orwell, lead to “the creation of innovative models of care and the development of new curricula on dying.”</li>
<li><strong>Population replacement</strong>: Soros is an enthusiastic promoter of open immigration and amnesty &amp; special rights for immigrants. He has supported the National Council of La Raza, National Immigration Law Center, National Immigration Forum, and dozens of others. He also promotes expansion of public welfare, and in late 1996 he created the Emma Lazarus Fund that has given millions in grants to nonprofit legal services groups that undermine provisions of the welfare legislation ending immigrant entitlements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Soros supports programs and organizations that further abortion rights and increased access to birth control devices; advocate ever more stringent gun control; and demand abolition of the death penalty. He supports radical feminists and “gay” activists, same-sex “marriage” naturally included. OSI states innocently enough that its objectives include “the strengthening of civil society; economic reform; education at all levels; human rights; legal reform and public administration; public health; and arts and culture,” but the way it goes about these tasks is not “philanthropy” but political activism in pursuit of all the familiar causes of the radical left—and some additional, distinctly creepy ones such as “Death in America.”</p>
<p>Soros’s “philanthropic” activities in America have been applied on a far grander scale abroad. His many foundations say that they are “dedicated to building and maintaining the infrastructure and institutions of an open society.” What this means in practice? Regarding “Women’s Health” programs in Central and South-Eastern Europe, one will look in vain for breast cancer detection programs, or for prenatal or post-natal care. No, Soros’s main goal is “to improve the quality of abortion services.” Accordingly his Public Health Program has focused on the introduction of easily available abortion all over the region, and the introduction of manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) abortion in Macedonia, Moldova, and Russia. Why is Soros so keen to promote more abortions? Overpopulation cannot be the reason: the region is experiencing a huge demographic collapse and has some of the lowest fertility rates in the world. Unavailability of abortions cannot be the answer either: only five European countries had more abortions than live births in 2000: the Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Belarus, Romania and Ukraine. The only answer is that Soros wants as few little European Orthodox Christians born into this world as possible.</p>
<p>Soros’s Public Health Programs additionally “support initiatives focusing on the specific health needs of several marginalized communities,” such as “gays” and AIDS sufferers, and promote “harm reduction” focusing on needle/syringe exchange and supply of methadone to adicts. His outfits lobby governments to scrap “repressive drug policies.” Over the past decade and a half the Soros network has given a kick-start to previously non-existent “gay” activism in almost all of its areas of operation. The campaign for “LGBT Rights” is directed from Budapest, publishing lesbian and gay books in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia and Slovakia, opening Gay and Lesbian Centers in Ukraine and Rumania. Its activists routinely attack the Orthodox Church as a key culprit for alleged discrimination of “LGBTs.”</p>
<p>Education is a key pillar of Soros’s activities. His Leitmotif is the dictum that “no-one has a monopoly on the truth” and that “civic education” should replace the old “authoritarian” model. Even under communism Eastern Europe has preserved very high educational standards, but the Soros Foundation seeks to replace the old system with the concept of schools as “exercise grounds” for the “unhindered expression of students’ personalities in the process of equal-footed interaction with the teaching staff, thus overcoming the obsolete concept of authority and discipline rooted in the oppressive legacy of patriarchal past.” The purpose of education is not “acquisition of knowledge”: the teacher is to become the class “designer” and his relationship with students based on “partnership.” Soros’s reformers also insist on an active role of schools in countering the allegedly unhealthy influence of the family on students, which “still carries an imprint of nationalist, sexist, racist, and homophobic prejudices rampant in the society at large.”</p>
<p>“Racism” is Soros’s regular obsession, but he had a problem finding it in racially non-diverse East European countries. This has been resolved by identifying a designated victim group—gypsies (“Roma”). His protégés now come up with policy demands to “protect” this group that could have been written by Rev. Jesse Jackson:</p>
<ul>
<li>anti-bias training of teachers and administrators;</li>
<li>integration of Romani history and culture in the textbooks at all levels;</li>
<li>legally mandated arffirmative action programs for Roma;</li>
<li>tax incentives for employers who employ them;</li>
<li>access to low-interest credit for Roma small family businesses;</li>
<li>setting aside a percentage of public tenders for Roma firms;</li>
<li>legislation to fight “racism and discrimination” in housing;</li>
<li>adoption of “comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation”;</li>
<li>creation of mechanisms “to monitor implementation of anti-discrimination legislation and assist victims of racial discrimination in seeking remedies”;</li>
<li>recognition by governments of “the Roma slavery and the Holocaust through public apology along with urgent adoption of a package of reparatory measures.”</li>
</ul>
<p>A budding race relations industry is already in place, with the self-serving agenda of finding “discrimination” in order to keep itself in place for ever.</p>
<p>To make his agenda appear “normal” to the targeted population, millions of East Europeans are force-fed the daily fare of OSI agitprop by “the Soros media”—the term is by now well established in over a dozen languages—such as the B-92 media conglomerate in Serbia.</p>
<p>The social dynamics Soros uses to penetrate the target countries is interesting. To thousands of young East Europeans to become a “Soroshite” represents today what joining the Party represented to their parents: an alluring opportunity to have a reasonably paid job, to belong to a privileged elite, for many to travel abroad. The few chosen for the future new Nomenklatura go to Soros’s own Central European University in Budapest. In all post-communist countries Soros relies overwhelmingly on the sons and daughters of the old Communist establishment who are less likely to be tainted by any atavistic vestiges of their native soil, culture and tradition. The comparison with the janissary corps of the Ottoman Army is more apt than that with the Communist Party. The new janissaries, just like the old, have to prove their credentials by being more zealous than the Master himself.</p>
<p>The key ideological foundation for Soros’s beliefs is the same: that all countries are basically social arrangements, artificial, temporary and potentially dangerous. A plethora of quotes from his writings will make it clear that he thinks that owing allegiance to any of them is inherently irrational, and attaching one’s personal loyalty to it is absurd. Like Marx’s proletarian, Soros knows of no loyalty to a concrete country. He could serve any—or indeed all—of them, if they can be turned into the tools of his Wille zur Macht. In 1792, it could have been France, in 1917 Russia. Today, the United States is his host organism of choice because it is so powerful, and its media scene is open to penetration by his rabidly anti-traditionalist and deeply anti-American worldview and political agenda.</p>
<p>Textbooks and educational curricular reforms pushed by Soros in Eastern Europe indicate that he is trying to perform crude dumbing down of the young. Within months of coming to power in October 2000 the “reformists” within Serbia and their foreign sponsors insisted that schools—all schools, from kindergarden to universities—must be reformed and turned from “authoritarian” institutions into poligons for the “unhindered expression of students’ personalities in the process of equal-footed interaction with the teaching staff, thus overcoming the obsolete concept of authority and discipline rooted in the opressive legacy of patriarchal past.” They started with primary schools, with a pilot program of “educational workshops” for 7-12 year olds. The accompanying manual, sponsored by UNICEF and financed by the Open Society, denigrades the view that the purpose of education is acquisition of knowledge and insists that the teacher has to become the class “designer” and his relationship with students based on “partnership.”</p>
<p>The reformers devote particular attention to the more active role of schools in countering the allegedly unhealthy influence of the family on students, which “still carries an imprint of nationalist, sexist, [anti-Roma] racist, and homophobic prejudices rampant in the society at large.” The time-honored Balkan tradition of slapping childrens’ bottoms when they exceed limits is now presented in the elementary classroom as a form of criminal abuse that should be reported and acted upon. Traditional gender roles are relativized by “special projects” that entail cross-dressing and temporary adoption of opposite gender names.</p>
<p>Soros’s vision is hostile even to the most benign understanding of national or ethnic coherence. His core belief—that traditional morality, faith, and community based on shared memories are all verboten—is at odds even with the classical “open society” liberalism of Popper and Hayek, by whom he swears. His hatred of religion is the key. He promotes an education system that will neutralize any lingering spiritual yearnings of the young, and promote the loss of a sense of place and history already experienced by millions of Westerners, whether they are aware of that loss or not. Estranged from their parents, ignorant of their culture, ashamed of their history, millions of Westerners are already on the path of alienation that demands every imaginable form of self-indulgence, or else leads to drugs, or suicide, or conversion to Islam or some other cult.</p>
<p>To understand Soros it is necessary to understand globalization as a revolutionary, radical project. In the triumph of liberal capitalism, the enemies of civilization such as Soros have found the seeds of future victory for their paradigm that seeks to eradicate all traditional structures capable of resistance. The revolutionary character of the Open Society project is revealed in its relentless adherence to the mantra of Race, Gender and Sexuality. His goal is a new global imperium based that will be truly totalitarian. But he is making a colossal miscalculation. He does not realize that the unassimilated and unassimilable multitudes do not want to be the tools of his will to power. Illegal aliens in America, Algerians in France, Turks in Germany and Pakistanis in Britain have their own, instinctive scenario, and it does not entail leaving Soros and his ilk in positions of power, or alive.</p>

			<p><em> The Israeli recipe for dealing with the world: “If force does not work, use more force.”</em> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/TurkeyKey3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/TurkeyKey2.jpg" alt="comic" /></a>Bombs go off in Turkey &#8212; a  great spree  of terrorist bombings and attacks. Practically every day Turkish  soldiers and  civilians are being killed. The killings are done ostensibly by the Kurd   terrorists of the PKK, but in reality it is a new step in Israel’s  warfare  against Turkish independence. Encouraged by Israel, the PKK has extended  its  operations to the Aegean and the Black Sea resorts all the way to Izmir.</p>
<p>Israelis have armed, supplied  and  trained Kurdish terrorists for many years; they have turned Iraqi  Kurdistan into  their own territory, with <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/report-idan-ofer-visited-kurdistan-1.298197"> many Israeli businessmen</a> going about their affairs while waiting for Kirkuk oil to flow to Haifa as it did in the  days of  colonial British rule. The Kurds have remained a hidden tool of Israel  in the  region for many years; their activation now shows that Israel still  wants to  teach the Turks a lesson.</p>
<p>The main neocon   magazine in the US, frontpagemag.com, has openly  <a href="http://frontpagemag.com/2010/06/24/turkeys-deception/"> called</a> for  the Kurds to retaliate for Turkey’s support of Palestine. Another Jewish   right-wing think-tank  <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2010/06/21/congressmen-talk-turkey/"> speaks</a> of  mobilizing the US Congress to condemn the one-hundred-year-old Armenian  tragedy  as a means of undermining Turkey.  After many years of siding with  Turkey, the  Jewish Lobby has now decided to switch sides and support the Armenian  claims. So  Turkey is now under attack from all sides. This was to be expected, for  the  popular Israeli slogan says: “If force does not work, use more force.”</p>
<p>This is the explanation of the  Flotilla  Massacre on May 31, 2010. The <em>Mavi</em> <em>Marmara</em> attack was intended to be a  short,  sharp shock to the increasingly independent Turks. The Israelis intended  to  terrify and frighten them into obedience; this is why they ordered a  blood bath  on board the <em>Mavi</em> <em> Marmara</em>. As we now know, the Israeli commandos began shooting  well  before encountering any resistance. They were not there to play  softball;  submission was what they were after. Murder was not a result of being  surprised  or of miscalculation: it was an open attack on Turkey.</p>
<p>Israel’s conflict with Turkey  was not an  unfortunate result of the murderous raid. The confrontation between them  became  acute two weeks before the massacre, on May 17, 2010. Together with  Brazil,  Turkey had arranged and signed the Tehran Declaration &#8212; a nuclear fuel  swap  deal with beleaguered Iran. This declaration could have derailed the  US-Israeli  plans of sanctioning Iran to death prior to bombing it.</p>
<p>Israel wants Iran destroyed; as  much as  she wanted Iraq demolished, Gaza starved and the rest cowed. The swap  agreement  undermined all the logic behind the sanctions. All the plotting of  Israeli  lobbyists in the US and Europe was wiped out in an instant. Indeed, as  the  Muslims say: they plot, but Allah plots better.</p>
<p>Israel received the news of the   Turkey-Brazil-Iran agreement as a heavy blow. “We were defeated by the  crafty  Turks and Iranians,” read the headlines of Israeli newspapers. Not so  fast! The  US State Department minimized the damage, effectively  <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/u-s-turkey-brazil-fuel-swap-deal-with-iran-is-too-little-too-late-1.292815"> asking</a>:  “Who cares what these lowlifes agree about? If we have decided to bomb  somebody,  bomb we shall. We shall never allow the facts to confuse us.” Thomas  Friedman in  the NYT was  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/opinion/26friedman.html"> disappointed</a> that “a Holocaust-denying thug” was being allowed to live.</p>
<p>Brazenly disregarding the  agreement, the  UN Security Council approved the sanctions on June, 9. Moscow and  Beijing were  bribed or blackmailed to agree. China preferred to play ball in order to  avoid  confrontation over North Korea. The story of the sunken South Korean  ship had  provided a pretext for an attack on North Korea, and such an attack  could cause  much damage to China. The Chinese are also vulnerable to Western  meddling in Xinjiang and Tibet.</p>
<p>The Russians have received some  precious  gifts: the Ukraine was returned to Russia’s fold, Georgia was  marginalized, the  new nuclear arms treaty was better for Russia than anything they could  have  expected. At the same time, Moscow suffered a severe terrorist attack,  reminding  the Russians of their enemies’ ability to seed trouble. Notwithstanding,  Turkey  voted against the sanctions, proving its new regional role as a reliable  new  pivot for the Middle East.</p>
<p>The conflict between Turkey and  Israel  did not start with the Iran swap: it began earlier, in January 2010,  when the  Israeli deputy Foreign Minister Dani Ayalon invited the Turkish ambassador and  publicly  <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3833259,00.html"> humiliated him</a>.  In Oriental fashion, Ambassador  Chelikkol was offered  a seat  on a sofa lower the Ayalon’s  armchair. Ayalon  refused to shake hands with the ambassador and told journalists in  Hebrew while  the cameras were rolling: “We would like to show that he takes a lower  seat and  there is only the Israeli flag on the table”.</p>
<p>Or  perhaps the  conflict began  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/31/world/europe/31turkey.html"> a year earlier</a>,  in January 2009, when the Prime Minister of Turkey,  Recep  Erdogan, walked off the  stage at  the World Economic Forum in Davos. Erdogan was annoyed by the attempt of a  Western  moderator to cut off his angry response to Israeli president Shimon  Peres, who  had justified the mass killings in Gaza.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it started in  September 2007  when Israeli planes flew over Turkey to bomb Syria without as much as  ‘by your  leave’.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was even earlier,  when Turkey  began to assert its independence by discarding its century-old,  shop-worn  ideology of Kemalism. The secular  nationalism of  Mustafa Kemal Ataturk   was a trap for the former Empire. Brutish Kemalist   Turkey was necessarily a member of NATO, an enemy to Arabs and Iranians,  a  docile client of the US, a loyal ally of Israel and a persecutor of the  Kurds.</p>
<p>Now is the time to thank the  Europeans  for doing their bit to reform Turkey. In endless negotiations with  Turkey, the  European Union demanded a release of the Army’s iron grip on power.  Without this  gentle prompting from Europe, Turkey would still be ruled by a Zionist  general  or by a Zionist generals’ appointee. With their people freed from  military rule,  the Turks ended their violent secularism and regained peace with Islam  and with  their neighbours.</p>
<p>I visited Turkey last  Christmas, and met  with the activists who were about to depart for Gaza. Turkey is doing  well: no  economic crisis, steady growth, peace with the Kurds, a brave attempt to  make  peace with Armenians, and a perfect balance of religion and freedom.  Whoever  wishes to may go to a beautifully restored Ottoman mosque and pray, or  to a café  and drink very good Turkish wine. Girls are forced neither to shed their  scarves  nor to cover their arms.</p>
<p>“We lost Turkey”,  <a href="http://spectator.org/archives/2010/06/14/who-lost-turkey-not-europe/"> said</a> Robert Gates, the US Secretary of Defense, and blamed the European Union  for  refusing to accept Turkey. But we have to thank the Europeans for this  refusal.  We do not want Turkey in the EU; we need Turkey for ourselves, for the  region.</p>
<p>There is a great new plan for  creating  an Eastern Union as a regional equivalent of the European Union. This is  the  right place for Turkey, at the head of this new formation. In a way, it  will be  restoration of the Ottoman Empire &#8212; to the same extent that the  European Union  is a restoration of Charlemagne’s empire. The difference is that Europe  was  fragmented for centuries, while our region was united until 1917. Even  if full  political union is a distant prospect, this is good start on the way to  this  worthy goal.</p>
<p>There are already free-trade  treaties  between Turkey and its Arab neighbours; the spiritual dimension is  there, for  Istanbul was the last seat of the Caliphate and the see of  Constantinople  Patriarchate. Now Turkey may establish a regional International Court to  deal  with regional problems &#8212; among others, with Zionist excesses. Europe is  still  not free from Zionist control and that is why the International Court of  Justice  and International Criminal Court in The Hague are unsuitable places to  try  Zionist criminals. Moreover, their present location recalls the  Eurocentric  world of yesterday. A regional court may also convincingly deal with war   criminals in occupied Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries. Great  lawyers  like Richard Falk and Judge Goldstone could be invited to sit in it.</p>
<p>The establishment of the  International  Court (East) would be a serious and realistic step towards further  decolonization of the region and its future unification in an Eastern  Union.</p>
<p>However, the Eastern Union will  be as  different from the Ottoman Empire as the European Union differs from the  Third  Reich, that previous attempt to unite Europe. It will be a voluntary  union of  sovereign states, where they all will preserve their unique cultures and   traditions, a good neighbour to united Europe, to Russia, Iran and  China.</p>
<p><strong>Looking beyond the Middle  East</strong></p>
<p>The Union could peacefully  spread well  beyond the Middle East as well, reuniting its natural territories from  Gibraltar  to Danube. This natural territory was formed a long time ago, in the  fourth  century, when the mighty Roman Empire was divided into the Western  Empire with  its capital in Rome, and the Eastern Empire, or Byzantium, with its  capital in  Constantinople, as Istanbul was then called. The Byzantine Empire became  the  Ottoman Empire in 1456. Still, it is the same ‘great space’, the same  united  large civilization of Muslims and Eastern Christians. People of Turkey  and  Greece, Serbia and Egypt have the same attitudes, they share their  common  values, they are more religious than their Western brethren, they object  to the  Western colonization, American imperialism and Israeli Zionism.</p>
<p>The rising West could not  vanquish the  united East; so in order to colonize its lands, the West has tempted the  nations  with a futile dream of independence. This mirage of independence was but  a trap:  the new “liberated independent” countries became subjects of Western  rule. We  may compare that with a human body: if our arms and legs will become  independent  of our mind, they won’t manage well. Indeed all members of the single  body, the  Ottoman Empire, do not function well after the amputation, or  independence,  forced upon them.</p>
<p>That was the case with the  Arabs during  World War I. The Arab Revolt was brought forth by Lawrence of Arabia, a  great  agent of British intelligence. The Arab lands became much more dependent  than  they ever were, and now they are ruled by a plethora of sheiks, stooges  and  dictators. The only democratic regime in the whole Arab world is  unhappy,  besieged Gaza.</p>
<p>However, the Arabs were not the  only  victims of these Western policies. The British intrigues had caused  Greece’s  independence in early 19<sup>th</sup> century, and afterwards rivers of  blood  and transfers had made this separation complete. But Greece is not at  home in  the EU, just as Greece of old was not at home in the Empire ruled from  Rome. The  recent financial crisis has proven it again: Greece’s roots and destiny  are in  the East.</p>
<p>No sane person would suggest  that Greece  should be incorporated in Turkey. Equally, none would suggest France be  incorporated in Germany. However, France joined Germany to form the EU,  and  Greece may join Turkey to create the Eastern Union, eventually to  embrace other  Muslim and Orthodox Balkan provinces of the Byzantines, namely Albania  and  Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro, even Romania and Georgia. All these  countries  may find the Eastern Union more suitable than the European one.</p>
<p>The Eastern Union may reach  other  countries and former provinces that were torn away and colonized by the  Europeans in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Algeria is a country that  needs this  reconnection most of all, as this oil-rich land is run by a bunch of  secular  anti-religious and pro-Western generals just like Turkey was until ten  years  ago. Morocco with its outdated and unsuccessful monarchy that combines  systematic torture of dissidents with abject Zionism, maverick Libya and  fragile  Tunis also need a broader framework which would not cancel out but  instead  reinforce their sovereignty.</p>
<p>The Eastern Union could also  establish  an area of joint interests with the Russians over the Caucasus. Russians  have a  problem over there: separation of these Russian provinces is too  dangerous as it  is likely to bring the hostile forces of NATO into Russia’s backyard.  Keeping  them against the population’s will is an expensive and unpopular policy.  A  Russian attempt to grant independence in all but name to Chechnya  misfired as  the small country immediately turned its territory into a base of armed  raids  into Russia proper. The Eastern Union could put paid to these  insurgencies and  bring peace and stability to the turbulent Caucasus. In return, the  Union may  recognize Russian interests in the Christian Orthodox sites.</p>
<p>Palestine will become a crown  jewel of  the Eastern Union. Demise of colonialism will end Zionism as well, for  after  all, Zionism would never win ground without European imperialist  support. The  Christians, Jews and Muslims of Palestine will have equal rights and  duties in  the Holy Land, forever free from political ambitions and ethnic rivalry.</p>

			<p>By Lauren Booth</p>
<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/Lauren-Booth3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/Lauren-Booth2.jpg" alt="Lauren Booth" /></a>One of the most striking trends following the flotilla attack has been how quickly Israeli hasbara is being exposed by internet journalists. The doctored IOF audio clips, where amateurs with mock Arab accents hiss ‘Go back to Aushwitz’ to Israeli naval officers. Well they didn’t take long to pull apart did they? Then there are the (so-pathetic-they’re-almost-funny  claims the flotilla was linked to Al Quaeda. I laughed out loud to read in an Israeli paper that humanitarian activist (and former US marine) Ken O’Keefe was going to Gaza to; ‘train a commando unit in Hamas.’ I know Ken fairly well. Quite frankly I’m not sure who should be more insulted by this stupidity him or Hamas? Either way flinging the words ‘Hamas’ ‘Jihadists’ and ‘Israel’s security’ around is no longer having the same shock and awe effect on journalists or the public at large.</p>
<p>The internet now shapes the world’s story, not the Israeli Foreign Ministry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, like a soccer star caught cheating on his wife. Instead of saying &#8216; I messed up big time, forgive me&#8217; Israeli government sources and other shysters are screaming; ‘it’s not fair to watch us all the time, that&#8217;s mean!’ and ‘this is our business, leave us alone!&#8217; Bad luck for them that as it stands, more of the IDF&#8217;s minging dirty washing, is being aired in public than ever before; via facebook and twitter. The Zionists sobs of &#8216;no faiirrrr!&#8217; are sounding ever more bizarre. But more about the Isra-bots later on.</p>
<p>Israeli Intelligence (some mistake surely?) have been busy since the massacre. Erasing the memory sticks and hard disks of what my premiliminary research estimates to be  some 800 video cameras, around 1200 mobiles and 600 lap tops. All items, looted from the passengers of the Freedom Flotilla, whilst they kneeled, handcuffed and in stress positions, on the hot deck of the Mavi Marmara for up to 12 hours after the attack.  Before the bots cry &#8216;why so much money on board, why so many cameraaas!&#8217; Let me explain, the good individuals on board had been raising money for months in the local communities around the world to take useful gifts tot eh people, schools and children of the besieged Gaza Strip. Besides which -the cameras were the only &#8216;weapons&#8217; those on board had with which to arm themselves in the event of an attack at sea.</p>
<p>Now, evidence is emerging, that having been forced (by Turkish hard line diplomacy) to release all of the kidnapped passengers sooner than it would have liked; Israel is (as usual) taking revenge on the Palestinian relatives of activists onboard. Those who seek to non violently oppose Zionist policies of Apartheid violence are having loved ones interrogated by the Shabak as you read this for merely sailing with the Freedom Flotilla. I am not at liberty to say much more for fear of even further reprisals on innocent people. But as you should by now be aware, the Israeli machine specialises in collective punishment. This week a spokesman in the US said live on air that &#8216;Children in Gaza were under siege because their parents voted Hamas.&#8217; Too much to say on that, so I&#8217;ll leave it hanging for you to take in</p>
<p>Last night in London, as in so many cities this week, Freedom flotilla passengers addressed a packed open meeting. At the Conway Hall in Central London half a dozen British survivors, looked in turns spaced out and hardened by their experience, eleven days ago (is that all it is? How the world turns!).</p>
<p>Jamal El Shayyal, is the Al Jazeera reporter who kept broadcasting as gun shots rang out behind him on the upper decks of the Mavi Marmara. I honestly thought I had heard, read and seen the worst about the Israeli attack on the fleet’s passengers. I hadn’t. Believe me,  nor have you. Those three minutes clips, miraculously  broadcast live or smuggled out beneath tongues, reveal the merest inkling of the horrors these brave people witnessed. And suffered.</p>
<p>El Shayyal, told an utterly silent audience he ‘had been invited by IHH to film every inch of the ship.’ So he did. From the bowels of the hull to the uppermost decks he filmed.</p>
<p>‘I checked and filmed’ he said ‘there was not 1 weapon onboard. Not one gun. no lethal artillery. The most lethal thing on the ship was fruit and vegetables.’</p>
<p>When the Israeli commandos attack began Jamal was wearing his pyjamas under a life jacket as were so many of the allegedly ‘prepared terrorists on board.’ Helicopters caused a near hurricane on the decks, all satellite phones were jammed (deliberately to stop SOS calls to the rest of the world). And, so the IDF hoped, any factual reports of what was about to occur.</p>
<p>At this point, just after four thirty am, Jamal saw a Turkish passenger shot in the top of his head. He spoke slowly and clearly to make sure he was understood by us all in the hall.</p>
<p>‘No Soldier was on the ship at this time’.</p>
<p>Quickly another passenger removed a white t-shirt from a bag and used it as a white flat of surrender. When gun shots rang out, greater numbers fell. It was clear calls for mercy were to be ignored. That a shoot to kill policy was in place.</p>
<p>An Israeli member of the Knesset and Lubna (an activist who also speaks Hebrew) took turns making announcements over the tannoy in English and then Hebrew. Announcements made atleast 8 times;</p>
<p>‘We have critically injured people here, please can you come and get them. We are NOT armed. We SURRENDER!’</p>
<p>Soon the tannoy connection was cut off.</p>
<p>Sarah Colborne of the PSC and another passenger negotiated with soldiers for the evacuation of some atleast of the mounting injured. Many of the bleeding would not go with the Israeli’s. Fearing they would be less safe  getting ‘treatment’ from the troops, than below decks being operated on without anaesthetic. </p>
<p>‘The Israelis were asked for a stretcher’ continued Jamal ‘for a man with severe internal bleeding to be moved. Use a sleeping bag we were told.’ The man was moved in agony on a blanket no doubt increasing his injuries. And his immense pain. Did he survive? We’ll never know.</p>
<p>As the shooting gave way to the enforced imprisonment of the passengers, or, let’s give it its right name &#8211; kidnapping, Jamal was pushed to the floor, cuffed and beaten. His posessions taken from him. It was morning on a bright, sunny, summer’s day by now. Hundreds of shocked men were taken on deck, hands bound behind their backs. Three, then four hours passed. Pleas were made to use the toilet. No water was given, they were kicked, spat at and punched by soldiers who passed by every few minutes. Eventually Jamal pursuaded one soldier to let him go to the toilet, ‘with my hands still bound behind my back.’ One man in his eighties trying to get back to his family in Gaza, was jeered  by soldiers, in his discomfort. After many hours, he suffered the indignity of urinating on himself, in front of both friends and fiends.</p>
<p>At some point Jamal was taken back downstairs. The area had been thoroughly ransacked.</p>
<p>‘There was no respect for human rights or dignity. Holy books of all faiths had been thrown about, possessions strewn everywhere”.</p>
<p>He remembers one quietly spoken Muslim brother asking soldiers gently several times for his cuffs to be loosened, just slightly. The third time he asked one of them tightened them so much that ‘he gave a scream of agony that made us all feel sick to our stomachs.’</p>
<p>In the afternoon the ship was forced into Ashdod port. Pushed ashore by armed guards Jamal was greeted with the words; ‘Welcome to Israel. Are you enjoying your time here?’</p>
<p>The Al Jazeera journalist wanted us all to understand something very clearly. That the civilian passengers were not ‘detained’ nor ‘arrested.’ They were plainly and in every legal definition of the word ‘Kidnapped, abducted.’</p>
<p>In Beersheva prison, he was placed in a cell, with a leader from the Turkish human rights group, IHH. They had no food for 24 hours, just a few sips of water. They had no idea if the world knew where they were &#8211; or what had happened. In other parts of the prison, consular reps from Greece, France, Spain and Macedonia could be heard shouting at the Israeli captors demanding the release of their compatriots. Yelling that rights were not being respected, yelling for food, water, access to legal representation. From the British consul.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Finally when every other consul had visited the abducted civilians, a British rep turned up. Jamal described the obsequious nature of the visit in termas that make one cringe. Bowing and scraping to the Israelis, the British diplomat didn’t even push for the right to see the victims in a private area. A legal imperative for all detainees during such visits.  He didn’t demand water, or food, or a release time for those he was supposedly representing. Under the gaze of Israeli soldiers he asked just two questions ; ‘what is your name and what is your home number in the UK.’ Then our citizens were left.  Wondering about their fate and that of their comrades; hungry, afraid, shocked, alone.</p>
<p>When the Israeli’s knew the game was up, that the world had  indeed seen clips of their murderous attack, the Turkish abductees were given the chance to leave quickly, in an hour.</p>
<p>Did they go? No. They refused point blank to leave ‘before every other nationality has left before us.’ We salute them.</p>
<p>Jamal, Osama, Alexandra, Sarah, Kevin, and four hundred other internationals were released ONLY because of  Turkish support for them. Not because the international community stepped in. Not because of action by the UN or (God forbid), the UK government. Because of the Turkey government.</p>
<p>In all his time as a prisoner, some forty hours plus, Jamal, like all the other Brits, had no legal visit, no phone call home and no proper British representation.</p>
<p>Finally at Ben Gurion airport being deported from a place he never wanted to enter in the first place. Jamal was given a piece of paper with a photo of himself on it and Hebrew writing.</p>
<p>His interrogator smirked at him and led him towards the plane ‘Congratulations’ the man said. ‘This is your new passport.’</p>
<p>‘I want my old passport!’ Said Jamal.</p>
<p>‘Sue me!’ Came the reply.</p>
<p>There was more much more from the survivors, which was videotaped and I will post as soon as it comes online. But let’s get back to the Zio-bots now. For alongside Press TV cameras and PSC workers filming the testimonies, there was the compulsory, sulky faced Zionist, shooting footage of the event for some organization opposed to justice, and free speech. Curiously, as the survivors described their horrors in depth, this woman’s camera was aimed  NOT at the stage. But at my Press TV colleagues.</p>
<p>I went outside for a cigarette and there she was again.  Instantly recognisable as a tight lipped Proto Zionist. She asked if I was with Press TV and would I speak to her for “Israeli TV?” Clearly she was not from any broadcaster &#8211; as no valid news channel accepts shaky, amateur hand held footage of the sort she was producing. Curious about her real intentions, I said &#8216;with pleasure.&#8217;</p>
<p>‘So do you think Press TV has done enough to give the Israeli side of events concerning the flotilla?’</p>
<p>Did I pause? It felt like a must have, just to have the time to process that after an hour of harrowing testimony about a massacre, this woman, had heard and felt &#8211; nothing.</p>
<p>‘The BBC has given Mark Regev enough space for your cause don’t you think..” I replied</p>
<p>‘Yes but don’t you think Press TV ought to&#8230;.’ and then it happened. The white rage. I heard children crying in Gaza, saw fishermen being shot along the coast, phosphorous plummeting onto schools and UNWRA food stores. I saw the massacre on the Freedom Fleet, the torture, the needless, avoidable death..</p>
<p> ‘Go fuck yourself’ I heard myself saying. And to make sure I couldn’t be misquoted I added.</p>
<p>‘Just fuck off.’ </p>

			<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/Eisenhower-d-day2.jpg" alt="Eisenhower - Paratroopers" />Most of us Americans have a deep and abiding respect and admiration for our country&#8217;s fighting men who have served&#8211;and are serving&#8211;within the US Armed Forces. We appreciate their willingness to put themselves in harm&#8217;s way for the preservation of our nation&#8217;s liberty and independence. We honor their sacrifice. Indeed, many of us share that sacrifice with the deaths, dismemberments, and paralysis of our most cherished loved ones who were killed or injured in the line of duty.</p>
<p>It is time, however, that we awaken to the reality of what our military is becoming and where it is heading. Suffice it to say, this is not your father&#8217;s army.</p>
<p>On December 8, 1941, my father, Ed Baldwin&#8211;along with his two brothers, Bud and Gene&#8211;marched down to a recruiting office in Little Rock, Arkansas, to enlist. The Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor the day before, and no branch of service had to beg people to enlist that day. Bud joined the Navy. Gene joined the Marines. When government officials saw Dad&#8217;s resume, they selected him to help construct the atomic bomb. All three brothers served their country with distinction throughout the war.</p>
<p>But what all of us need to realize is, World War II was the last constitutionally fought war in which America has been engaged. The United Nations was created at the end of WWII, and ever since then, our military forces have increasingly become the &#8220;peacekeeping&#8221; arm of that evil institution.</p>
<p>Since WWII, American forces have fought major wars in South Korea, South Vietnam (including Laos and Cambodia), Kosovo, the Persian Gulf (Kuwait), Iraq, Afghanistan, and now Pakistan&#8211;all for the benefit of the United Nations. Add to these major wars lesser conflicts (except to those Americans killed or wounded in them) such as Lebanon, Dominican Republic, Congo (Zaire), Iran, El Salvador, Libya, Grenada, Honduras, Chad, Panama, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Macedonia, Bosnia, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Tanzania, and Somalia. And this does not take into account the countless CIA-sponsored Black Ops missions that have taken place all over the world.</p>
<p>Yes, American forces have been used to both put people in power and take people out of power all over the world. And as often as not, the people we put in power were counted among the &#8220;bad guys,&#8221; while the people we removed from power were &#8220;good guys.&#8221; Remember, our own CIA was the organization most responsible for the rise to power of Osama Bin Laden. And it was the US government that surreptitiously set up the murder of Dr. Jonas Savimbi, who was one of the best friends the United States had overseas. Plus, does anyone remember how the US treated our friend, the Shah of Iran? Yes, some of us are old enough to remember when Iran was one of the best friends we had in that region of the world.</p>
<p>But mind you, not one single war in which American forces have been engaged since WWII has been constitutionally fought. Not one!</p>
<p>Ever since the United Nations was created, its interests have dominated the usage of US forces. In fact, our military today is quickly morphing into the tip of the spear for a burgeoning, global New World Order. To those with eyes to see, the evidence is everywhere. It&#8217;s not even being hidden anymore. Have you seen that new US Navy television commercial? It boldly proclaims, &#8220;The US Navy: A GLOBAL FORCE For Good.&#8221; (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p>This politically correct, UN-dominated New World Order has changed (and is changing) our US military right before our eyes. It has taken the greatest and proudest independent fighting force in the world&#8211;one created to defend the people and property of the United States&#8211;and turned it into a global military policeman for the evil Machiavellians at the UN.</p>
<p>In order to convert the US military into a true &#8220;Global Force,&#8221; several changes are being forced upon our fighting men.</p>
<p>First, more and more women are entering the US military.</p>
<p>Currently, women comprise about 20% of military personnel. And for the first time in US history, women are actively engaged in combat units in the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The massive integration of women in combat may serve the interests of political correctness, but it does not serve the interests of combat effectiveness. Neither does it serve the interests of family and child rearing. And I don&#8217;t care how old fashioned that sounds!</p>
<p>Wives and mothers are the backbone of family nurturing. To willingly take mothers away from their children&#8211;and subject both mother and child to the separation and suffering that military life demands&#8211;is both unnatural and cruel.</p>
<p>And there is another stark reality that few people want to discuss: the fact that 30% of all women in the US military are raped. Yes, you read it right: 30%.</p>
<p>According to <em>NPR</em>, &#8220;In 2003, a survey of female veterans found that 30 percent said they were raped in the military. A 2004 study of veterans who were seeking help for post-traumatic stress disorder found that 71 percent of the women said they were sexually assaulted or raped while serving. And a 1995 study of female veterans of the Gulf and earlier wars, found that 90 percent had been sexually harassed.&#8221;</p>
<p>See the report at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103844570">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103844570</a></p>
<p>Government and military brass know that the introduction of women into the military environment (especially the combat environment) is reaping problems of epidemic proportions, but they are deliberately ignoring and even covering them up.</p>
<p>For example, does anyone recall the name Jamie Leigh Jones? According to ABC News, &#8220;A Houston, Texas woman says she was gang-raped by Halliburton/KBR coworkers in Baghdad, and the company and the U.S. government are covering up the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jamie Leigh Jones, now 22, says that after she was raped by multiple men at a KBR camp in the Green Zone, the company put her under guard in a shipping container with a bed and warned her that if she left Iraq for medical treatment, she&#8217;d be out of a job.&#8221;</p>
<p>See the report at:<br />
<a href=" http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=3977702&#038;page=1"></p>
<p>http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=3977702&#038;page=1</a></p>
<p>And this story leads into another phenomenon being created within this New World Order army: the way our government and military are increasing their use of &#8220;private&#8221; or &#8220;independent&#8221; contractors. In the past, these people were always known simply as mercenaries. Call them what you will, mercenaries are now a major component of the way our government wages war.</p>
<p>According to <em>Global Research</em>, &#8220;The growing use of private armies not only subjects target populations to savage warfare but makes it easier for the White House to subvert domestic public opinion and wage wars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Americans are less inclined to oppose a war that is being fought by hired foreign mercenaries, even when their own tax dollars are being squandered to fund it.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The increasing use of contractors, private forces, or, as some would say, &#8220;mercenaries,&#8221; makes wars easier to begin and to fight&#8211;it just takes money and not the citizenry,&#8217; said Michael Ratner, of New York&#8217;s Center for Constitutional Rights. &#8216;To the extent a population is called upon to go to war, there is resistance, a necessary resistance to prevent wars of self-aggrandizement, foolish wars, and, in the case of the United States, hegemonic imperialist wars.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>See the report at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&#038;aid=14972">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&#038;aid=14972</a></p>
<p>Remember, at any given moment, there might be as many&#8211;if not more&#8211;mercenaries fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan as there are US military forces. For example, according to the Christian Science Monitor, in early 2008, the number of mercenaries fighting in Iraq numbered more than 190,000. Remember, in addition to the benefit of not drafting US citizens to fight these perpetual wars (and thus avoid incurring the wrath and resistance of the American public), mercenaries enjoy the luxury of not having to comply with the military rules of engagement. And the stories of atrocities committed by US-employed mercenaries in Iraq and Afghanistan are too numerous to list.</p>
<p>In addition to the Jamie Jones case mentioned above, consider the case where Blackwater (now called Xe) mercenaries mowed down 17 Iraqi citizens in an unprovoked attack. And, of course, no one at Blackwater was held accountable for these murders. Reports of abuse, cruelty, and savagery by mercenaries in Iraq are commonplace. According to the Global Research report, &#8220;Many soldiers of fortune on private payrolls previously served dictators in South Africa, Chile, and elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <em>Washington Post</em> quotes Brigadier General Karl Horst, an advisor to the U.S. Joint Force Command as saying, &#8220;These guys [mercenaries] run loose in this country [Iraq] and do stupid stuff. There&#8217;s no authority over them, so you can&#8217;t come down on them hard when they escalate force . . . They shoot people, and someone else has to deal with the aftermath. It happens all over the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>And you wonder why the United States is viewed so negatively around the world?</p>
<p>Granted, there is a place and proper use for mercenaries. Fred E. Foldvary, Senior Editor of The Progress Report, rightly observes, &#8220;One alternative to U.S. military action against terrorists who have attacked the U.S. and other countries, and are threatening further attacks, is to enact Letters of Marque and Reprisal. Article I, Section 8, paragraph 11 of the U.S. Constitution authorizes Congress to &#8216;grant letters of Marque and Reprisal and make rules concerning captures on land and water.&#8217; A &#8216;reprisal&#8217; means an action taken in return for some injury. A reprisal could be a seizing of property or guilty persons in retaliation for an attack and injury. It could include forces used against the perpetrators for the redress of grievances. A reprisal could even involve killing a terrorist who is threatening further harm and cannot be captured.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Marque&#8217; is related to &#8216;marching&#8217; and means crossing or marching across a border in order to do a reprisal. So a letter of Marque and Reprisal would authorize a private person, not in the U.S. armed forces, to conduct reprisal operations outside the borders of the U.S.A.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such Letters are grantable not just by the U.S. Constitution, but also by international law, which is why it was able to be included in the Constitution. The Letters are grantable whenever the citizens or subjects of one country are injured by those in another country and justice is denied by the government of that country, as happened with the attack by persons who were in Afghanistan.&#8221;</p>
<p>See Foldvary&#8217;s column at:<br />
<a href=" http://www.progress.org/fold232.htm"></p>
<p>http://www.progress.org/fold232.htm</a></p>
<p>And that is exactly what Congressman Ron Paul attempted to do. He proposed H.R. 3076, the September 11 Marque and Reprisal Act of 2001, to authorize the U.S. State Department to issue such Letters. See Dr. Paul&#8217;s Press Release at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press2001/pr101101.htm">http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press2001/pr101101.htm</a></p>
<p>However, neither the Congress nor the White House&#8211;Democrat or Republican&#8211;has any intention of following the Constitution; therefore, Letters of Marque and Reprisal were never authorized. As a result, no authority has been granted to these mercenaries to wage war on behalf of anyone, especially not the people of the United States.</p>
<p>But what unauthorized mercenaries do accomplish is to fulfill the demands of internationalists and globalists to use unaccountable and uncontrolled (at least by normal military protocols) private armies for their own personal and nefarious purposes.</p>
<p>The next step for our politically correct &#8220;Global Force&#8221; is the authorization for homosexuals to serve openly in the US military. This has long been the goal of globalists, and it is now about to happen.</p>
<p>It was globalist President Bill Clinton who introduced the current &#8220;Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell&#8221; policy that allows homosexuals to serve in the US armed forces&#8211;but not openly. Of course, this was a major departure from US military history. From George Washington&#8217;s Continental army until the Clinton administration, homosexuality was deemed &#8220;incompatible&#8221; with military service. And now globalist Barack Obama is leading Congress to change the policy even further by allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the US military.</p>
<p>However, please consider this: if our governmental and military leaders would cover up the raping of American servicewomen by servicemen, don&#8217;t you know that they will cover up the raping of American servicemen by homosexual servicemen? Mark this down: mixing sex (heterosexual or homosexual) and military service is a recipe for disaster. And the potential damage inflicted upon military units (especially combat units) is exacerbated exponentially by the introduction of large numbers of homosexuals and women into those units. (This is the universal sentiment of virtually every active duty or retired serviceman I have ever spoken with.) But it does fit perfectly into the plans of the New World Order architects, who want to use the US military as much for the advancement of their politically correct agenda as they do for any actual military purpose.</p>
<p>Plus, dare I mention how that many violent gangs in North America are encouraging their members to join the US military in order to learn tactics and skills, which enable them to more effectively inflict their criminality upon the American people? Well, it&#8217;s true. And our military brass knows it&#8217;s true, and yet they still allow these thugs to enter our military. Hispanic gang members, especially, are entering the US military in droves.</p>
<p>According to a report in The <em>American Conservative</em> magazine, &#8220;[R]ecent figures indicate that gang membership in the Armed Forces significantly surpasses civilian levels. Stars and Stripes reported that 1 to 2 percent of the military are gang members, compared to 0.02 percent of the general population.&#8221;</p>
<p>See the report at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amconmag.com/article/2008/may/05/0012/">http://www.amconmag.com/article/2008/may/05/0012/</a></p>
<p>No, ladies and gentlemen, it is not your father&#8217;s army. And, sadly, while many of our fine military leaders (not to mention many of our active duty soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines) see all of this taking place, they are practically powerless to stop it, because political correctness and globalism run rampant in Washington, D.C., including at the Pentagon.</p>

			<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/usa-patriot-flag-and-war-2.jpg" alt="flag" />According to Macedonian Radio and Television On-line (MRT), a Russian professor predicts the United States will fall apart in July 2010. MRT reports, &#8220;&#8216;Mr. Obama is similar to the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Gorbachev was also making great promises for the Soviet Union, but the situation was only getting worse,&#8217; he said. By next summer, according to Professor Panarin, the US will disintegrate into six blocs&#8211;and everyone will get their piece. &#8216;The probability that the United States of America fall apart in July 2010 is more than 50 percent,&#8217; said Igor Panarin, Professor at Moscow&#8217;s Diplomatic Academy within the Russian Federation&#8217;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>MRT went on to report, &#8220;Panarin came up with his grim forecast while analyzing the parallels between the Soviet Union in its final days and the current situation in the United States. &#8216;American dream ballooned seven times in 11 years. During Gorbachev era, the Soviet dream ballooned five times.&#8217; Americans hope [President] Barack Obama &#8216;can work miracles,&#8217; he wrote. &#8216;But when spring comes, it will be clear that there are no miracles.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>See the MRT report at<br />
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/mrt-report">http://tinyurl.com/mrt-report</a></p>
<p>The Drudge Report confirmed the MRT report and added, &#8220;Professor Igor Panarin said in an interview with the respected daily IZVESTIA . . . &#8216;The dollar is not secured by anything. The country&#8217;s foreign debt has grown like an avalanche, even though in the early 1980s there was no debt. By 1998, when I first made my prediction, it had exceeded $2 trillion. Now it is more than 11 trillion. This is a pyramid that can only collapse.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>At least some of what Panarin said back in the fall of 2008 either has taken place or is in the process of taking place. Drudge reported, &#8220;When asked when the U.S. economy would collapse, Panarin said: &#8216;It is already collapsing. Due to the financial crisis, three of the largest and oldest five banks on Wall Street have already ceased to exist, and two are barely surviving. Their losses are the biggest in history. Now what we will see is a change in the regulatory system on a global financial scale: America will no longer be the world&#8217;s financial regulator.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Drudge continued reporting Panarin as saying that &#8220;the U.S. will break up into six parts&#8211; the Pacific coast, with its growing Chinese population; the South, with its Hispanics; Texas, where independence movements are on the rise; the Atlantic coast, with its distinct and separate mentality; five of the poorer central states with their large Native American populations; and the northern states, where the influence from Canada is strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Panarin further suggested that Russia might even &#8220;claim Alaska.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reporting on the same story, The Wall Street Journal said, &#8220;Prof. Panarin, 50 years old, is not a fringe figure. A former KGB analyst, he is dean of the Russian Foreign Ministry&#8217;s academy for future diplomats. He is invited to Kremlin receptions, lectures students, publishes books, and appears in the media as an expert on U.S.-Russian relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The WSJ goes on to say that Panarin believes that &#8220;mass immigration, economic decline, and moral degradation will trigger a civil war next fall and the collapse of the dollar.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is not the first time that Comrade Panarin has made such a prediction. Joseph Farah, editor of World Net Daily, noted in December of 2008 that Panarin has been making similar projections for the past ten years. In a column regarding Panarin&#8217;s predictions, Farah wrote, &#8220;Until recently, no one took him very seriously. And then came the economic calamity that has rocked Americans and the rest of the world, too. Now, Panarin&#8217;s predictions of an end of the United States, due to economic and moral collapse, is being taken seriously by many.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, will the United States break up in 2010? Or 2011? Or 2012? Or anytime in the near future, for that matter? If history is any teacher, the chances would seem good that Panarin&#8217;s predictions may be closer to reality than anyone would like to admit.</p>
<p>A historian and linguist from South Africa recently wrote me a fascinating letter, in which he chronicled the major world empires of history, dating the time of their rise and fall. Here is what his calculations look like:</p>
<p>Assyria (859-612 B.C.): a 247-year reign.<br />
Persia (538-330 B.C.): a 208-year reign.<br />
Greece (331-100 B.C.): a 231-year reign.<br />
The Roman Republic (260-27 B.C.): a 233-year reign.<br />
The Roman Empire (27 B.C.-180 A.D.): a 207-year reign.<br />
The Arab Empire (634-880 A.D.): a 246-year reign.<br />
The Mameluke Empire (1250-1517 A.D.): a 267-year reign.<br />
The Ottoman Empire (1320-1570 A.D.): a 250-year reign.<br />
Spain (1500-1750 A.D.): a 250-year reign.<br />
Romanov Russia (1682-1916 A.D.): a 234-year reign.<br />
Great Britain (1700-1950 A.D.): a 250-year reign.<br />
The USA (1790-2009 A.D.): 219 years and counting.</p>
<p>My honorable historian-friend calculates America&#8217;s reign using its post-Revolutionary War years. He notes that America&#8217;s reign is currently at 219 years. He further notes that the average duration of every world superpower listed above is a little over 238 years.</p>
<p>One does not need to be a master mathematician or possess a Ph.D. to realize that America is fast approaching the mark in which every major world power in history has either collapsed or, at a minimum, lost its world leadership and power.</p>
<p>My friend also reminded me of his homeland&#8217;s (South Africa&#8217;s) demise. He told me that he noticed the handwriting on the wall in time to relocate his family to a more peaceful and stable European country. Many of his friends and countrymen were not so fortunate, however, and thousands were killed and their properties confiscated. He then warned me, &#8220;The period of Grace is closing, in what is your homeland.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, serious students of Holy Writ are also struck with the similarities between societal conditions in America and those of Old Testament Israel (as well as with Gentile nations) at those times of divine judgment and retribution. As someone trenchantly said, &#8220;If God spares the United States, He will have to apologize to Sodom and Gomorrah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Will the Russian analyst&#8217;s prophecies come true in 2010? Probably not. Does that mean that America is impervious to some sort of national demise? Not at all. Is America already in serious trouble? You bet. Could there be some sort of break-up within the United States in the near future? In my opinion, that is a very realistic probability. If this happens, will freedom suffer? Almost certainly. Will those with tyrannical tendencies use the opportunity of any national disaster to try and enslave us? They already do. I personally do not believe that there is any &#8220;If&#8221; to the question. The only questions are, &#8220;When?&#8221; and &#8220;To what degree?&#8221;</p>
<p>And, of course, there is another question: &#8220;When the break-up comes, how many Americans understand the principles of liberty enough, and are personally prepared enough, and are willing enough to resist whatever power it may be that seeks to place us under the thumb of oppression and fight for the same protections and vanguards of liberty that first established this land?&#8221; Obviously, the answer to that question is yet to be determined, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
