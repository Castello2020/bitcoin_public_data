“The world needs American leadership. The Middle East needs American leadership and I intend to be a president that provides the leadership that America respects and keep us admired throughout the world.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Paul Ryan, Congressman, Republican Party candidate for Vice President, September 12, 2012:<br />

<h3 style="color: #222222;">The question is not what pacifism has achieved throughout history, but what has war achieved?</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">Remark made to a pacifist: “If only everyone else would live in the way you recommend, I would gladly live that way as well – but not until everyone else does.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The Pacifist’s reply: “Why then, sir, you would be the last man on earth to do good. I would rather be one of the first.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, 1947, words long cherished by a large majority of the Japanese people:</p>
<blockquote style="color: #222222;">
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">“Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">“In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #222222;">This statement is probably unique amongst the world’s constitutions.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">But on July 1, 2014 the government of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, without changing a word of Article 9, announced a “reinterpretation” of it to allow for military action in conjunction with allies. This decision can be seen as the culmination of a decades-long effort by the United States to wean Japan away from its post-WW2 pacifist constitution and foreign policy and set it back on the righteous path of being a military power once again, only this time acting in coordination with US foreign policy needs.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In the triumphalism of the end of the Second World War, the American occupation of Japan, in the person of General Douglas MacArthur, played a major role in the creation of this constitution. But after the communists came to power in China in 1949, the United States opted for a strong Japan safely ensconced in the anti-communist camp. For pacifism, it’s been downhill ever since … step by step … MacArthur himself ordered the creation of a “national police reserve”, which became the embryo of the future Japanese military … visiting Tokyo in 1956, US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles told Japanese officials: “In the past, Japan had demonstrated her superiority over the Russians and over China. It was time for Japan to think again of being and acting like a Great Power.”  … various US-Japanese security and defense cooperation treaties, which called on Japan to integrate its military technology with that of the US and NATO … the US supplying new sophisticated military aircraft and destroyers … all manner of Japanese logistical assistance to the US in Washington’s frequent military operations in Asia … repeated US pressure on Japan to increase its military budget and the size of its armed forces … more than a hundred US military bases in Japan, protected by the Japanese military … US-Japanese joint military exercises and joint research on a missile defense system … the US Ambassador to Japan, 2001: “I think the reality of circumstances in the world is going to suggest to the Japanese that they reinterpret or redefine Article 9.”  … Under pressure from Washington, Japan sent several naval vessels to the Indian Ocean to refuel US and British warships as part of the Afghanistan campaign in 2002, then sent non-combat forces to Iraq to assist the American war as well as to East Timor, another made-in-America war scenario … US Secretary of State Colin Powell, 2004: “If Japan is going to play a full role on the world stage and become a full active participating member of the Security Council, and have the kind of obligations that it would pick up as a member of the Security Council, Article Nine would have to be examined in that light.”  …</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In 2012 Japan was induced to take part in a military exercise with 21 other countries, converging on Hawaii for the largest-ever Rim of the Pacific naval exercises and war games, with a Japanese admiral serving as vice commander of the combined task force.  And so it went … until, finally, on July 1 of this year, the Abe administration announced their historic decision. Abe, it should be noted, is a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, with which the CIA has had a long and intimate connection, even when party leaders were convicted World War 2 war criminals.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">If and when the American empire engages in combat with China or Russia, it appears that Washington will be able to count on their Japanese brothers-in-arms. In the meantime, the many US bases in Japan serve as part of the encirclement of China, and during the Vietnam War the United States used their Japanese bases as launching pads to bomb Vietnam.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The US policies and propaganda not only got rid of the annoying Article 9, but along the way it gave rise to a Japanese version of McCarthyism. A prime example of this is the case of Kimiko Nezu, a 54-year-old Japanese teacher, who was punished by being transferred from school to school, by suspensions, salary cuts, and threats of dismissal because of her refusal to stand during the playing of the national anthem, a World War II song chosen as the anthem in 1999. She opposed the song because it was the same one sung as the Imperial Army set forth from Japan calling for an “eternal reign” of the emperor. At graduation ceremonies in 2004, 198 teachers refused to stand for the song. After a series of fines and disciplinary actions, Nezu and nine other teachers were the only protesters the following year. Nezu was then allowed to teach only when another teacher was present.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">Yankee Blowback</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">The number of children attempting to cross the Mexican border into the United States has risen dramatically in the last five years: In fiscal year 2009 (October 1, 2009 &#8211; September 30, 2010) about 6,000 unaccompanied minors were detained near the border. The US Department of Homeland Security estimates for the fiscal year 2014 the detention of as many as 74,000 unaccompanied minors. Approximately 28% of the children detained this year are from Honduras, 24% from Guatemala, and 21% from El Salvador. The particularly severe increases in Honduran migration are a direct result of the June 28, 2009 military coup that overthrew the democratically-elected president, Manuel Zelaya, after he did things like raising the minimum wage, giving subsidies to small farmers, and instituting free education. The coup – like so many others in Latin America – was led by a graduate of Washington’s infamous School of the Americas.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">As per the standard Western Hemisphere script, the Honduran coup was followed by the abusive policies of the new regime, loyally supported by the United States. The State Department was virtually alone in the Western Hemisphere in not unequivocally condemning the Honduran coup. Indeed, the Obama administration has refused to call it a coup, which, under American law, would tie Washington’s hands as to the amount of support it could give the coup government. This denial of reality still persists even though a US embassy cable released by Wikileaks in 2010 declared: “There is no doubt that the military, Supreme Court and National Congress conspired on June 28 [2009] in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch”. Washington’s support of the far-right Honduran government has been unwavering ever since.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The questions concerning immigration into the United States from south of the border go on year after year, with the same issues argued back and forth: What’s the best way to block the flow into the country? How shall we punish those caught here illegally? Should we separate families, which happens when parents are deported but their American-born children remain? Should the police and various other institutions have the right to ask for proof of legal residence from anyone they suspect of being here illegally? Should we punish employers who hire illegal immigrants? Should we grant amnesty to at least some of the immigrants already here for years? … on and on, round and round it goes, decade after decade. Those in the US generally opposed to immigration make it a point to declare that the United States does not have any moral obligation to take in these Latino immigrants.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">But the counter-argument to this last point is almost never mentioned: Yes, the United States does indeed have a moral obligation because so many of the immigrants are escaping a situation in their homeland made hopeless by American intervention and policy. In addition to Honduras, Washington overthrew progressive governments which were sincerely committed to fighting poverty in Guatemala and Nicaragua; while in El Salvador the US played a major role in suppressing a movement striving to install such a government. And in Mexico, though Washington has not intervened militarily since 1919, over the years the US has been providing training, arms, and surveillance technology to Mexico’s police and armed forces to better their ability to suppress their own people’s aspirations, as in Chiapas, and this has added to the influx of the oppressed to the United States, irony notwithstanding.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Moreover, Washington’s North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has brought a flood of cheap, subsidized US agricultural products into Mexico, ravaging campesino communities and driving many Mexican farmers off the land when they couldn’t compete with the giant from the north. The subsequent Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) has brought the same joys to the people of that area.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">These “free trade” agreements – as they do all over the world – also result in government enterprises being privatized, the regulation of corporations being reduced, and cuts to the social budget. Add to this the displacement of communities by foreign mining projects and the drastic US-led militarization of the War on Drugs with accompanying violence and you have the perfect storm of suffering followed by the attempt to escape from suffering.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">It’s not that all these people prefer to live in the United States. They’d much rather remain with their families and friends, be able to speak their native language at all times, and avoid the hardships imposed on them by American police and other right-wingers.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">M’lady Hillary</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">Madame Clinton, in her new memoir, referring to her 2002 Senate vote supporting military action in Iraq, says: “I thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had. And I wasn’t alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong. Plain and simple.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In a 2006 TV interview, Clinton said: “Obviously, if we knew then what we know now, there wouldn’t have been a vote. And I certainly wouldn’t have voted that way.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">On October 16, 2002 the US Congress adopted a joint resolution titled “Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq”. This was done in the face of numerous protests and other political events against an American invasion.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">On February 15, 2003, a month before the actual invasion, there was a coordinated protest around the world in which people in some 60 countries marched in a last desperate attempt to stop the war from happening. It has been described as “the largest protest event in human history.” Estimations of the total number of participants involved reach 30 million. The protest in Rome involved around three million people, and is listed in the 2004 Guinness Book of World Records as the largest anti-war rally in history. Madrid hosted the second largest rally with more than 1½ million protesters. About half a million marched in the United States. How many demonstrations in support of the war can be cited? It can be said that the day was one of humanity’s finest moments.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">So what did all these people know that Hillary Clinton didn’t know? What information did they have access to that she as a member of Congress did not have?</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The answer to both questions is of course “Nothing”. She voted the way she did because she was, as she remains today, a wholly committed supporter of the Empire and its unending wars.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">And what did the actual war teach her? Here she is in 2007, after four years of horrible death, destruction and torture:</p>
<blockquote style="color: #222222;">
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">“The American military has done its job. Look what they accomplished. They got rid of Saddam Hussein. They gave the Iraqis a chance for free and fair elections. They gave the Iraqi government the chance to begin to demonstrate that it understood its responsibilities to make the hard political decisions necessary to give the people of Iraq a better future. So the American military has succeeded.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #222222;">And she spoke the above words at a conference of liberals, committed liberal Democrats and others further left. She didn’t have to cater to them with any flag-waving pro-war rhetoric; they wanted to hear anti-war rhetoric (and she of course gave them a tiny bit of that as well out of the other side of her mouth), so we can assume that this is how she really feels, if indeed the woman feels anything. The audience, it should be noted, booed her, for the second year in a row.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">“We came, we saw, he died.” – Hillary Clinton as US Secretary of State, <em>giggling</em>, as she referred to the uncivilized and utterly depraved murder of Moammar Gaddafi in 2011.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Imagine Osama bin Laden or some other Islamic leader speaking of September 11, 2001: “We came, we saw, 3,000 died, ha-ha.”</p>

			<p>In this high-speed society we created for ourselves, Americans live in traffic-congested cities with skyscrapers piercing the sky.</p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Car-Sandals3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>On the ground floor, humans race to catch crowded busses, packed subways and Yellow Cabs. With expressways gridlocked from dawn to dusk, people overflow sidewalks and sirens slash through the air 24/7. The evening news reports robberies,  accidents, homicides and a plethora of  calamities too numerous for human emotions to endure.</p>
<p>But if you look at all the people living in cities, whether in their workplace or their office cubicle, what do you see on the partition wall?</p>
<p>You see posters of what they would rather being doing: windsurfing, skiing, sunbathing on a beach in the Caribbean, scuba diving, dancing, mountain climbing, camping, rafting, bicycling and a dozen other activities they would rather be living.</p>
<p>If you’re one of those people wishing you lived a different life or wishing you could live your dreams, then why don’t you go after it?</p>
<p>Why not live your poster instead of wishing you were windsurfing across Lake Tahoe or sunning on the beach in Hawaii?</p>
<p>Did you ever wonder how those people you see traveling around the world with a backpack or bicycle, or climbing mountains or taking a winter off to go ski bumming do it?</p>
<p>They defeat the tyranny of resistance.</p>
<p>Henry David Thoreau said, “The mass of men and women live lives of quiet desperation”.</p>
<p>In 2014 America, anyone at any station in life, at any age, can renew his or her life by choice, by intention and by action. Such individuals learn how to defeat the “tyranny of resistance.”</p>
<p>First of all, what constitutes this modern day tyranny that locks people into cubicle prisons in cities or into humdrum jobs that provide zero meaning?</p>
<p>Such persons yield to an inner resistance to transform themselves because they feel afraid, don’t know how to break their cubicle-bonds and, often times, none of their office mates know any better. It’s easier to be safe with the constancy and comfort of a paycheck and friends.</p>
<p>Do you remember the TV sitcom “King of Queens” with the fat boy Kevin James and co-star Leah Remini, who also got fat in the series, staged in New York City?  They never showed any happiness, but mostly conflict. Their  jobs: meaningless! They didn’t know how to escape their relationship or their jobs.</p>
<p>If you live such a scenario, how can you avoid a lifetime of regrets?</p>
<ul>
<li>Find your gift of what turns you on to life.  Discover your talent, your ability, your genius and your expertise. You can find it by examining what you do in your spare time. Pursue it, love it and live it.</li>
<li>Practice self-awareness.  Socrates said, “The unexamined life is not worth living”. Instead of going through the motions, create your own wave and ride it.</li>
<li>Incorporate your independent will as a “course correction” on your way to your life’s destination. As Jack London said, “You can’t wait for inspiration to change your life; you have to go after it with a club.”</li>
<li>Discover your True North in the scheme of your life.  That’s your soul’s true knowing and what you desire most about your life. It’s your deepest truth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, you must engage your physical, emotional, mental and spiritual well-being.</p>
<p>Exercise daily to blow off excess energy in the body to release your mind to express itself.  Eat healthy foods to maintain a lean frame.  That, in turn, allows you  emotional balance that originates with your relationship with friends, families and co-workers.  For your mental well-being, read books, take classes and express yourself through journaling, painting, sculpting or other art forms.  Finally, feed your spiritual being via inspirational books, church or nature, and the peace you find from a walk down a tree-lined path.</p>
<p>You will find the tyranny of resistance fades as you walk or gallop toward your happiness in work, play and friends. You won’t wish for what you see in the poster on your cubicle wall, you will live it for real.</p>

<p>A few years ago I participated in a radio debate on “white privilege” with a certain man, whose name is unimportant, who had a Ph.D. in “ethnic studies.” At one point he introduced an argument by saying, “If whites are 80 percent of the population…,” which prompted me to interject and point out that whites (non-Hispanic) are now only 63 percent of America. Of course, you might think that someone with a doctorate in “ethnic studies” would know what the ethnic and racial composition of the country is.</p>
<p>While no one wants to be a real-life Cliff Clavin (of <i>Cheers</i> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6GTZrcoWEM">fame</a>), mistaking trivia for intellectualism, facts matter because they’re small snippets of reality. They’re little pictures — and, as with a jigsaw puzzle — if you have enough of them, assembled properly, you can see the big picture. This is otherwise known as being in touch with reality.</p>
<p>This is why a certain trend in that liberal bastion called education is quite interesting. Educators will often say today, “We don’t just teach kids <i>facts </i>[uttered dripping with derision]; we teach them how to think.” This is quite convenient. After all, it’s easy to test knowledge of facts; thus, such measures can reveal modern education as a fraudulent enterprise. But “how to think” is a bit more nebulous, and, if you define the expression of feelings-derived folderol as reason, your students cannot fail.</p>
<p>Yet there is a deeper reason why liberals eschew facts: they refute fiction. And since leftist agendas have no basis in reality, exposure to snippets of it is deadly; for, just as one small pin can pop a balloon, one little fact can shatter a rationalization.</p>
<p>This brings us back to Dr. Ethnic Studies. His field of expertise isn’t about anything as old-fashioned as facts, but he can expound at length on oppression, white privilege, critical-race theory and “micro-aggressions.” These things, you see, are the stuff of sophisticated modern men. Never mind that they’re complete fiction.</p>
<p>But liberals are raised on fiction. Fiction about America’s nature and Western influence; fiction about the races and sexes (not to mention “genders”), and fiction about sex; fiction about history and culture; fiction about economics; fiction about religion. Heck, with how liberals claim old fairy tales are destructive, they’re raised with fiction about fiction. This brings us to another fiction: Barack Obama as educated man.</p>
<p>If we were to mention, again, that he thought “Austrian” was spoken in Austria, pronounced “corpsman” “corpse-man” (<i>three</i> times in one speech) or that he called the “transcontinental” railroad the “intercontinental” one (Amtrak to Bangkok, anyone?), we’d obviously have to be racists. After all, anyone can make a mistake. But it’s one thing to commit a Spoonerism and say “a scoop of boy trouts” or, like Dan Quayle, correct a spelling-bee participant based upon the antiquated word form “potatoe” (which <i>The New York Times</i> used as recently as 1988). But then there are those mistakes indicating that, just perhaps, you don’t really possess the knowledge base one might expect from an educated Western gentleman.</p>
<p>And a fact about Obama’s upbringing is that it was defined by fiction. Clergyman Hosea Ballou said, “Education commences at the mother&#8217;s knee…,” but not only was Obama’s mother’s knee not around all the time, but what an odd knee it was. Her father had given her his first name, Stanley, because he’d wanted a boy, and Stanley Ann Dunham’s personal development reflected that bizarre beginning. She attended Mercer Island High in Seattle, which had a wing known as “anarchy alley” that was infested with radical leftist teachers. It is said that Dunham “thrived” in that atmosphere, and she became a committed left-wing atheist herself. Then there was Obama’s mentor in Hawaii, Frank Marshall Davis, a pornographic-novel writer and anti-white, card-carrying member of the Communist Party USA. And how radical were Obama’s leftist grandparents, with whom he lived in the AlohaState? Obama’s grandfather, Stanley Armour Dunham, was the one who chose Davis to be scrambler of young Barry’s brains.</p>
<p>The point is that there was no prominent person in the young Obama’s life who could or would expose him to reality. It was all anti-American, anti-Western isms and destructive schism. This brings us to Obama’s mind-numbingly ridiculous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpGH02DtIws">description</a> of his 2008 campaign travels: “I’ve now been in 57 states; I think, one left to go.” Where does such a bizarre mistake come from? After all, that there are 50 states is drummed into every American child so that it just instinctively rolls off the tongue: 50 states, 50 states, 50 states….</p>
<p>That is, again, every “American child.”</p>
<p>It’s not that I don’t think Obama knew there are 50 states. Rather, he doesn’t have the intellectual foundation you’d expect of an educated Western man, and this includes a lack of the rote knowledge that, like an actor who has spoken a certain line in 500 rehearsals and performances, is expressed the same way every time. And this, by the way, has nothing to do with where anyone thinks Obama was born. He simply is not truly American in mind, heart and spirit.</p>
<p>But to fully grasp the nature of leftists’ ignorance, an understanding of their philosophical foundation is necessary. There is a certain experience many conservatives know very well: You debate a liberal, and he just seems immune to facts and reason. No matter how airtight your point, it rolls off him like water off a duck.</p>
<p>To explain this, let’s start with an analogy. Becoming proficient at golf involves gaining knowledge about the swing. And if you realize you’ve fallen victim to a misconception, improvement depends upon rejecting it and accepting the truth in question. But what if you were so bent on using your old swing — so attached to “hackerism” — that you simply would not accept that truth? A pustule on the face of the game you’d remain.</p>
<p>So it is in all of life. Everyone falls victim to certain misconceptions, and growing in knowledge and wisdom involves rejecting them when we’re blessed enough to discover refutative truths. But this can be difficult for two reasons. First, it may involve relinquishing ideas to which we’re strongly attached. This could be because they’re integral pieces of an incorrect jigsaw puzzle we’ve glommed onto, an example of which would be a committed atheist who insists there are no moral absolutes because he knows their existence implies God’s. Or it could be that an incorrect belief is embraced as a justification for a behavior (e.g., sexual perversion, heavy drinking) to which we’re attached. Or it could be both.</p>
<p>Second, pride can get in the way, as correcting oneself involves admitting error, often with respect to ideas we’ve spent an entire lifetime defending. It can be like giving up a cherished son.</p>
<p>And while most everyone exhibits to some degree this tendency to rationalize, leftists are defined by it. They are, to use a favored psycho-babble term, morally and philosophically “dysfunctional” people. They live lives of rationalization — which is when you lie to yourself, sell yourself on a fiction — and for this reason only intensify whatever dislocation from reality their upbringing, sometimes, might have wrought.</p>
<p>Their greatest act of self-delusion — their ultimate denial of reality and the one that facilitates all others — is their embrace of moral relativism, the idea that there are no moral absolutes. The appeal of this fiction is that it allows one to justify any behavior imaginable. After all, my sins are not sins if there’s no vice, only viewpoint. Who is to judge? Who is to say? There’s no black and white, only gray.</p>
<p>But once you unmoor yourself from objective moral reality, there is no limit to how immoral you can become. This is why Fyodor Dostoevsky’s Ivan Karamazov said that without God, “everything is permitted.” It’s why occultist Aleister Crowley insisted, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.” And it explains leftists’ bizarre thinking. Did you ever wonder, for instance, how modern liberals can say something so preposterous as “The truth is no defense against a hate-speech charge”? It’s not hard to understand.</p>
<p>When a person who lives a sincere life finds that part of his ideology conflicts with the Truth, he alters his ideology. But what if you not only were attached to your ideology like a drunkard to drink, but didn’t acknowledge Truth’s existence? It is then that you, instead, rationalize away the Truth.</p>
<p>In fact, with his denial of Truth, the leftist places his ideology where Truth should be: the center of his life. This ideology, which just reflects his emotions, anyway, then takes on the role of God. It becomes the ultimate arbiter, the fiction that becomes “fact.” This is why Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels once said, “National Socialism is a religion. …My Party is my church….” Like him, today’s leftists have repeated a big lie to themselves so often that it has become the “truth.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, or maybe ominously, the Bible speaks of the end times in 2 Timothy 3 and writes of “men of depraved minds” who are “always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth.” I don’t know if these are the last days, or just the last days of freedom, but our republic is now infested with millions of fiction voters who elected a fiction president based on fairy-tale promises. And it’s looking less and less like our story ends with “happily ever after.”</p>

<p>It is obviously clear. President Obama is a threat not only to the American people. He is destabilizing the United States every way he can. He did this paying for Treyvon protest trying to start race wars as one example. He is a threat to world peace. He has to be neutralized before he takes the world into an age of war and destruction. Now how can that be done? Congress can pass all the impeachment bills. The US Senate will not by two thirds vote him guilty removing him from office. Politically there is very little that can be done to interpose between Obama and him destroying the world.</p>
<p>So who will step in and take action to avert a disaster from  happening?  The usurper in the White House is the most lawless President in history that makes Nixon and Clintonlook like choir boys in comparison. President Obama does not respect the Constitution and international law. He is waging war against the American people economically and shredding our Bill of Rights daily.</p>
<p>He is waging war against Christianity on the domestic front attacking religious freedom by forcing people of conscience to pay for Obamacare the pays for abortions. He is attacking Christians in the military daring to say the name of Jesus forcing chaplains to marry homosexuals against the moral conviction of the clergy. At the same time erecting Pagan places of worship on military installations. For this matter I call on the Patriots to relieve officers of duty and command who attack the religious freedom of the men and women in uniform. I do not care if the commander is a Buddhist and gay. He must respect and defend all faiths and conscience. If he is willing to follow an unlawful, immoral order without question that will weaken the fighting strength. Then the commanders and officers who carry these immoral orders need to be relieved of command.</p>
<p>President Obama is waging war on Christians in Syria, Egypt and now in Kenya. He is waging war against Christians world wide. He is a threat to the faith. He is arming the enemies of Christianity who are murdering unarmed woman and children. His actions are bringing instability to the world. He does not regard public opinion at all when it comes to gun control when the people are buying guns in record numbers and the citizens reluctance to go to war with Iran and Syria. Obama is a dangerous loose cannon that must be stopped.</p>
<p>First, Obama may be a natural born US Citizen because he was born in Hawaii. But he renounced his US citizenship becoming an Indonesian citizen taking on the name Barry Soetoro. His records are sealed where we do not know his immigration and naturalization records documenting repatriation or if he is a US citizen. Therefore he might be ineligible to hold office. Obama by his actions says he is an agent of a foreign power working against the United States. He is a domestic enemy of the United States.</p>
<p>He is arming Al Qaeda. The same terrorist that killed and maimed soldiers and Marines in Iraq and Afghanistan. Obama’s half brother is being funded by the CIA to fund the Muslim brotherhood. Obama’s cousin Odinga is destabilizing Kenya. Odinga was given advice from Obama when he was a US Senator on how to cause havoc and destabilize Kenya for political gain.</p>
<p>Now with this massacre in Nairobi Kenya killing Christians in a Shopping mall. Now there are calls for the TSA to be in Shopping Malls that are another gun free zone. It would not surprise me if there are shootings in the malls in the states to further a police state here. Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri was calling for small scale attacks on US soil. Al Zawahri is a CIA backed operative who was behind the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. Obama is the head of the Muslim Brotherhood and backs AL Qaeda therefore must be taken down and brought to justice.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A3Sec3.html">Treason is the only crime defined in the Constitution written in Article 3 section 3 saying</a>:</p>
<p>Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.</p>
<p>President Obama is commiting treason daily against the Americans people waging war every way possible to weaken our republic. He is involved in insurrection and rebellion against the laws of the Union.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_office#Federal_Executive_and_Legislative_Branch_Oaths">Under Article 6 section 3 of the US Constitution all branches in government are bound to the oath as outlined</a></p>
<p>The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the members of the several state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several states, shall be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution.</p>
<p>If we took the oath. We are all duty bound to uphold that oath against all enemies foreign and domestic.</p>
<p>Those who are commissioned Officers in the Armed forces take the oath below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.army.mil/values/officers.html">Commissioned officers taken this oath:</a></p>
<p>I, _____, having been appointed an officer in the Army of the United States, as indicated above in the grade of _____ do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservations or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter; So help me God.”</p>
<p>(DA Form 71, 1 August 1959, for officers.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.history.army.mil/html/faq/oaths.html">Enlisted personal and Non Commissioned Officers take this oath:</a></p>
<p>I, _____, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution ofthe United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the UnitedStates and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.”</p>
<p>(Title 10, US Code; Act of 5 May 1960 replacing the wording first adopted in 1789, with amendment effective 5 October 1962).</p>
<p>That oath does not say to defend unconstitutional laws and illegal orders. It does not say defend a political agenda or corrupt politicians. It does not say defend the dictator. If the laws contradict the <a href="http://ucmj.us/">USMJ</a> and the Constitution of these United States. The people in the Armed forces are duty bound not to carry out the order.</p>
<p>We are very unique because our oaths are not to a person. But to the US Constitution. The people who written the Constitution and requiring an oath of affirmation to support and defend the Constitution. Not a monarchy. They knew the British Redcoats were bound to the will of the King. Not to any morals. They had to follow the decrees of the King without question.   We do not serve a monarchy. We never swore to a dictator. We serve the cause of freedom defending and preserving our Constitution. Our oath to preserve, protect and defend out Constitution is a vital check and balance against tyranny and despotism. The UCMJ requires us to follow lawful orders and not illegal edicts that goes against the law of the land</p>
<p>President Obama through insurrection is working hard to overthrow the government ofthe United States. Obama is trying to find an excuse to declare a national emergency to place the USA under Martial law. He can announce the President is  suspending the Constitution so continuity of government declaring the President Dictator under PD-51 President Bush singed. This makes the President a Dictator under any national emergency the chief executive decides what is and what isn’t . Congress has no say to review. This is a classified document congress is not allowed to read.</p>
<p>Right now in Benjamin Fulford newsletter he says with much skepticism from a source inside the Pentagon. <a href="http://www.transalchemy.com/research/white-dragon-society/">General Staff officers are making a list of 30,000 people who are New World Order thugs including the President. All to be arrested for treason and insurrection attempting to overthrow the Constitutional government. </a></p>
<p>It has been rumored the <a href="http://patriotaction.net/profiles/blogs/confirmed-attempted-arrest-of-president-obama-linked-to-navy-ship">Provost Marshal was going to arrest Obama for attempting to detonate a nuclear device in Washington DC on the 12th Anniversary of Sept 11th</a>. The shooting in the Navy yard could be a smoke screen of the attempted arrest of Obama for treason. I can tell the Military is getting ready to act to defend this nation. When Secretary of State John Kerry signed the UN Small Arms Trade Treaty. That was an act of treason trying to repeal the Second Amendment by underhanded means using treaty law.</p>
<p>I do not see much of the Military going out to confiscate guns. It is not 2005 in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. It is a different world.</p>
<p>The Military is very awake now to the President’s treasonous ways. It is my hope the Military stands down instead  of carrying out illegal orders where Obama is crowned King Nothing.</p>

<p>I remember as a young child that the key to winning a lot of the neighborhood games in football and basketball was all about who got picked first. If you were lucky enough to get Michael on your team, then you knew you were going to win. If you were in a foreign park playing against kids you did not know, Michael was the great equalizer. I also knew that getting the right kids on my side helped in spelling bees and walking home from the movies so I didn’t get beat up. Learning how to organize my team with the right people, served me well when I became a men’s college head basketball coach in terms of winning the recruiting wars. I always felt the April recruiting wars was the deciding factor in many games in the following December.</p>
<p>America is in the choosing sides phase of the coming civil war. To use a college recruiting phrase, it is accurate to state that the letters of intent to join one side or another side, have mostly been signed and the commitments offered.  However, there is one big uncommitted piece, but very soon the sides will be drawn.</p>
<h2>The Chess Pieces of Civil War</h2>
<p>What is going on today in America is all about choosing sides. There are clear lines being formed in the United States. The recruiting pool consists of the Department of Homeland Security, the American military, local law enforcement, the Russian troops pouring into the United States, the trickle of Chinese troops coming into the country through Hawaii and, of course, the poor, the middle class and elite. This is the recruiting pool which will form the chess pieces of the coming American Civil War.</p>
<h2>The Contextual Background for Civil War</h2>
<p>Even if all parties in this country wanted the country to continue, even in its present mortally wounded state, it would be foolish to believe that it could continue for much longer.</p>
<p>There are three paramount numbers that every American should be paying attention to and they are (1) national deficit ($17 trillion dollars), (2) the unfunded liabilities debt ($238 trillion dollars), and (3) the derivatives/futures debt (one quadrillion dollars which is 16 times the entire wealth of the planet. The net result of these staggering numbers can only end one way, and that is with a financial collapse, followed by a bank holiday, rioting in the streets and the full roll out of martial law. These financial numbers guarantee that the party cannot continue much longer.</p>
<p>Since America, in her present form, cannot continue much longer without experiencing a cataclysmic shift, we would be wise to realize what resources are going to be the impetus for civil war. When you play the board game, Monopoly, the properties on Boardwalk are among the most coveted. It is no different in real life. The biggest prize of the coming conflict is real estate. Homes, office buildings and shopping malls are the most coveted prize. The MERS mortgage fraud continues unabated as millions of homes have been confiscated through mortgage fraud. When the dollar is worthless and is awaiting its replacement (e.g. the Amero or the Worldo), real estate will be more valuable than gold.</p>
<p>Other big game that is being hunted by both sides in the coming civil war will be bank accounts, which must be looted before the dormant computer digits we call money, can be converted into hard assets. That is why my advice is, and has been, convert your cash into tangible assets which can enhance your survivability in the upcoming crash.</p>
<p>Also, your pensions, your 401K’s and your various entitlement programs are also at risk as evidenced by Secretary of Treasury Jack Lew’s “borrowing” from various Federal retirement accounts in order to increase the debt ceiling fight that will resurface in Congress, again, early next year.</p>
<p>Again, my advice is to convert your assets in tangible items which will aid in getting you through some very dark days coming up in the near future. Before the cognitive dissonance crowd rears their ugly heads and accuses me of fear mongering, ask yourself what the elite did prior to the crash of the economy in 1929. For example, Joseph Kennedy took his money out of the stock market the day BEFORE it crashed. Rockefeller, Westinghouse, et al., all took their money out just prior to the crash, leaving the ignorant masses unaware of what was coming. Don’t make the same mistake.</p>
<p>Barring a false flag event, US martial law will have a trigger event, which will lead to martial law, that will be a financial collapse and it will naturally occur as we are already on a collision course with destiny. I am not ruling out other events, but the economic crash scenario is easily the most likely event.</p>
<h2>Building Fences Around the Ignorant</h2>
<p>Please allow me to ask you an ignorant question. If you knew that a virus was coming to your neighborhood which would infect much of the local canine population, wouldn’t it be prudent to build a fence around all of the dogs in the neighborhood in order to isolate any potentially infected dogs? Well, this is how the elite view you.</p>
<p>Many of us, devoid of financial resources, will soon become like a pack of rabid dogs and we must be contained. As I have written about recently, it is becoming very difficult to get your money out of the country. Banks, such as JP Morgan Chase and HSBC have already imposed withdrawal limits. If you withdraw more than $10,000 cash, you run a good chance of being investigated by the IRS. One layer of fencing has already been placed around you and your assets.</p>
<p>The NDAA constitutes another big fence being built around the people in which all due process will soon be gone. The NDAA will allow the administration the “legal” right to secretly remove any burgeoning leadership of citizen opposition forces. The second provision which will allow this country to quickly transition to martial law is Executive Order (EO) 13603 which allows the President to take control over any resource, property and even human labor within the United States. This EO gives the President unlimited authority including the ability to initiate a civilian draft as well as a military draft. In short, this spells the potential enslavement of the American people. For those of you who still have your blinders on, research the NDAA and EO 13603 and then when you realize that I am correct in my interpretation, ask yourself one question; If the powers that be were not going to seize every important asset, then why would the government give itself the power to do just that? And while you are at it, remember the Clean Water Act gives the EPA to control all private property as well as the precious resources of all water. And then of course, the FDA and the conflicts with local farmers is escalating. And if this is not enough to convince the sheep of this country that the storm clouds are overhead, then take a look at HR 347 which outlaws protesting and takes away the First Amendment. This unconstitutional legislation makes it illegal to criticize the President and the government, as a whole, in the presence of Federal officials. I have news for you, there are Federal officials in every town, city and county in America. If one violates HR 347, they will be immediately arrested and charged with a felony.</p>
<p>I just saw the <i>Hunger Games</i> sequel, <i>Catching Fire</i>, and this is eerily similar to what I saw in a lot of movies in that the people are being provoked to revolution. In fact, in the TV show, <em>Revolution</em>, the most evil entity in the series is the re-emergence of the United States government and the heroes of the show are rebelling against the abuse. It seems like everywhere we turn in the media, the people are being encouraged to rise up now and challenge authority. I am sure the establishment would rather confront a small group of dissidents and squelch the rebellion now, before the numbers can become significant and overwhelming to the establishment and this theme is being carried out in the media on a large scale.</p>
<p>Along these same lines, Obama has done nothing but agitate the middle class. I like to ask Obama supporters, can you name one thing Obama has done, on behalf of the establishment elite, to improve the plight of the American middle class? I can’t think of even one thing.</p>
<p>The fences have been built around the soon-to-be rabid dog population, so when the infected dogs go crazy, the pieces will have been put in place to deal with the uprisings that will surely follow the loss of everything. Containment is nearly complete. The final action will consist of gun confiscation and one side of the coming conflict is attempting to position themselves to do that in the near future and that would be the DHS, the Russians and the Chinese. I cannot think of another legitimate reason which would describe why these foreign troops are here.</p>
<p>Cognitive dissonance only relieves some of psychological distress for so long.</p>
<h2>Choosing Sides</h2>
<p>I have told you what is at risk before the inevitable economic crash. Now it is time to take stock of the sides of this coming civil war and a very clear picture is emerging.</p>
<p>The poor have no resources other than their food stamps which are already under attack. The middle class and their resources are the target for the coming conflict. And most of the middle class has no idea that they have been targeted. Soon the divide and conquer strategies will lose their effectiveness and the poor and the middle class will be on the same team because they will both have lost everything.</p>
<p>As most of you know, I have been screaming from the roof tops that the “Russians are coming, the Russians are coming”, in reference to a bilateral agreement signed between the Russian military and FEMA. Well, the Russians are not coming, they are here and so are the Chinese. As most of you also know the Russians are Chinese have threatened to nuke the United States over Iran and Syria in the past several months. Yet, this administration thinks it is a good idea to include the Russians and Chinese in participating in highly secure operations with profound national security implications in such drills as Grid EX II and the upcoming  RIMPAC war games which we used to use to fight against the imaginary Chinese and Russian forces. This is insanity, however, in athletic parlance, one side conducted a trade and is now receiving the services of their once arch-rival.</p>
<p>The sides of the coming civil war looks like this. On one side, we find the evil empire consisting of the elite, their government puppets, the DHS the Chinese, the Russians and perhaps the military. The other side, for the moment consists of the middle class and now the poor as they move towards having their entitlements incrementally taken away. Unless the military and the police can be swayed to the side of the people, the people are going to lose badly.</p>
<p>There is one big prize and its allegiance has not yet been determined and that is the American military and it is a game changer.</p>
<h2>Carving Up the Military Like a Thanksgiving Turkey</h2>
<p>Obama is purging the military like no president has ever done. Bush fired two Generals. Obama has fired hundreds of command level officers. Why? Because the military leadership is the key to the coming civil war. Who will the military support? Will the military support an out of control administration who would use foreign military assets against the people? Or, will they support the people that they are sworn to defend?</p>
<p>Obama has the Russians and the Chinese military coming into the country because our military cannot be trusted to do what needs to be done when the economic crash occurs. They are needed to confiscate the guns. Obama knows that the military is conditioned to protect the people. He is hoping that he can change the entire structure of the military and thus, change its mission through changing its leadership.</p>
<p>I personally do not think Obama can change the rank and file of the military. I think he can only have a minimal effect on the leadership of the military. If Obama’s purge of the military is anything but for the purpose of commandeering its services for the upcoming civil war, I would really like to hear another explanation, because, for the life of me, I cannot see another purpose to Obama’s house cleaning of the military. .</p>
<p>Obama needs to be impeached and convicted for treason.</p>

</div>
<p>It was the silence that made this voyage different from all of those before it.</p>
<p>Not the absence of sound, exactly.</p>
<p>The wind still whipped the sails and whistled in the rigging. The waves still sloshed against the fibreglass hull.</p>
<p>And there were plenty of other noises: muffled thuds and bumps and scrapes as the boat knocked against pieces of debris.</p>
<p>What was missing was the cries of the seabirds which, on all previous similar voyages, had surrounded the boat.</p>
<p>The birds were missing because the fish were missing.</p>
<p>Exactly 10 years before, when Newcastle yachtsman Ivan Macfadyen had sailed exactly the same course from Melbourne to Osaka, all he’d had to do to catch a fish from the ocean between Brisbane and Japan was throw out a baited line.</p>
<p><em>“There was not one of the 28 days on that portion of the trip when we didn’t catch a good-sized fish to cook up and eat with some rice,”</em> Macfadyen recalled.</p>
<p>But this time, on that whole long leg of sea journey, the total catch was two.</p>
<p>No fish. No birds. Hardly a sign of life at all.</p>
<p><em>“In years gone by I’d gotten used to all the birds and their noises,”</em> he said.</p>
<p><em>“They’d be following the boat, sometimes resting on the mast before taking off again. You’d see flocks of them wheeling over the surface of the sea in the distance, feeding on pilchards.”</em></p>
<p>But in March and April this year, only silence and desolation surrounded his boat, Funnel Web, as it sped across the surface of a haunted ocean.</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="Ivan Macfadyen aboard the Funnel Web." src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Ivan_Macfadyen.jpg" width="300" height="232" /></p>
<div><strong>Ivan Macfadyen aboard the Funnel Web.</strong></div>
</div>
<p>North of the equator, up above New Guinea, the ocean-racers saw a big fishing boat working a reef in the distance.</p>
<p><em>“All day it was there, trawling back and forth. It was a big ship, like a mother-ship,”</em>he said.</p>
<p>And all night it worked too, under bright floodlights. And in the morning Macfadyen was awoken by his crewman calling out, urgently, that the ship had launched a speedboat.</p>
<p><em>“Obviously I was worried. We were unarmed and pirates are a real worry in those waters. I thought, if these guys had weapons then we were in deep trouble.”</em></p>
<p>But they weren’t pirates, not in the conventional sense, at least. The speedboat came alongside and the Melanesian men aboard offered gifts of fruit and jars of jam and preserves.</p>
<p><em>“And they gave us five big sugar-bags full of fish,”</em> he said.</p>
<p><em>“They were good, big fish, of all kinds. Some were fresh, but others had obviously been in the sun for a while.</em></p>
<p><em>“We told them there was no way we could possibly use all those fish. There were just two of us, with no real place to store or keep them. They just shrugged and told us to tip them overboard. That’s what they would have done with them anyway, they said.</em></p>
<p><em>“They told us that his was just a small fraction of one day’s by-catch. That they were only interested in tuna and to them, everything else was rubbish. It was all killed, all dumped. They just trawled that reef day and night and stripped it of every living thing.”</em></p>
<p>Macfadyen felt sick to his heart. That was one fishing boat among countless more working unseen beyond the horizon, many of them doing exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>No wonder the sea was dead. No wonder his baited lines caught nothing. There was nothing to catch.</p>
<p>If that sounds depressing, it only got worse.</p>
<p>The next leg of the long voyage was from Osaka to San Francisco and for most of that trip the desolation was tinged with nauseous horror and a degree of fear.</p>
<p><em>“After we left Japan, it felt as if the ocean itself was dead,”</em> Macfadyen said.</p>
<p><em>“We hardly saw any living things. We saw one whale, sort of rolling helplessly on the surface with what looked like a big tumour on its head. It was pretty sickening.</em></p>
<p><em>“I’ve done a lot of miles on the ocean in my life and I’m used to seeing turtles, dolphins, sharks and big flurries of feeding birds. But this time, for 3000 nautical miles there was nothing alive to be seen.”</em></p>
<p>In place of the missing life was garbage in astounding volumes.</p>
<p><em>“Part of it was the aftermath of the tsunami that hit Japan a couple of years ago. The wave came in over the land, picked up an unbelievable load of stuff and carried it out to sea. And it’s still out there, everywhere you look.”</em></p>
<p>Ivan’s brother, Glenn, who boarded at Hawaii for the run into the United States, marvelled at the “thousands on thousands” of yellow plastic buoys. The huge tangles of synthetic rope, fishing lines and nets. Pieces of polystyrene foam by the million. And slicks of oil and petrol, everywhere.</p>
<p>Countless hundreds of wooden power poles are out there, snapped off by the killer wave and still trailing their wires in the middle of the sea.</p>
<p><em>“In years gone by, when you were becalmed by lack of wind, you’d just start your engine and motor on,”</em> Ivan said.</p>
<p>Not this time.</p>
<p><em>“In a lot of places we couldn’t start our motor for fear of entangling the propeller in the mass of pieces of rope and cable. That’s an unheard of situation, out in the ocean.</em></p>
<p><em>“If we did decide to motor we couldn’t do it at night, only in the daytime with a lookout on the bow, watching for rubbish.</em></p>
<p><em>“On the bow, in the waters above Hawaii, you could see right down into the depths. I could see that the debris isn’t just on the surface, it’s all the way down. And it’s all sizes, from a soft-drink bottle to pieces the size of a big car or truck.</em></p>
<p><em>“We saw a factory chimney sticking out of the water, with some kind of boiler thing still attached below the surface. We saw a big container-type thing, just rolling over and over on the waves.</em></p>
<p><em>“We were weaving around these pieces of debris. It was like sailing through a garbage tip.</em></p>
<p><em>“Below decks you were constantly hearing things hitting against the hull, and you were constantly afraid of hitting something really big. As it was, the hull was scratched and dented all over the place from bits and pieces we never saw.”</em></p>
<p>Plastic was ubiquitous. Bottles, bags and every kind of throwaway domestic item you can imagine, from broken chairs to dustpans, toys and utensils.</p>
<p>And something else. The boat’s vivid yellow paint job, never faded by sun or sea in years gone past, reacted with something in the water off Japan, losing its sheen in a strange and unprecedented way.</p>
<p>Back in Newcastle, Ivan Macfadyen is still coming to terms with the shock and horror of the voyage.</p>
<p><em>“The ocean is broken,”</em> he said, shaking his head in stunned disbelief.</p>
<p>Recognising the problem is vast, and that no organisations or governments appear to have a particular interest in doing anything about it, Macfadyen is looking for ideas.</p>
<p>He plans to lobby government ministers, hoping they might help.</p>
<p>More immediately, he will approach the organisers of Australia’s major ocean races, trying to enlist yachties into an international scheme that uses volunteer yachtsmen to monitor debris and marine life.</p>
<p>Macfadyen signed up to this scheme while he was in the US, responding to an approach by US academics who asked yachties to fill in daily survey forms and collect samples for radiation testing – a significant concern in the wake of the tsunami and consequent nuclear power station failure in Japan.</p>
<p><em>“I asked them why don’t we push for a fleet to go and clean up the mess,”</em> he said.</p>
<p><em>“But they said they’d calculated that the environmental damage from burning the fuel to do that job would be worse than just leaving the debris there.”</em></p>

</div>
<p>Are Americans ready to accept a police state? Are pastors and Christians ready to accept a police state? Are Republicans and conservatives ready to accept a police state? Are Democrats and liberals ready to accept a police state? Are there truly enough people left in this country who even understand what a police state is, and if they do, would they really support it?</p>
<p>I can hear many readers shouting, “No!” But I truly wonder just how many Americans have already accepted the police state in their hearts and minds. It is absolutely true that before despots and tyrants can put shackles around men’s necks, they must first put them around men’s hearts. So, just how many of the American people are walking around every day with shackles already around their hearts? How many pastors mount the pulpits with shackles around their hearts? How many teachers enter the classroom with shackles around their hearts? How many State lawmakers walk into their various capitols with shackles around their hearts? How many police officers get into their squad cars with shackles around their hearts? How many military personnel put on their uniforms with shackles around their hearts?</p>
<p>Those of us who are passionate about the freedom fight spend a lot of time discussing and debating the nuances of how best to protect liberty. Except for a precious few, our State governors, attorney generals, legislators, senators, mayors, county commissioners, city councilmen, etc., are doing a fantastically lousy job of honoring their oaths to the Constitution and to the principles contained in our Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights. Except for a precious few, our pastors, deacons, elders, and church leaders are doing a fantastically lousy job of defending freedom principles. Except for a precious few, our civic and business leaders are doing a fantastically lousy job of defending liberty. And needless to say, you could put the people on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., who are even doing diddly-squat about preserving liberty into an old-fashioned phone booth.</p>
<p>Republicans? Most of them have never seen a bill that expands the police state at home and foreign wars abroad that they did not absolutely love. Democrats? Most of them have never seen a bill that expanded government (any government) that they did not absolutely love. Yes, yes, I know that there are a few&#8211;a precious few&#8211;exceptions to the above, but not many.</p>
<p>But are the American people truly ready to accept a police state? A recent report at InfoWars.com is quite shocking to those of us who tend to believe that most of our fellow Americans would recoil at the thought of an open police state.</p>
<p>Reporting for InfoWars.com, Paul Joseph Watson writes, “After illustrating their enthusiasm for repealing the Bill of Rights, a video shows Americans happily signing a petition to support a ‘Nazi-style Orwellian police state,’ in what easily represents the most shocking footage of its kind to date.</p>
<p>“Citing issues with how the government shutdown has impacted the ability of the police to ‘keep the community safe,’ [Mark] Dice tells San Diegans that there is a need to ‘increase the Orwellian system.’</p>
<p>“‘Not a problem,’ responds one man as he signs the petition.</p>
<p>“‘We just want to model it after the Nazi Germany system to keep people safe and secure,’ Dice tells another individual.</p>
<p>“After signing the petition to ‘implement the Orwellian police state,’ another man responds, ‘You find the pot of money though,’ apparently more concerned about how much a Nazi-style police state would cost than its actual consequences.</p>
<p>“‘They’re trying to cut the budget by 20 per cent so we just want to make sure that we can model the police state after the Nazi Germany system,’ Dice tells another couple who sign the petition, before adding, ‘Thanks for supporting the police state.’</p>
<p>“‘We’re going to model it after the Nazi Germany-style police state,’ Dice clearly tells another man who signs the petition.</p>
<p>“‘We need this Orwellian-style system to keep everybody safe,’ Dice tells a woman as she is signing the petition, to which she responds, ‘Yeah.’”</p>
<p>See Watson’s report at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.infowars.com%2Famericans-sign-petition-to-support-nazi-style-orwellian-police-state%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFE7WKkBT9weJYLTOur4TzFnndsTA" target="_blank">Americans Sign Petition to Support “Nazi-Style Orwellian Police State”</a></p>
<p>So, how many of your friends, relatives, co-workers, neighbors, fellow club members, fellow pastors, and fellow church members would be willing to sign such a petition as mentioned above? Probably more than you would think. Why don’t you use Mark Dice’s technique and go stand with a petition on a street corner in your town or on a sidewalk outside the entrance of your church and find out? But be prepared for a shock. It is not just San Diegans that are already wearing the shackles around their hearts.</p>
<p>Those of us in the liberty movement are knocking our brains out trying to devise the best strategy to preserve the vestiges of freedom that are left in this country. The assaults against our liberties are ubiquitous&#8211;and so are the battlefronts upon which our fellow freedom-fighters are tirelessly and relentlessly defending the hill. Thank God for every one of them! I may or may not agree with each strategy or the people who come up with them, but if they are in the liberty fight, they are my brothers and compatriots.</p>
<p>But it is time for us to ask ourselves, are we living in a country in which a sizeable percentage of people do not care about, and may actually not WANT, liberty? Are we living in a country in which a sizeable percentage of people have already accepted the shackles of tyranny around their hearts?</p>
<p>I’m talking about Democrats and Republicans; Christians and unbelievers; pastors and pagans; liberals and conservatives; whites and blacks; educated and illiterate; rich and poor; men and women; northerners and southerners; easterners and westerners; military and civilians. How many are already wearing the shackles of tyranny around their hearts? I’m afraid far more than most of us want to admit.</p>
<p>At this point, I must make the following observation: if you are living in a State that does not recognize your right to keep and BEAR arms, if you live in a State that significantly impedes your right to possess and CARRY arms, if you live in a State that is unfriendly to the Second Amendment, you are living in a State in which a majority of lawmakers and citizens are already wearing the tyrant’s yoke around their hearts&#8211;and they want you to wear it, too.  And if you live in a large metropolitan city anywhere, you are living in one of liberty’s most inhospitable and hostile places. In all candor, one of the chief reasons why my family and I moved to a small town in a rural State (the Flathead Valley of Montana) is because of what I’m talking about right now.</p>
<p>For more information on our move to Montana, please go to this web page:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fchuckbaldwinlive.com%2FLinks%2FNewsLinks.aspx%3FCategory%3DBaldwins%25E2%2580%2599%2520Move%2520to%2520Montana&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9LgkjdkT5jEUfeTMrtc9rQTn_jQ" target="_blank">Baldwins’ Move To Montana</a></p>
<p>I realize that we have our share of big-government weenies here in Montana, too. I know we have a bunch of politicians and people who carry the shackles of tyranny around their hearts. I won’t argue that. But I also know that if police agencies in this area attempted a military lockdown such as took place in Boston after the marathon bombings, they would start a modern-day revolution. I KNOW that the majority of people in the Flathead Valley would never submit to such a police state. I also believe that the vast majority of law enforcement officers in this area would never attempt to enact such a police state.</p>
<p>As an example, according to published reports, the average home in the State of Montana has 27 firearms in it. Yes, you read it right: 27. I dare say that the average pickup truck in Montana has more guns in it than the average house in just about any other State.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Thomas Jefferson was right: big cities are the “bane” of freedom. And those states that are controlled by big cities are also a major culprit in the demise of liberty.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Boston’s Gun Bible (BGB) ranked the states in order of their recognition of the right to keep and bear arms. According to BGB, the freest states are:</p>
<p>1. Vermont<br />
2. Idaho and Kentucky (tie)<br />
3. Louisiana and Alaska (tie)<br />
4. Wyoming<br />
5. Montana</p>
<p>And, again, according to BGB, the least free states are:</p>
<p>1. New Jersey<br />
2. Illinois<br />
3. Hawaii<br />
4. Massachusetts<br />
5. New York</p>
<p>Now, I would personally argue BGB’s ranking of Montana as number 5 in the list of freest states&#8211;especially when it comes to the Second Amendment. Regardless, notice the absence of the dominance of big-cities within the list of freest states, contrasted with the obvious dominance of big-cities within the list of least free states. In the list of freest states, only Kentucky and Louisiana have a metro area with over one million population. And in the case of Vermont, Idaho, Alaska, Wyoming, and Montana, the State with the largest population is Idaho with just over 1.5 million&#8211;in the ENTIRE STATE. The conclusion should be obvious: big cities equal less freedom; rural states equal more freedom.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this divergence of philosophy and the willingness or unwillingness of people in big city states and rural states to either accept or reject tyranny is a boiling pot that at some point is going to spill over onto the eye of the stove. Notice that Mr. Dice’s petition was asked of people in one of America’s largest population centers: San Diego, California. Take that same petition to the streets of Kalispell, Montana; Coeur d’Alene, Idaho; Cheyenne, Wyoming; or Wasilla, Alaska; and the response would be MUCH different.</p>
<p>I don’t believe tyranny will come to America all at once; it will come piecemeal, city by city, State by State, and region by region. And liberty will be preserved the same way.</p>
<p>So, are Americans ready to accept a police state? It all depends on where you live.</p>
<p>P.S. This weekend, selected cities across the country will be privileged to see the premiere screening of James Jaeger’s fantastic new movie, “MOLON LABE: How The Second Amendment Guarantees America’s Freedom.” The film features such notable freedomists as Pat Buchanan, Ron Paul, Larry Pratt, G. Edward Griffin, Alex Jones, and, yes, yours truly&#8211;along with several others. It is terrific film. The people of the Flathead Valley in Montana are fortunate to be able to attend this premiere showing at the Mountain Cinema 4 theaters in Whitefish, Montana, at 11am Mountain Time, this Saturday, October 26. If you live within driving distance, you are invited to attend this premiere screening. DVDs of the film will be available at the showing.</p>
<p>If you are not able to go see MOLON LABE this weekend and would like to order the DVD of this new film, you may do so NOW. Order the MOLON LABE DVD here:</p>

<p>The philosophical condemnation of the supremacy in individual liberty verses the reigning doctrine of collective dominance, is a primary cause for the destruction of Western Civilization principles. Rene Descartes preferred to do his radical doubt thinking in solitude. In today’s society, thinking is about as foreign as rational behavior. In order to understand the timeless values and precepts that fostered the underpinnings of our Western thought and heritage, the significance of Descartes needs a close examination.</p>
<p>Jorn K. Bramann, PhD in The Educating Rita Workbook is the source reference for the <a href="http://facultyfiles.frostburg.edu/phil/forum/Descartes.htm">Descartes: The Solitary Self</a> essay. This excellent treatise deserves your full attention.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are two cultural legacies of lasting importance that Descartes’ radical separation of the mind from the physical world has left—two philosophical conceptions of reality that found expression in how Europeans related to their environment, and how they perceived their over-all existence in the world.</p>
<p>The one legacy fastens on the absolute sovereignty of the mind vis-à-vis everything that is not mind. While the external world, including the thinker&#8217;s body, is subject to the laws of physics and other external contingencies, the mind is not. I, being pure mind, enjoy a supreme degree of independence from my body and everything physical.</p>
<p>The radical separation of mind and body&#8211;and of the mental and the physical in general&#8211;is known as &#8220;Cartesian Dualism.&#8221; And by attributing to the mind something like sovereignty over the external physical world, it has prepared the way for a distinctly modern conception and experience of reality, a conception which replaced older ways of seeing the world in drastic ways.</p>
<p>The other important legacy that originates with Descartes’ radical separation of the mind from everything physical is the inherently solipsistic individualism that time and again emerged in the course of modern European philosophy. Solipsism is the extremist philosophical theory that I am the only being that exists. This theory is invariably perceived as either comical or crazy by anyone who discusses it, and most philosophers have assumed that there are convincing reasons for dismissing it without much ado. The way Descartes sets up and explains his procedure of radical doubt, however, makes it impossible to avoid the conclusion that the doubting self may indeed be the only being that exists. In spite of all efforts to refute it, Cartesianism remains haunted by the ghost of Solipsism . . . The decisive point of Cartesian doubt is the contention that I cannot go outside of myself, as it were, to check whether what I see is real or not. I am always and irremediably inside my mind, and that always keeps alive the theoretical possibility of the truth of Solipsism.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The &#8220;ME&#8221; culture seems to be the social reflection of adopting a solipsist personal mindset. The unreality in which so many zombies live their existence, seems to be the extreme of the only perception of knowing within yourself. When Tocqueville stated his famous comment that &#8220;<em>Americans are Cartesians without having read Descartes</em>&#8220;, we get an insight into the significance that Descartes had on the Enlightenment and the emerging scientific age.</p>
<p>In another segment from <a href="http://faculty.frostburg.edu/phil/forum/Tocqueville.htm">The Educating Rita Workbook</a>, Doctor Bramann cites the reasons why Americans function within the social framework that came out of a philosophical departure from the Old Europe.</p>
<blockquote><p>The social condition that makes Americans natural Cartesians are described by de Tocqueville as follows:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;In the midst of the continual movement which agitates a democratic community, the tie which unites one generation to another is relaxed or broken; every man readily loses the trace of the ideas of his forefathers or takes no care about them.</em></p>
<p><em>Nor can men living in this state of society derive their belief from the opinions of the class to which they belong; for, so to speak, there are no longer any classes, or those which still exist are composed of such mobile elements, that their body can never exercise a real control over its members.</em></p>
<p><em>As to the influence which the intelligence of one man has on that of another, it must necessarily be very limited in a country where the citizens, placed on a footing of a general similitude, are all closely seen by each other; and where, as no signs of incontestable greatness or superiority are perceived in any one of them, they are constantly brought back to their own reason as the most obvious and proximate source of truth.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Relying on and coming back to your own reason seems to be relegated to past generations. Is the Descartes doctrine relevant in the technocratic and transnational, globalist interdependent and digital connected world of today and still the compelling intellectual system? Well, this begs the question of an analysis about current worldly conditions and the true criteria and standards that any successful society must adopt.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://theundyingsoul.com/science-and-religion/science-vs-religion-rene-descartes-and-the-cause-of-spiritual-decline/">The Underlying Soul</a>, by Stephen Iacoboni, MD writes at <a href="http://theundyingsoul.com/science-and-religion/science-vs-religion-rene-descartes-and-the-cause-of-spiritual-decline/">Science vs Religion: Rene Descartes and the Cause of Spiritual Decline</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Before Descartes, mind, body and soul were one — as described so eloquently by the greatest of the scholastics, Aquinas himself. The Cartesian legacy, which had driven Europe to its greatest heights of world exploration, colonization, and conquest, paradoxically has left the West in decline. Europe now is more a museum rather than anything resembling a world power.</p>
<p>Why? Because Descartes’ famous statement says that thought precedes self-awareness, i.e., soul. But, modern science now tells us that thought is simply a bodily function of the cerebral cortex. As such, there is no room in the medical model for Descartes’ separated soul to play any real role in our lives. Thus, the legacy of Descartes, after four centuries of material success, is spiritual collapse. For the first time in the history of Western civilization, many now believe <em>we are soulless</em>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That is the very point that needs to be deconstructed. The operative benchmark is not the fashionable belief that perception is everything. The trends and flows of popular culture are not superior to constraints of nature and the laws of the universe. A soulless society cannot respect the dignity of the individual or protect the natural rights of persons. Yet, the vast achievements of raising people out of poverty, social despair and private isolation are a central part of the legacy of Western Civilization.</p>
<p>When the Bramann assessment begins with the viewpoint:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Individualism is one of the hallmarks of Western philosophy and civilization. No other intellectual tradition has been as intensively (some would say: excessively) preoccupied with singling out and defining the individual self than Western philosophy, and no other polity has made the presumed rights and prerogatives of the individual as central a concern as Western societies. Individualism is as defining a characteristic of our present civilization as capitalism, materialism, technology, and global expansion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He is really validating and concluding that Descartes helped set into motion a new wave of thinking that broke from the past and liberated the mind and practical accomplishment capacities of what is pejoratively called progress.</p>
<p>Is the triumph of the will a feat of institutional communal conscience? On the other hand, are the vast majority of initiative steps forward a product of individual inspiration and creative insights?</p>
<p>Rene Descartes did not originate the argument that the individuals are their own sole and ultimate arbitrator of perceiving reality, but he did contribute a singular vision that penetrated into the social fabric of Europe and America. Western political thought has always been a depository of philosophical building blocks that rest upon the pillars of the Greek notion of democratic rights, privileges and responsibilities.</p>
<p>The adoption of Roman edicts and precepts evolved into the admiralty law of equity relativism that passes today for jurisprudence. To the extent, that Descartes separated the soul from any real role in our lives, would not negate the factual truth that our soul is the essential being of our personhood and existence.</p>
<p>Civilization is not possible without a firm acceptance that individuals possess, by their very nature, <a href="http://famguardian.org/Subjects/Politics/ThomasJefferson/jeff0100.htm">Inalienable Rights</a> as understood by Thomas Jefferson. John Locke influenced Jefferson and his prospective can be traced back to <a href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~freeman/courses/phil100/09.%20Descartes%20Meditations.pdf">Descartes</a>’ assertion that all individuals have the &#8220;natural light of reason.&#8221; Descartes’ belief that the world is essentially rational and comprehensible is certainly being tested by current world events. However, the awful actions that disrespect citizens have a direct correlation to the way that governments, corporatists and institutions mistreat human life.</p>
<p>The refuge of one’s own mind may well be the last assertion of your own self worth and intrinsic value. With all the mental assaults and psyops targeting your intellect, the day of an independent and individualistic human species may well come to an end. At that point, the collective soul of humanity dies as well.</p>
<p>Those rugged individuals that Tocqueville observed in 19th century America would be in shock and horror to see the lack of critical thinking in this anti-intellectual society. For his part, do not blame Descartes, he knew who he was.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/snowdendrawing3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/snowdendrawing2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>In the midst of its short summer, Moscow is balmy and relaxed.  Sidewalks brim with tables and merry customers, even traffic jams are less severe due to holiday season. The only danger for men is the girls’ dresses, they are precariously short.</p>
<p>In a few days, perhaps even tomorrow, the charms and  dangers of the city will be available to Edward Snowden, who is about to receive a refugee ID,  allowing him to roam freely the whole length and breadth of Russia and to socialise with its folk.</p>
<p>It will be a nice change from Sheremetyevo International Airport, where he was marooned for quite a while. The airport is vast; some unfortunates, mainly paperless refugees, live in its transit area for ten years or more. For a while, it was felt that our hero would remain stuck forever in limbo. The Russians and the intrepid Snowden sat on the fence, getting used to each other while keeping their distance. At long last, the ice was broken.  Snowden had gotten to meet with  representatives of the Russian public: a few members of Parliament (called Duma, in Russian), some human rights folks, leading lawyers.</p>
<p>He reminded them that he “had the capability without any warrant to search for, seize, and read your communications… [and] change people’s fates”. He invoked the US Constitution transgressed by the spooks, for the Constitution “forbids such systems of massive, pervasive surveillance”. He rightly rejected the legal ruse of Obama’s secret courts, for no secrecy can purify the impure. He recalled the Nuremberg ruling: &#8220;Individual citizens have the duty to violate domestic laws to prevent crimes against peace and humanity from occurring.&#8221; And this system of total surveillance is indeed  a crime against humanity, the cornerstone of the Iron Heel regime they plan to establish on the planet. When his declaration was interrupted by the airport&#8217;s routine announcements over the loudspeaker, he charmingly smiled and said “I’ve heard it so many times during the last week”.</p>
<p>The Russians loved him; the whole attitude to Snowden changed for better, as I expected when <a href="http://www.kp.ru/daily/26100/2997749/">I called</a> for this meeting on the pages of the leading Russian newspaper, the KP (Komsomolskaya Pravda). Now we&#8217;ve learned that the Russians have decided to issue him a refugee ID and grant him freedom of movement.</p>
<p><strong>Why did they hesitate for so long?</strong></p>
<p>Snowden is an American, and the Americans, like the British, are quite prejudiced against Russia, their common Cold War enemy. For them, it is the country of the Gulag and the KGB. Though both menaces vanished decades ago, traditions die hard, if at all. Even the Gulag and the KGB were only a modernised version of the Tsar, knout and serfdom horror of the 19th century, to be eventually superseded by the Brutal New Russian Mafia State as updated by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/mafia-state-luke-harding">Luke Harding</a>. For an average American, the prospect of befriending Russia is nigh unto impossible. Even more so for an American who served in the CIA and NSA, as Snowden did. He felt that by embracing Russia he would lose his whistle-blower status and be regarded as an enemy agent, a totally different kettle of fish.</p>
<p>This was the case for Julian Assange, as well.  When it was proposed that the head of Wikileaks flee to Russia (it was technically possible), he procrastinated, dragged his feet and remained in England,  unable, in the end, to cross the great East/West divide.</p>
<p>Snowden was not seeking limelight, quite the opposite!  He wished to stop the crimes being committed by No Such Agency in the name of American people, no more, no less.  He hoped to become a new Deep Throat, whose identity would never be revealed.  His first profound revelations were made by correspondence; he flew to Hong Kong as he was familiar with the place, spoke fluent Chinese, and planned to return home to Hawaii. It appears  that the Guardian Newspaper pushed him into revealing his identity. Even then he thought himself safe, for Hong Kong is under Chinese sovereignty, and China is a mighty state, not an easy pushover.</p>
<p>The Chinese used Snowden’s revelations to defuse American accusations of electronic espionage, but they weren’t going to spoil relations with the US for his sake – the hot potato was tossed.  As a final courtesy they gave him 24 hours warning of his impending arrest. He had to flee, and he boarded the Aeroflot flight to Moscow in company of charming English lady, a Wikileaks executive Sarah Harrison.</p>
<p>Snowden landed in Moscow, but he never considered taking refuge in Russia. For him, this was just a transit point to a neutral country, be it Iceland or Venezuela, some part of the West. He planned to fly to Havana and change planes there for Caracas. He did not take into account the length to which the US Deep State would go to seize and punish him.</p>
<p>At first, the Americans put enormous pressure on Cuba to refuse transit for Snowden. They threatened Cuba with invasion and blockade, and Castro asked Snowden to look for another route. No airline but Aeroflot would fly Snowden out of Russia, and Aeroflot flies via Havana only. So the first plan got unstuck.</p>
<p>The gas summit in Moscow offered another opportunity for escape: the summit was attended by the presidents of Bolivia and Venezuela, both came with their private planes able to make the long flight. Bolivian president Evo Morales had left Moscow first; his plane was forced down and searched, setting a historical precedent. This served as a warning to the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro; he flew away from Moscow Snowden-less.</p>
<p>This was an important discovery for Ed Snowden: he learned by this experience that there is just one country on the planet that is outside of the US grasp. Just one country that is a real alternative to the Empire; the only country Navy Seals are not likely to raid nor Obama drones to bomb, the only country whose planes can’t be scrambled and searched. He understood that Moscow is the only safe place on the globe for an identified enemy of the Empire. Now he was ready to contact the Russians;  he resumed his temporary refuge request, which will probably be granted.</p>
<p>The Russians also hesitated. They were not keen on angering the US, they were aware that Snowden did not intend to come to them and just happened to get stuck in transit. He was a hot potato, and many people were convinced it&#8217;s better to follow the Chinese example and toss him.</p>
<p>The US Lobby pulled out all the stops trying to have him extradited. There were human rights activists and NGO members in the employ of the US State Department. Such people and organisations are promoted by the Americans, a Fifth Column of sorts. Lyudmila Alexeeva is a leading Russian activist of this kind; she was an anti-Soviet dissident, acquired US citizenship, came back to Russia and resumed her fight for human rights and against the Russian state. She is on record as saying that Snowden is a traitor to the service, neither a whistle-blower nor a human rights defender. He should be surrendered to the US, she averred. Other notorious dissidents and fighters against Putin&#8217;s regime agreed with her, unmasking their true colours.</p>
<p>Some <em>siloviki</em> were also against Snowden. These are members and ex-members of Russian intelligence community, who embraced the concept of convergence of security services and collaborated with the Americans and other services, notably the Israelis. They said that loyalty to one&#8217;s service is the most important virtue, and a traitor can&#8217;t be trusted. They pooh-poohed Snowden’s revelations saying they had known it all along. They said he is not worth quarrelling with Washington about. This  was also the line of Konstantin Remchukov, an important Russian media lord, the owner of <em>Nezavisimaya Gazeta</em>, who added that Snowden was a Chinese spy.</p>
<p>And finally there were conspiracy freaks, who said that Snowden is a Trojan Horse, sent to pry open Russian secrets. He was actually a CIA double agent, they said. No, he was an agent of Mossad, others argued. Return him to the US, they asserted. This bottom line has exposed many American agents, whether faux human rights defenders or equally false <em>siloviki</em>, security personnel.</p>
<p>Among supporters of Snowden in Russia, there was my friend, the poet Eduard Limonov, who called Snowden the harbinger of Unipolar World collapse. My newspaper <a href="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/user/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/AppData/Local/Temp/KP.ru">KP</a> supported the cause as well. The state-owned TV took a cautious approach, and was rather dismissive of Snowden’s discoveries.</p>
<p>President Putin, too, played a cautious game. Initially, he stopped talk of surrendering Snowden with a laconic statement: «Russia never ever extradites anybody to any state». Then he offered Snowden refuge on condition that he would not act against the US. This is a usual condition for a political refuge. He added that probably Snowden would not accept it as he wants to continue his struggle “just like Professor Sakharov”, a renown dissident of Soviet days. He also tried to dissuade America from pursuing Snowden, comparing this pursuit with “shearing a piglet”, producing more screams than wool. This cautious game paid well: Snowden accepted his precondition and applied for temporary refuge until the road to Latin America opens up for him, while the President saved face and did his best to avoid quarrelling with the US and with the mighty pro-American lobby in Moscow. I should say that despite his autocratic macho image, Putin does not control free Russian media, which are usually owned by pro-Western media lords. His positions in the national discourse get limited exposure.</p>
<p>The Russian leader was not confrontational. He does not look for trouble, as a rule. He comes off as rather a cautious, prudent, conservative ruler. He would probably prefer that Snowden fly away, especially as Snowden, an American patriot, would not share his stolen crown jewels with the Russians. His granting permission for Snowden to meet with the Russian public was withheld for a long while. However, during this period, the US added many more names to the secret Magnitsky List of Russians whose properties and accounts were to be snatched (“frozen” is the technical term) by the US and its allies. Members of Congress freely vituperated against Putin and referred to Russia in abusive terms. Just wait &#8212; Obama will call Putin tonight and he will send Snowden packing, said the White House spokesman. Meanwhile, the US continued its build-up against Syria in the Middle East, and Israel bombed Syrian positions, presumably with American support. Instead of showing any consideration, Obama tried to bully Putin. This was the wrong tactic, and it backfired.</p>
<p>At the same time, Russia carried out a sudden check of its military preparedness, apparently keeping all options open. This great country is not looking for trouble, but it does not shrink from it either. Snowden is safe here in Moscow, where nobody can harm him, so he will be able to tell the world about the crimes against humanity committed by the American secret services. And Moscow is a great place to be, especially in summer.</p>

			<p><strong>NYT: &#8220;The Obama administration made common cause with the House Republican leadership&#8221;</strong></p>
<div><img itemprop="contentUrl representativeOfPage" alt="Michele Bachmann" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/4/1325698548239/bachmann_quitting.jpg" width="460" height="276" /><em><br />
One of the most vocal supporters of the Obama White House&#8217;s position on yesterday&#8217;s NSA debate: GOP Congresswoman Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. </em></p>
</div>
<div id="article-body-blocks">
<p>One of the worst myths Democratic partisans love to tell themselves &#8211; and everyone else &#8211; is that the GOP refuses to support President Obama no matter what he does. Like its close cousin &#8211; the massively deceitful inside-DC grievance that the two parties refuse to cooperate on anything &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to overstate how false this Democratic myth is. When it comes to foreign policy, war, assassinations, drones, surveillance, secrecy, and civil liberties, President Obama&#8217;s most stalwart, enthusiastic defenders are often found among the most radical precincts of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>The rabidly pro-war and anti-Muslim GOP former Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Peter King, has <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/06/10/obama_defender_rep_peter_king/">repeatedly lavished Obama with all sorts of praise</a> and support for his policies in those areas. The Obama White House frequently <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2010/07/democrats-obama-afghanistan-war-/1">needs, and receives</a>, large amounts of GOP Congressional support to have <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll036.xml">its measures enacted</a> or bills its dislikes defeated. The Obama DOJ <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/04/03/the_obama_doj_and_strip_searches/">often prevails before the US Supreme Court</a> solely because the Roberts/Scalia/Thomas faction adopts its view while the Ginsburg/Sotomayor/Breyer faction rejects it (as happened in February when the Court, by a 5-4 ruling, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/11-1025">dismissed a lawsuit</a> brought by Amnesty and the ACLU which argued that the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on NSA" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nsa">NSA</a>&#8216;s domestic warrantless eavesdropping activities violate the Fourth Amendment; the Roberts/Scalia wing accepted the Obama DOJ&#8217;s argument that the plaintiffs lack standing to sue because the NSA successfully conceals the identity of which Americans are subjected to the surveillance). As Wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/02/scotus-surveillance-challenge/">put it at the time about that NSA ruling</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 5-4 decision by Justice Samuel Alito was a clear victory for the President Barack Obama administration, which like its predecessor, argued that government wiretapping laws cannot be challenged in court.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The extraordinary events that took place in the House of Representatives yesterday are perhaps the most vivid illustration yet of this dynamic, and it independently reveals several other important trends. The House voted on an <a href="http://amash.house.gov/speech/amash-nsa-amendment-fact-sheet">amendment sponsored by Justin Amash</a>, the young Michigan lawyer elected in 2010 as a Tea Party candidate, and co-sponsored by John Conyers, the 24-term senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. The amendment was simple. It would de-fund one single NSA program: the agency&#8217;s bulk collection of the telephone records of all Americans that we <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order">first revealed in this space, back on June 6</a>. It accomplished this &#8220;by requiring the FISA court under Sec. 215 [of the Patriot Act] to order the production of records that pertain <em>only to a person under investigation</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p>The amendment yesterday was defeated. But it <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll412.xml">lost by only 12 votes: 205-217</a>. Given that the amendment sought to de-fund a major domestic surveillance program of the NSA, the very close vote was nothing short of shocking. In fact, in the post-9/11 world, amendments like this, which directly challenge the Surveillance and National Security States, almost never get votes at all. That the GOP House Leadership was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/22/justin-amash-nsa-surveillance_n_3637462.html?utm_hp_ref=politics">forced to allow it to reach the floor</a> was a sign of how much things have changed over the last seven weeks.</p>
<p>More significant than the closeness of the vote was its breakdown. A majority of House Democrats supported the Amash/Conyers amendment, while a majority of Republicans voted against it:</p>
<div><img alt="roll call" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/25/1374738406126/rollcall.png" width="460" height="151" /></p>
</div>
<p>The full roll call vote is <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll412.xml">here</a>. House Speaker John Boehner saved the Obama White House by voting against it and ensuring that his top leadership whipped against it. As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/25/us/politics/house-defeats-effort-to-rein-in-nsa-data-gathering.html?hp">the New York Times put it</a> in its account of yesterday&#8217;s vote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Conservative Republicans leery of what they see as Obama administration abuses of power teamed up with liberal Democrats long opposed to intrusive intelligence programs. <em>The Obama administration made common cause with the House Republican leadership to try to block it.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In reality, the fate of the amendment was sealed when the Obama White House on Monday night <a href="http://pastebin.com/RF5U59N0">announced its vehement opposition to it</a>, and then sent NSA officials to the House to scare members that barring the NSA from collecting all phone records of all Americans would Help The Terrorists™.</p>
<p>Using Orwellian language so extreme as to be darkly hilarious, this was the first line of the White House&#8217;s statement opposing the amendment: &#8220;In light of the recent unauthorized disclosures, the President has said that he welcomes a debate about how best to simultaneously safeguard both our national security and the privacy of our citizens&#8221; (i.e.: we welcome the debate that has been exclusively enabled by that vile traitor, the same debate we&#8217;ve spent years trying to prevent with rampant abuse of our secrecy powers that has kept even the most basic facts about our spying activities concealed from the American people).</p>
<p>The White House then condemned Amash/Conyers this way: &#8220;This blunt approach is not the product of an informed, open, or deliberative process.&#8221; What a multi-level masterpiece of Orwellian political deceit that sentence is. The highly surgical Amash/Conyers amendment &#8211; which would eliminate a single, specific NSA program of indiscriminate domestic spying &#8211; is a &#8220;blunt approach&#8221;, but the Obama NSA&#8217;s bulk, indiscriminate collection of all Americans&#8217; telephone records is not a &#8220;blunt approach&#8221;. Even worse: Amash/Conyers &#8211; a House bill debated in public and then voted on in public &#8211; is not an &#8220;open or deliberative process&#8221;, as opposed to the Obama administration&#8217;s secret spying activities and the secret court that blesses its secret interpretations of law, which is &#8220;open and deliberative&#8221;. That anyone can write a statement like the one that came from the Obama White House without dying of shame, or giggles, is impressive.</p>
<p>Even more notable than the Obama White House&#8217;s defense of the NSA&#8217;s bulk domestic spying was the behavior of the House Democratic leadership. Not only did they all vote against de-funding the NSA bulk domestic spying program &#8211; that includes liberal icon House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who voted to protect the NSA&#8217;s program &#8211; but Pelosi&#8217;s deputy, Steny Hoyer, whipped against the bill by channeling the warped language and mentality of Dick Cheney. This is <a href="http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2013/07/democratic-whip-description-of.html">the language the Democratic leadership circulated</a> when telling their members to reject Amash/Conyers:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;2) Amash/Conyers/Mulvaney/Polis/Massie Amendment – Bars the NSA and other agencies from using Section 215 of the Patriot Act (as codified by Section 501 of FISA) to collect records, including telephone call records, that pertain to persons who <em>may be in communication with terrorist groups</em>but are not already subject to an investigation under Section 215.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember when Democrats used to object so earnestly when Dick Cheney would scream &#8220;The Terrorists!&#8221; every time someone tried to rein in the National Security State just a bit and so modestly protect basic civil liberties? How well they have learned: now, a bill to ban the government from collecting the telephone records of <em>all Americans</em>, while expressly allowing it to collect the records of anyone for whom there is evidence of wrongdoing, is &#8211; in the language of the House Democratic Leadership &#8211; a bill to Protect The Terrorists.</p>
<p>None of this should be surprising. Remember: this is the same Nancy Pelosi who spent years during the Bush administration pretending to be a vehement opponent of the illegal Bush NSA warrantless eavesdropping program after it was revealed by the New York Times, even though (just as <a href="http://www.salon.com/2007/12/09/democrats_9/">was true of the Bush torture program</a>) she was secretly briefed on it many years earlier when it was first implemented. At the end of June, we published <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jun/27/nsa-inspector-general-report-document-data-collection">the top secret draft report by the Inspector General&#8217;s office of the NSA</a> that was required to provide a comprehensive history of the NSA warrantless eavesdropping program secretly ordered by Bush in late 2001. That report included this passage:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Within the first 30 days of the Program, over 190 people were cleared into the Program. This number included Senators Robert Graham and Richard Shelby, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, President George W. Bush, Vice President Richard Cheney, Counsel to the Vice President David Addington, and Presidential Assistant I. Lewis &#8216;Scooter&#8217; Libby.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So the history of Democratic leaders such as Nancy Pelosi isn&#8217;t one of opposition to mass NSA spying when Bush was in office, only to change positions now that Obama is. The history is of pretend opposition &#8211; of deceiving their supporters by feigning opposition &#8211; while actually supporting it.</p>
<p>But the most notable aspect of yesterday&#8217;s events was the debate on the House floor. The most vocal defenders of the Obama White House&#8217;s position were Rep. Mike Rogers, the very hawkish GOP Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and GOP Congresswoman Michele Bachmann. Echoing the Democratic House leadership, Bachmann repeatedly warned that NSA bulk spying was necessary to stop &#8220;Islamic jihadists&#8221;, and she attacked Republicans who supported de-funding for rendering the nation vulnerable to The Terrorists.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amash led the debate against the NSA program and repeatedly assigned time to many of the House&#8217;s most iconic liberals to condemn in the harshest terms the NSA program defended by the Obama White House. Conyers repeatedly stood to denounce the NSA program as illegal, unconstitutional and extremist. Manhattan&#8217;s Jerry Nadler said that &#8220;no administration should be permitted to operate beyond the law, as they&#8217;ve been doing&#8221;. Newly elected Democrat Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, an Iraq War combat veteran considered a rising star in her party, said that she could not in good conscience take a single dollar from taxpayers to fund programs that infringe on exactly those constitutional rights our troops (such as herself) have risked their lives for; she told me after the vote, by Twitter direct message, that the &#8220;battle [was] lost today but war not over. We will continue to press on this issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>In between these denunciations of the Obama NSA from House liberals, some of the most conservative members of the House stood to read from the Fourth Amendment. Perhaps the most amazing moment came when GOP Rep. James Sensenbrenner - <em>the prime author of the Patriot Act back in 2001</em> and a long-time defender of War on Terror policies under both Bush and Obama &#8211; stood up to say that the NSA&#8217;s domestic bulk spying far exceeds the bounds of the law he wrote as well as his belief in the proper limits of domestic surveillance, and announced his support for Amash/Conyers. Sensenbrenner was then joined in voting to de-fund the NSA program by House liberals such as Barbara Lee, Rush Holt, James Clyburn, Nydia Velázquez, Alan Grayson, and Keith Ellison.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Senate, Democrat Ron Wyden continues to invoke unusually harsh language to condemn what the NSA is doing under Obama. Here is some of what he said in a speech this week at the Center for American Progress, as <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/312929-wyden-warns-data-collection-under-patriot-act-is-limitless#ixzz2a2mI2mxB">reported by the Hill</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) on Tuesday urged the United States to revamp its surveillance laws and practices, warning that the country will &#8216;live to regret it&#8217; if it fails to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;If we do not seize this unique moment in our constitutional history to reform our surveillance laws and practices, we will all live to regret it . . . The combination of increasingly advanced technology with a breakdown in the checks and balances that limit government action could lead us to a surveillance state that cannot be reversed,&#8217; he added. . . .</p>
<p>&#8220;The government has essentially kept people in the dark about their broad interpretations of the law, he said. Wyden tells constituents there are two Patriot Acts: One they read online at home and &#8216;the secret interpretation of the law that the government is actually relying upon.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;If Americans are not able to learn how their government is interpreting and executing the law then we have effectively eliminated the most important bulwark of our democracy,&#8221; he said. . . .</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;This means that the government&#8217;s authority to collect information on law-abiding American citizens is essentially limitless&#8217;, he said.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Wyden&#8217;s full speech &#8211; in which he makes clear that it is solely the disclosures of the last seven weeks that have enabled this debate and brought about a massive shift in public opinion &#8211; is remarkable and can be read <a href="http://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/blog/post/wyden-on-nsa-domestic-surveillance">here</a>. That&#8217;s a senior Democrat and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee sounding exactly like Edward Snowden &#8211; and the ACLU &#8211; in denouncing the abuses of the American Surveillance State. Meanwhile, as soon as the House vote was over, Rep. Rush Holt, a long-time Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee,<a href="http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2013/07/rush-holt-repeal-surveillance-state-act.html">introduced</a> &#8220;The Surveillance State Repeal Act&#8221; that would repeal the legislative foundation for this massive spying, including the once-and-now-again-controversial Patriot Act, which the Obama administration in 2011 successfully had renewed without a single reform (after Democrat Harry Reid <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/harry-reid-rand-paul-spar-over-patriot-act-on-senate-floor/2011/05/25/AGcgWRBH_blog.html">accused opponents of its reform-free renewal</a> of endangering the Nation to The Terrorists).</p>
<p>To say that there is a major sea change underway &#8211; not just in terms of surveillance policy but broader issues of secrecy, trust in national security institutions, and civil liberties &#8211; is to state the obvious. But perhaps the most significant and enduring change will be the erosion of the trite, tired prism of partisan simplicity through which American politics has been understood over the last decade. What one sees in this debate is not Democrat v. Republican or left v. right. One sees authoritarianism v. individualism, fealty to The National Security State v. a belief in the need to constrain and check it, insider Washington loyalty v. outsider independence.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why the only defenders of the NSA at this point are the decaying establishment leadership of both political parties whose allegiance is to the sprawling permanent power faction in Washington and the private industry that owns and controls it. They&#8217;re aligned against long-time liberals, the new breed of small government conservatives, the ACLU and other civil liberties groups, many of their own members, and<a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/07/10/1222479/-Quinnipiac-Massive-Shift-as-Public-Now-Says-War-on-Terror-Has-Gone-Too-Far">increasingly the American people</a>, who have grown tired of, and immune to, the relentless fear-mongering.</p>
<p>The sooner the myth of &#8220;intractable partisan warfare&#8221; is dispelled, the better. The establishment leadership of the two parties collaborate on far more than they fight. That is a basic truth that needs to be understood. As John Boehner joined with Nancy Peolsi, as Eric Cantor whipped support for the Obama White House, as Michele Bachmann and Peter King stood with Steny Hoyer to attack NSA critics as Terrorist-Lovers, yesterday was a significant step toward accomplishing that.</p>

Austerity measures aimed largely at the poor are being imposed on all the nations of the world. Weather events grow more deadly and brushfire wars more frequent. An AK-47 can be obtained for $49 in the markets of West Africa. The depopulation campaign of the inbred <i>Illuminati</i>bankers is accelerating.</p>
<p><b>In 1957 President Dwight Eisenhower</b>, who later warned of a “military-industrial complex”, commissioned a panel of scientists to study the issue of overpopulation. The scientists put forth Alternatives I, II and III, advocating both the release of deadly viruses and perpetual warfare as means to decrease world population.</p>
<p>The first supposition dovetailed nicely with the pharmaceutical interests of the Rockefellers. According to Nexus magazine, the Rockefellers own one-half of the US pharmaceutical industry, which would reap billions developing medicines to “battle” the deadly viruses about to be released.</p>
<p><b>In 1969 the Senate Church Committee discovered that the US Defense Department</b> (DOD) had requested a budget of tens of millions of taxpayer dollars for a program to speed development of new viruses which target and destroy the human immune system. DOD officials testified before Congress that they planned to produce, “a synthetic biological agent, an agent that does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could be acquired… Most important is that it might be refractory to the immunological and therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from infectious disease.” House Bill 5090 authorized the funds and MK-NAOMI was carried out at Fort Detrick, Maryland.</p>
<p>Out of this research came the AIDS virus which was targeted at “undesirable elements” of the population. The first AIDS viruses were administered through a massive smallpox vaccine campaign in central and southern Africa by the World Health Organization in 1977. A year later ads appeared in major US newspapers soliciting “promiscuous gay male volunteers” to take part in a Hepatitis B vaccine study. [1]</p>
<p><b>The program targeted male homosexuals age 20-40 in New York City</b>, Los Angeles, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco. It was administered by the US Centers for Disease Control which, under its earlier incarnation as the US Public Health Department in Atlanta, oversaw the Tuskegee syphilis experiments on African American males. [2]</p>
<p>San Francisco has been a target of numerous CIA experiments, due to its high population of left-leaning and gay citizens, which the Illuminati views as “undesirables”. According to Dr. Eva Snead, San Francisco has one of the highest cancer rates in the country. For years, malathion – first developed by the Nazis – was sprayed over the city by helicopters from the CIA’s Evergreen Air, whose Arizona base is used, according to author William Cooper, as CIA transshipment point for Columbian cocaine. The mysterious Legionnaire’s Disease occurs often in San Francisco and the CIA’s MK-ULTRA mind control bad acid program was based there.</p>
<p><b>The intellectual force behind the introduction of AIDS</b> was the Bilderberger Group, which became fixated on population control after WWII. Author Cooper says the Policy Committee of the Bilderbergers gave orders to DOD to introduce the AIDS virus. The Bilderbergers are close to the Club of Rome, which was founded on a Rockefeller estate near Bellagio, Italy and is backed by the same European Black Nobility who frequent Bilderberger meetings. A 1968 study by the Club of Rome advocated lowering the birth rate and increasing the death rate. Club founder Dr. Aurelio Peccei made a top-secret recommendation to introduce a microbe that would attack the auto-immune system, then develop a vaccine as a prophylactic for the global elite. [3]</p>
<p>One month after the 1968 Club of Rome meeting Paul Ehrlich published <i>The Population Bomb</i>. The book hints at a draconian depopulation plan in the works. On page seventeen Ehrlich writes, “The problem could have been avoided by population control…so that a ‘death rate solution’ did not have to occur.” A year later MK-NAOMI was born. Peccei himself authored the Club of Rome’s much-touted <i>Global 2000</i> report, which President Jimmy Carter pushed on his BCCI shakedown cruise of Africa. Peccei wrote in the report, “Man is now vested with unprecedented, tremendous responsibilities and thrown into the role of moderator of life on the planet- including his own”.</p>
<p>The Bilderbergers were behind the Haig-Kissinger Depopulation Policy, a driving force at the State Department and administered by the National Security Council. Pressure is applied to Third World countries to reduce their populations. Those that do not comply see their US aid withheld or are subject to Pink Plan low-intensity war that targets civilians, especially women of child-bearing age. In Africa famine and brush-fire wars are encouraged. AK-47 rifles can be bought at West African markets for under $50. The same is true in the markets of Peshawar, Pakistan. In 1975, a year after attending a Club of Rome conference on the topic, Secretary of State Kissinger founded the Office of Population Affairs (OPA).</p>
<blockquote><p>DOD officials testified before Congress that they planned to produce, “a synthetic biological agent, an agent that does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could be acquired… Most important is that it might be refractory to the immunological and therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from infectious disease.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Latin American OPA case officer Thomas Ferguson spilled the beans on OPA’s agenda when he stated, “There is a single theme behind all our work; we must reduce population levels. Either they do it our way, through nice clean methods or they will get the kind of mess that we have in El Salvador, or in Iran, or in Beirut…Once population is out of control it requires authoritarian government, even fascism, to reduce it…The professionals aren’t interested in reducing population for humanitarian reasons…Civil wars are somewhat drawn-out ways to reduce population. The quickest way to reduce population is through famine like in Africa. We go into a country and say, here is your goddamn development plan. Throw it out the window. Start looking at your population…if you don’t …then you’ll have an El Salvador or an Iran, or worse, a Cambodia”. [4]</p>
<p><b>Ferguson said of El Salvador, “To accomplish what the State Department </b>deems adequate population control, the civil war (run by CIA) would have to be greatly expanded. You have to pull all the males into fighting and kill significant numbers of fertile, child-bearing age females. You are killing a small number of males and not enough fertile females to do the job…If the war went on 30-40 years, you might accomplish something. Unfortunately, we don’t have too many instances of this to study”.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Report from Iron Mountain</b></span></p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.redicecreations.com/ul_img/25672pyramidstone.jpg" align="left" /><b>In 1961 Kennedy Administration officials McGeorge Bundy</b>, Robert McNamara and Dean Rusk, all CFR and Bilderberger members, led a study group which looked into “the problem of peace”. The group met at Iron Mountain, a huge underground corporate nuclear shelter near Hudson, New York, where CFR think tank The Hudson Institute is located. The bunker contains redundant offices in case of nuclear attack for Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell and JP Morgan Chase. [5] A copy of the group discussions, known as <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=iron%20mountain%20secret%20government&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThe_Report_from_Iron_Mountain&amp;ei=5kq_UfCKFfKgyAH1sIFw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEh7GQLQc2tW_eLgekLqZScSUyBEg" target="_blank">Report from Iron Mountain</a>, was leaked by a participant and published in 1967 by Dial Press.</p>
<p>The report’s authors saw war as necessary and desirable stating “War itself is the basic social system, within which other secondary modes of social organization conflict or conspire. (War is) the principal organizing force…the essential economic stabilizer of modern societies.” The group worried that through “ambiguous leadership” the “ruling administrative class” might lose its ability to “rationalize a desired war”, leading to the “actual disestablishment of military institutions”.</p>
<p><b>The report goes on to say, “…the war system cannot responsibly</b> be allowed to disappear until…we know exactly what we plan to put in its place…The possibility of war provides the sense of external necessity without which no government can long remain in power…The basic authority of a modern state over its people resides in its war powers. War has served as the last great safeguard against the elimination of necessary classes.”</p>
<p>Historian Howard Zinn described this conundrum when he wrote, “American capitalism needed international rivalry- and periodic war- to create an artificial community of interest between rich and poor, supplanting the genuine community of interest among the poor that showed itself in sporadic movements”.</p>
<p><b>The Iron Mountain gang was not the first to discover the virtues of war.</b> In 1909 the trustees of the Andrew Carnegie Foundation for International Peace met to discuss pre-WWI American life. Many of the participants were members of Skull &amp; Bones. They concluded, “There are no known means more efficient than war, assuming the objective is altering the life of an entire people…How do we involve the United States in a war?”</p>
<p>The <em>Report from Iron Mountain</em> goes on to propose a proper role for those of the lower classes, crediting military institutions with providing “antisocial elements with an acceptable role in the social structure.  The younger and more dangerous of these hostile social groupings have been kept under control by the Selective Service System…A possible surrogate for the control of potential enemies of society is the reintroduction, in some form consistent with modern technology and political process, of slavery…The development of a sophisticated form of slavery may be an absolute prerequisite for social control in a world at peace.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>“…the war system cannot responsibly be allowed to disappear until… we know exactly what we plan to put in its place… The possibility of war provides the sense of external necessity without which no government can long remain in power… The basic authority of a modern state over its people resides in its war powers.

<p><strong>The Iron Mountain goons, though thrilled by the idea of slavery, listed</strong> as other socioeconomic substitutions for war: a comprehensive social welfare program, a giant open-ended space program aimed at unreachable targets, a permanent arms inspection regime, an omnipresent global police and peacekeeping force, massive global environmental pollution which would require a large labor pool to clean up, socially-oriented blood sports and a comprehensive eugenics program. [6]</p>
<p>The Iraqi genocide fulfilled the dreams of the Club of Rome Zero Population Growth maniacs, while also providing a testing ground for two of the war substitutes proposed by the Iron Mountain fascists: an arms inspection regime and UN peacekeepers.  Both concepts gained traction in the international community thanks to the Gulf War.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Let the Iraqi Genocide Begin</strong></p>
<p><strong>Estimates of Iraqi casualties during the Gulf War are sobering</strong>.  Some organizations like Greenpeace put the death toll at near one million people.  It was a war in which the media was denied access on a scale never before seen, so casualty figures vary greatly.  According to Tony Murphy, a researcher at the International War Crimes Tribunal, the US attack on Iraq killed 125,000 civilians, while destroying 676 schools, 38 hospitals, 8 major hydroelectric dams, 11 power plants, 119 power substations and half the country’s telephone lines.  The attacks occurred mostly at night when people were most vulnerable.</p>
<p>In the months following the war the death rate of Iraqi children under five tripled.  Thirty-eight percent of these deaths were caused by diarrhea. [7]  Victor Filatov, a Russian journalist reporting for <em>Sovetskaya Rossiya</em> from post-war Baghdad wrote, “What further bloodshed do these barbarians of the 20th century need?  I thought the Americans had changed since Vietnam…but no, they never change.  They remain true to themselves.”</p>
<p><strong>According to former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark, the US was found guilty</strong> of nineteen war crimes against Iraq before the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=international%20war%20crimes%20tribunal&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FInternational_Criminal_Court&amp;ei=v1q_Uf6xBKqQyQGgsIBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHrcA416NJD3FzUxz-76qj-liCvtg&amp;bvm=bv.47883778,d.aWc" target="_blank">International War Crimes Tribunal</a>.  The US dropped 88,000 tons of bombs on Iraq during the Gulf War and has rained down countless more bombs since.  Many bombs were tipped with armor piercing depleted uranium (DU) warheads, which may account for chronic Iraqi health problems.  Dr. Siegwart-Horst Gunther, a German physician who came to Iraq to help its people, became gravely ill when he handled just one cigar-sized fragment from a DU warhead.  Dr. Gunther measured the tiny object’s radioactivity to be 11 microSv per hour, whereas an acceptable exposure is no more than 300 microSv per year. [8]  Three hundred tons of DU ammunition was deployed during the war.</p>
<p>Many believe DU is responsible for Gulf War Syndrome, which has killed and permanently injured many US soldiers who fought in the Persian Gulf theater.  Since 2000, nearly 11,000 US Gulf War veterans have died from Gulf War Syndrome, while the Pentagon continues to cover up this travesty.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Satanism &amp; Psychotronic Warfare</strong></p>
<p><strong>The US also tested numerous top-secret high-tech weapons</strong> <strong>systems</strong> in the Gulf theatre, while utilizing some old low-frequency favorites.  When Iraqi ground forces surrendered, many of them were in a state of delirium and lethargy that could have been induced by extremely low-frequency radio waves, which the US used as a weapon as early as the Vietnam conflict.</p>
<p>Yale University and CIA psychiatrist Dr. Jose Delgado studied mind control for the Company <img alt="" src="http://loveforlife.com.au/files/2neumy3.jpg" width="268" height="201" data-lazy-type="image" data-lazy-src="http://loveforlife.com.au/files/2neumy3.jpg" />during the 1950’s as part of the MK-ULTRA program.  Delgado determined, “Physical control of many brain functions is a demonstrated fact…it is even possible to create and follow intentions…By electronic stimulation of specific cerebral structures, movements can be induced by radio command…by remote control.”</p>
<p><strong>According to a military document written by Colonel Paul Valley</strong> and Major Michael Aquino titled <em>From PSYOP to Mindwar: The Psychology of Victory</em>, the US Army used an operational weapons system “to map the minds of neutral and enemy individuals and then to change them in accordance with US national interests”.  The technique was used to secure the surrender of 29,276 armed Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army soldiers in 1967 and 1968.  The US Navy was also heavily involved in “psychotronic” research. [9]  Many US soldiers who served near the DMZ that divided North and South Vietnam claimed to see UFOs on a regular basis.  <em>The Pentagon Papers</em> revealed that an electronic barrier was placed along the DMZ by the secretive <a href="http://www.redicecreations.com/article.php?id=1142" target="_blank">JASON Society</a>.</p>
<p>Major Michael Aquino was an Army psyops specialist in Vietnam, where his unit specialized in drug-inducement, brainwashing, virus injection, brain implants, hypnosis, and use of electromagnetic fields and extremely low-frequency radio waves.  After Vietnam, Aquino moved to San Francisco and founded the Temple of Set.  Set is the ancient Egyptian name for Lucifer.  Aquino was now a senior US Military Intelligence official. [10]  He’d been given a Top Secret security clearance on June, 9, 1981.  Less than a month later an Army intelligence memo revealed that Aquino’s Temple of Set was an off-shoot of Anton La Vey’s Church of Satan, also headquartered in San Francisco. Two other Set members were Willie Browning and Dennis Mann.  Both were Army Intelligence officers.</p>
<p><strong>The Temple of Set was obsessed with military matters and political fascism</strong>.  It was especially preoccupied with the Nazi Order of the Trapezoid.  Aquino’s “official” job was history professor at Golden Gate College.  The Temple recruited the same Hells Angels who Billy Mellon Hitchcock had used to dole out his bad CIA acid.  Its members frequented prostitutes where they engaged in all manner of sadomasochistic activities. [11]  Director of Army Counter-Intelligence Donald Press revealed that Dennis Mann was assigned to the 306 PSYOPS Battalion and that Aquino was assigned to a top secret program known as Presidio.</p>
<p>Presidio is also the name of a spooky complex in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which Mikhail Gorbachev reportedly frequented as the Soviet Union was falling apart.  Was Aquino part of an operation to “map the mind” of the Soviet Union’s last leader and induce him into proposing both <em>glasnost</em> and <em>perestroika</em>, the two free market policies that ultimately led to the Soviet Union’s demise?  Remember the curious mark which suddenly appeared on Gorbachev’s forehead?  Was he implanted with some sort of microchip mind-control device to make him think “in accordance with US national interests”?</p>
<p><strong>Such Orwellian technology is marketed on a regular basis throughout the world</strong>.  International Healthline Corporation and others sell microchip implants in the US, Russia and Europe.  The Humane Society has adopted a policy of micro-chipping all stray pets. The State of Hawaii <em>requires</em> that all pets be micro-chipped.  Six thousand people in Sweden have accepted a microchip in their hand, which they use for all purchases. Trials are also underway in Japan.  In July 2002, National Public Radio reported a similar trial beginning in Seattle.  Later in 2002, after a rash of suspicious abductions of young girls, BBC reported that a British company plans to implant children with microchips so that their parents can monitor their whereabouts.</p>
<p>Dr. Carl Sanders, a highly acclaimed electronics engineer, revealed that a microchip project he launched to help people with severed spinal cords was taken over by Bill Colby’s <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=bill%20colby%20%2B%20operation%20phoenix%20&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPhoenix_Program&amp;ei=OFu_UefeCKqgyAG6goGYCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNG0OWTTqoG1_WcdtidXIwaGL9YXNQ&amp;bvm=bv.47883778,d.aWc" target="_blank">Operation Phoenix </a>in a series of meetings organized by Henry Kissinger.  Sanders says the optimal spot for a microchip implant is just below the hairline on a person’s forehead, since the device can be recharged by changes in body temperatures, which are most pronounced there.  Interestingly, this is the location of the pineal gland or Third Eye.</p>
<p><strong>The 1986 Emigration Control Act grants the President the power to mandate</strong> any kind of ID he deems necessary. [12]  Researchers at Southern California have developed a chip which mimics the hippocampus, the part of the brain that deals with memory.  Pentagon officials are interested in using it in experiments to create a “super-soldier”. [13]  Another microchip called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BrainGate" target="_blank">Brain Gate</a> is being implanted in paralyzed people.  It allows them to control their environment by simply thinking. [14]</p>
<p>In Iraq, psychological warfare gave way to slow genocide.  According to UNICEF, as of late 2001, 1.5 million Iraqi children had died as a result of sanctions, while one child in ten died before their first birthday.  Thalassemia, anemia and diarrhea were the biggest killers and could have been prevented were it not for a chronic shortage of blood and medicine in Iraq due to the sanctions.  UN Committee 661 served as arbiter of what constituted a “dual use” item and therefore banned for import into Iraq.  As of 2001, over 1,600 Iraqi contracts with Western companies for medical equipment had been blocked by 661. [15]</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Yale University and CIA psychiatrist Dr. Jose Delgado studied mind control for the Company during the 1950’s as part of the MK-ULTRA program.  Delgado determined, “Physical control of many brain functions is a demonstrated fact…it is even possible to create and follow intentions…By electronic stimulation of specific cerebral structures, movements can be induced by radio command…by remote control.”</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Gulf War decimated Iraq’s sewer and water treatment systems</strong>.  Iraqis were forced to drink polluted water, leading to numerous health problems.  Iraq was not allowed to import chlorine to clean the water since 661 deemed it a potential chemical weapon.  Electrical power was rationed in three-hour daily increments per household since the Iraqi government couldn’t get the parts it needed to fix its power plants after the US bombed its entire power grid.  With the devaluation of the Iraqi <em>dinar</em> and the ban on the export of 2.4 million barrels of oil per day, the average Iraqi lived on $2.50 a month- enough to buy a pair of shoes.  The only Iraqis not affected were the wealthy elite, who had long ago stashed their savings overseas in US dollars.</p>
<p>UNICEF estimates that 28% of Iraqi children no longer went to school.  Before the war almost all children attended.  Often families could only afford to send one child to school because of the cost of simple things like backpacks, shoes and notebooks.  Rafah Salam Aziz, Director of Mansour Children’s Hospital, said parents were often forced to make similar decisions about their children’s lives.  Aziz said, “Many times it’s easier for a family to let a baby die rather than let the whole family go hungry and get sick.”[16]</p>
<p><strong>In 1996 Clinton Defense Secretary William Perry announced a new military buildup</strong> in the Persian Gulf.  Soon cruise missiles were again raining down on Baghdad.  Many nations now grew weary of both US bombing and the sanctions regime, which was brutalizing the Iraqi people while strengthening the grip of Saddam Hussein.  Russian President Boris Yeltsin, whose country signed a deal with Iraq to rebuild its shattered oil sector, said he was disturbed at the use of “extreme and radical force against the Arab world”.  The Russian opposition offered a more scalding appraisal.  Alexander Lebed stating angrily, “The US is like a strong master who spits on everybody.”[17]</p>
<p>Turkey, Jordan and Syria all expressed unease over the new round of bombing.  Even the Saudis, where Islamic fundamentalism was on the rise and two major bombings had occurred at US bases, now refused to allow the US to use its bases to bomb Iraq.  Many countries, including France, began openly flaunting the UN embargo against Iraq in the late 1990’s.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis Halliday, former Assistant Secretary of the UN </strong>who initially headed the UN Humanitarian Program to Iraq, resigned his post in protest. He said sanctions were demolishing the very class of Iraqi people who wanted to create a better government in the country.  He was scornful of the UN Oil for Food Program under which the US received 70% of Iraqi oil.  Halliday stated plainly, “We are guilty of committing genocide, through the Security Council, against Iraq.”[18]</p>
<p>Halliday’s 1998 successor was Hans Van Sponeck, who watched as the UN unfurled the UNSCOM arms inspection regime, paid for by Iraqi oil sales.  US inspector Scott Ritter confirmed Iraqi suspicions that UNSCOM was gathering intelligence for CIA and Mossad.  UNSCOM was just the latest CIA tool.  In 1996 the Iraqi government claimed international relief agencies, including the World Food Program, which claimed to be helping the Kurds, were actually CIA operatives attempting to destabilize the country.</p>
<p><strong>In fact the CIA had spent more than $20 million in its support of the Iraqi National Congress</strong>, led by long-time CIA surrogate Jalal Talibani’s PKK Kurdish faction. [19]  In January 1997 Iraq uncovered two Mossad spy rings in one month following the attempted assassination of Saddam Hussein’s son. [20]  Hans Van Sponeck had seen enough. He too resigned in protest.</p>
<p>In early 1999 it was revealed that the US had used UNSCOM to plant electronic bugging devices in the Iraqi Ministry of Defense.  Arms inspector Scott Ritter said the CIA was using UNSCOM to “provoke a crisis”.  In December 1998 UNSCOM, faced with the embarrassing accusations of espionage, pulled out of Iraq.  On December 15th the US launched a new round of bombing.  Ritter says intelligence gathered by UNSCOM was used for targeting. UNSCOM spokesman David Kay resurfaced in 2003 calling for a US invasion of Iraq. He now worked for SAIC, which landed numerous Pentagon contracts to rebuild Iraq.</p>

				<p>June 17, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17869#respond" title="Comment on Is Naomi Wolf Working For The NSA?"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="17869 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17869">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
			</div>
		
			<p>I hate to do this, but I feel obligated to share, as the story unfolds, my creeping concern that the writer Naomi Wolf is not whom she purports to be, and that her motive in writing an article on her public Facebook page speculating about whether National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden might actually be still working for the NSA, could be to support the government’s effort to destroy him.</p>
<p>After all, with Snowden under vicious attack by both the government and the corporate media, being wrongly accused of treason, or portrayed as a drop-out slacker, a narcissist, a loser hoping to gain fame and even a “cross-dressing” weirdo, what defender of liberty would pile on with publication of a work of absolutely fact-free speculation as to whether he might also be a kind of “double agent” put out there by the NSA in order to discourage <em>real potential whistleblowers</em> from even considering leaking information about government spying on Americans.</p>
<p>Because that is exactly what Wolf has done on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/naomi-wolf/my-creeping-concern-that-the-nsa-leaker-is-not-who-he-purports-to-be-/10151559239607949">her website</a> [1] (the first clause at the opening of this article is a direct quote from the lead in Wolf’s Facebook piece, but with her name substituted for Snowden’s).</p>
<p>What basis does she offer for her wild-eyed speculation that Snowden is perhaps “not who he purports to be”?</p>
<p>Well, first of all she notes darkly that US spy agencies “create false identities, build fake companies, influence real media with fake stories, create distractions or demonizations in the local news that advance US policies, bug (technologically) and harass the opposition, disrupt and infiltrate the meetings and communications of factions that the US does not wish to see in power.” This, she says, touting her own now rather dated 2007 book <em>The End of America,</em> is “something you can’t not see if you spend time around people who are senior in both the political establishment and the intelligence and state department establishments. You also can’t avoid seeing it if you interview principled defectors from those systems, as I have done&#8230;”</p>
<p>Then, after having assuring us of how well-connected she is, she raises what she calls “red flags” about Snowden:</p>
<div>
<img src="http://www.thiscantbehappening.net/sites/default/files/images/Who'sTheSpook.jpg" width="556" height="234" /><br />
<em>Who&#8217;s acting in the interest of the NSA: Naomi Wolf or Edward Snowden?</em></p>
</div>
<p>* “I was concerned about the way Snowden conveys his message. He is not struggling for words, or thinking hard, as even bright, articulate whistleblowers under stress will do. Rather he appears to be transmitting whole paragraphs smoothly, without stumbling. To me this reads as someone who has learned his talking points — again the way that political campaigns train surrogates to transmit talking points.” (Um, Naomi, you know, don’t you, that he was videotaped for that by a filmmaker, and there were, no doubt, multiple takes and edits to allow him to get it right?)</p>
<p>* “He keeps saying things like, ‘If you are a journalist and they think you are the transmission point of this info, they will certainly kill you.’ Or: ‘I fully expect to be prosecuted under the Espionage Act.’ He also keeps stressing what he will lose: his $200,000 salary, his girlfriend, his house in Hawaii. These are the kinds of messages that the police state would LIKE journalists to take away.” In case we miss the point, she adds, implying rather strongly that she is concluding Snowden is a fake, “A real whistleblower also does not put out potential legal penalties as options, and almost always by this point has a lawyer by his/her side who would PROHIBIT him/her from saying, ‘come get me under the Espionage Act.’ Finally in my experience, real whistleblowers are completely focused on their act of public service and trying to manage the jeopardy to themselves and their loved ones; they don’t tend ever to call attention to their own self-sacrifice.”</p>
<p>* “It is actually in the Police State’s interest to let everyone know that everything you write or say everywhere is being surveilled, and that awful things happen to people who challenge this. Which is why I am not surprised that now he is on UK no-fly lists – I assume the end of this story is that we will all have a lesson in terrible things that happen to whistleblowers.” She adds, in a further indictment of Snowden, “That could be because he is a real guy who gets in trouble; but it would be as useful to the police state if he is a fake guy who gets in ‘trouble.’”</p>
<p>* She says he talks incessantly about the beautiful “pole-dancer” girlfriend he abandoned (actually he did that for her safety, Naomi), implying his repetition process might be so that the media have a justification to keep showing her sexy photo (as though our prurient media needs a justification to do such a thing).</p>
<p>* The media keep saying he is in a “safe house” in Hong Kong, which according to Wolf cannot exist in the former British colony, now a part of China, “Unless you are with the one organization that can still get off the surveillance grid, because that org created it.”</p>
<p>* He’s not surrounded by an army of attorneys the way Wikileaks’ Julian Assange was when he traveled (and by the way, I recall that for a long time, after Wikileaks ran the Bradley Manning documents, including the horrific “Collateral Damage” war crime video, there were conspiracy theorists out there claiming baselessly that he was actually probably a Mossad asset &#8212; this on the basis that he had not been sufficiently leaking damaging information about Israel’s actions against Palestinians).<br />
That’s it, folks! All sheer wild speculation about Snowden, with not even one shred of actual evidence against him to suggest he’s anything but what he says he is: a young man who was hired to do some really dirty work spying on Americans en masse, who decided that what was happening was the creation of a totalitarian system, and who had the courage of, instead of walking away from it, putting his life in jeopardy by publicly blowing the whistle.</p>
<p>I have nothing against trying to uncover conspiracies, particularly those orchestrated by a government like our own which we know has manufactured from whole cloth faked evidence to justify a war in Iraq that killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people, even to the point of torturing captives to get them to make up tales that would justify that fake evidence. But when someone with Wolf’s reputation on the left sinks to this level of baseless and libelous accusations against a brave person who is under attack by that government, it cannot be allowed to pass.</p>
<p>Of course, I don’t really think that Wolf is acting as an agent for the government (I could only speculate about that, and I won’t). And if she were just thinking these idle thoughts, and maybe raising them in a playful discussion at home with a few friends over dinner, I would see nothing wrong in the exercise. But as a highly media-savvy public person, she’s publishing them intentionally where they will be widely circulated: on her publicly accessible Facebook page. I have to conclude she has allowed her instinct for self-promotion and grandstanding in this case to let her do something truly treacherous and unconscionable: baselessly defaming and attacking the credibility of a brave whistleblower who is under officially orchestrated attack.</p>
<p>As a long-time investigative reporter, I also dispute Wolf’s self-serving claim that her own experience in dealing with whistleblowers shows them to be uniformly disorganized and inarticulate. In my experience, some are very disorganized and hard to follow because of their focus on the trees in their personal forest, but some whistleblowers are intensely organized and know exactly what they want to tell you as a journalist. They are also apt, organized or not, contrary to what Wolf says, to highlight the danger they are in, and that they may be putting the reporter in. Sometimes this may be simply to make sure you are interested and recognize the seriousness of what they have to say, and sometimes it is out of genuine fear for themselves and concern for the journalist’s safety, and perhaps also to make sure you fully understand what you’re getting into and that you will not cave and reveal their identity the moment you are put under pressure yourself.</p>
<p>Wolf, who always makes a point of mentioning she’s a Yale grad and a Rhodes Scholar who studied at Oxford, should take care in assuming that someone with only a high school diploma speaking in whole sentences or paragraphs is probably reciting “talking points” from a script. Her assumption reeks of class-based stereotyping. I have met car mechanics, who besides working miracles on my old cars, can speak in multiple paragraphs about politics, often with more wisdom and insight than most of the ivy-league pundits on the tube.</p>
<p>As for Wolf’s claim of there being “no safe houses” in Hong Kong, I just have to laugh. Having lived in Hong Kong for five years, I can assure her that there are myriad urban warrens all over Hong Kong where one could hide for decades undetected, as well as vast stretches of tropical wilderness in the New Territories where people can become lost for days, even with professional rescue teams looking for them. Wolf should stick to things she has actual knowledge about (maybe vaginas, judging by the name of her latest book?), instead of trashing good people on the basis of ignorant speculation and pretend savvy.</p>
<p>Unless and until someone comes up with a single hard fact seriously suggesting that Snowden is a fake, this kind of fantasizing should halt. Wolf should apologize for her self-aggrandizing tripe and make a generous donation from her book sales to the <a href="http://boldprogressives.org/2013/06/help-edward-snowden-the-29-year-old-who-revealed-the-governments-spying/">Snowden defense fund</a> [2] &#8211; unless of course she has evidence that the Progressive Change Campaign Committee is an NSA or CIA front group.</p>

<p>“I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the President, if I had a personal e-mail,” Edward Snowden <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance" target="_blank">told the <i>Guardian</i></a>. Snowden is twenty-nine; he had worked in a technical capacity for the C.I.A. and then, by way of his employer, Booz Allen Hamilton, as a contractor for the N.S.A. He is the reason our country has, in the last week, been having a conversation on privacy and the limits of domestic surveillance. That was overdue, and one wishes it had been prompted by self-examination on the part of the Obama Administration or real oversight by Congress. But both failed, and it came in the form of Snowden handing highly classified documents—a lot of them—to journalists.</p>
<div id="entry-more">
<p>He did so, he said, because he had seen “abuses”—the framework for an “architecture of oppression”—and had come to “realize that these things have to be decided by the public, not someone who is hired by the government.” Snowden, of course, <em>is</em> someone hired by the government, and will be asked why he thought the decision to expose secrets was his. He offered, in his interview, several answers: one is that the normal processes were broken. The second was that he is willing to come out in the open himself. Saturday night, the N.S.A. asked for a criminal investigation into the leaks. As we learn more about him, in the next days, those answers are worth evaluating seriously.</p>
<p>Snowden is now holed up in Hong Kong, in a hotel room where, according to the <em>Guardian</em>, he stuffs pillows against the doors and “puts a large red hood over his head and laptop when entering his passwords.” The interview has the bylines of Glenn Greenwald, Ewen MacAskill, and Laura Poitras. Poitras was also a co-author, with Barton Gellman, of a report in the Washington <em>Post</em> based on documents Snowden provided; and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/intelligence-leaders-push-back-on-leakers-media/2013/06/09/fff80160-d122-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_story.html" target="blank">Gellman and Aaron Blake posted their own piece with Snowden later Sunday</a>. [<em>Update: Sunday night, Gellman posted a piece on his interactions with Snowden, who had <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/code-name-verax-snowden-in-exchanges-with-post-reporter-made-clear-he-knew-risks/2013/06/09/c9a25b54-d14c-11e2-9f1a-1a7cdee20287_story.html">used the code name Verax</a>.</em>]</p>
<p>So far, the leaks have revealed that the N.S.A. is collecting records from Verizon Business (and, it emerged, from any number of other companies) for every phone call placed in the United States; that, with a program called Prism and some degree of coöperation from technology companies like Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and Apple, it is looking at the private data of both foreigners it targeted and—“incidentally”—Americans a degree or even two removed from them; that another program, called Boundless Informant, processed billions of pieces of domestic data each month, and many times that from abroad. We also learned that James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, flat-out lied to the Senate when he said that the N.S.A. did not “wittingly” collect any sort of data on millions of Americans. And we were reminded of how disappointing President Obama can be. These were all things the public deserved to know.</p>
<p>Snowden never actually questions the good will of the people he worked with at the N.S.A.; he grants them (as we might grant Obama) their belief that they are working in the interests of the United States—that there is no ideology of oppression. Each step is modest, and does start with the goal of looking for foreign threats. But they collect data wherever and however they can. All of the talk about not specifically targeting Americans should not be reassuring: “The NSA specifically targets the communications of everyone. It ingests them by default. It collects them in its system and it filters them and analyzes them and it measures them and it <em>stores</em> them for a period of time.”</p>
<p>And why should this bother us? Snowden:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s getting to the point, you don’t have to have done anything wrong. You simply have to eventually fall under suspicion from somebody, even by a wrong call, and then they could use this system to go back in time and scrutinize every decision you’ve ever made, every friend you’ve ever discussed something with, and attack you on that basis, to sort of derive suspicion from an innocent life and paint anyone in the context of a wrongdoer.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As he must know, that scrutiny will now be applied to him.</p>
<p>The <i>Guardian</i> reported that Snowden made about two hundred thousand dollars a year and lived in Hawaii, where he had a girlfriend who, he says, didn’t know where he was going or why or when he left for Hong Kong. He had started at the N.S.A. without a high-school diploma, moving along with community-college classes, time in the Army, and technical skill, the<em>Guardian</em> said. (This is somewhat surprising.) In the video, he seems comfortable in his own skin—he will strike some as too at ease, or even pleased. His affect is not that of a haunted informant in the dark corner of a bar. He is the cheeriest major leaker one is likely to come across. That may just accentuate what he is leaving behind by coming forward. (The <em>Guardian</em>said that he got tears in his eyes when discussing the effect this all will have on his family.)</p>
<p>And Snowden is self-aware enough to talk, in the interview, about his own privilege, in two distinct senses of the word. One has to do with his privileges on the job:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>When you’re in positions of privileged access, like a systems administrator for these sort of intelligence communications agencies, you’re exposed to a lot more information on a broader scale than the average employee. And because of that, you see things that may be disturbing.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other is social: “You live a privileged life. You’re living in Hawaii, in paradise, you’re making a ton of money. What would it take to make you leave everything behind?” He talked about living “comfortably” but “unfreely.” (The dystopia he seems to be obsessing about is less “1984” than “Brave New World.”)</p>
<p>Again, he portrayed the niceness of the current custodians as one of the dangers. We were protected, he said, only by “policies,” and not by law: “It’s only going to get worse, until eventually there comes a time when policies change,” and “a new leader will be elected, they’ll flip the switch.” He used a phrase that has come up before: “turnkey tyranny.”</p>
<p>Speaking of tyranny after having fled America for a hotel at the edge of China—the logic won’t be entirely self-explanatory. The <i>Guardian</i> asked Snowden why he chose Hong Kong, which is a Special Administrative Region of China, and does have its own way of doing things—“one country, two systems”—but not at all full autonomy. Did he want to defect? He said he didn’t. We aren’t at war with China, he said, so he wasn’t running to “the enemy”; he put value in Hong Kong’s tradition of free speech. He told Gellman that “I intend to ask for asylum from any countries that believe in free speech and oppose the victimization of global privacy.” (Aaron Blake pointed out that <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronBlakeWP/status/343837424193007617" target="_blank">Hong Kong does have an extradition treaty with the United States</a>.) That may prove to be a harder position to maintain than he would like. Skyscrapers and bookstores are good signs, but they can be deceptive. (It’s also possible that he just wants to complicate the plot.) He talked about the prospect of being rendered by the C.I.A.—“or they could pay off the Triads.” He was, he told both publications, careful about the documents he chose. Had he set out to harm America, he said, there was worse he could do: “I had access to the full rosters of everyone working at the N.S.A., the entire intelligence community and undercover assets around the world.” He also mentioned the money he could have made selling private or corporate information.</p>
<p>The part about undercover assets—and Snowden’s reasons for mentioning his knowledge—will cause many people to pause, properly so. We recognize those as secrets. How many people with a private contractors’ job and a password have the privilege of knowing the names of our spies? (“I’m just another guy,” he told the <i>Guardian</i>.) Sometimes this is a matter of too much classification, rather than too little: if you make everything secret, people need clearances they shouldn’t have just to do their jobs.</p>
<p>But the records of our private lives—whom we called when, where we got lost or fell in love, and what we wrote in late-night e-mails—are secrets, too; of a different scale, not a different species. The prosecutors and politicians who asked how this man had access to one kind of secret should also ask about the other. What are government’s proper privileges? How we respond to the vast assembly of information on Edward Snowden’s computer, or Bradley Manning’s for that matter, is a test. Do we think that the answer is to collect and collect, classify and classify, and then hunt wildly and angrily when a guy in his twenties walks away with more than he should? Or are we ready to talk about our secrets?</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/israelnsa3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/israelnsa2.jpg" align="left" /></a>It doesn&#8217;t surprise. On June 8, Haaretz headlined &#8220;What was the Israeli involvement in collecting US communications intel for NSA?&#8221; More on that below.</p>
<p>On April 3, 2012, James Bamford headlined &#8220;Shady Companies with Ties to Israel Wiretap for US for the NSA.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said NSA chief General Keith Alexander&#8217;s &#8220;having a busy year.&#8221; He&#8217;s &#8220;cutting ribbons at secret bases and bringing to life the agency&#8217;s greatly expanded eavesdropping network.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In January he dedicated the new $358 million CAPT Joseph J. Rochefort Building at NSA Hawaii, and in March he unveiled the 604,000-square-foot John Whitelaw Building at NSA Georgia.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s for around &#8220;4,000 earphone-clad intercept operators, analysts and other specialists, many of them employed by private contractors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spies &#8220;R&#8221; Us defines US policy. NSA&#8217;s &#8220;mammoth 1-million-square-foot, $2 billion Utah Data Center is far more sweeping.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s located at Camp Williams. It&#8217;s a Utah National Guard training facility. Once fully operational, says Bamford, it&#8217;ll &#8220;become, in effect, the NSA Cloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll receive data from NSA satellites, overseas listening posts, and nationwide multipleNo telecom facility monitoring rooms. What&#8217;s planned is an unprecedented global spy network.</p>
<p>NSA operatives and hackers will harvest around 2.1 million gigabytes of data per hour. It&#8217;ll do so on the world&#8217;s most powerful computer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s call Titan Supercomputer. It can handle over 20,000 trillion calculations per second or 20 petaflops. One petaflop = one quadrillion instructions per second.</p>
<p>Supercomputer power will be used to collect and analyze foreign and domestic communications from all possible sources.</p>
<p>Two Israeli companies are involved. High-tech firms Verint and Narus have longstanding US/Israeli intelligence connections. For many years, Verint was a majority-owned Comverse Technology subsidiary.</p>
<p>Both companies have about half their employees in Israel. In August 2012, Verint acquired Comverse. It now operates independently.</p>
<p>It makes security software. It calls itself &#8220;a global leader in Actionable Intelligence solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Narus calls itself a cybersecurity company. It&#8217;s an independent Boeing subsidiary. It provides real-time network traffic and analytics software. It does so with enterprise class spyware capabilities.</p>
<p>In 1997, it was founded in Israel. It created NarusInsight. It&#8217;s a supercomputer system. A previous article said AT&amp;T uses it at their secret San Francisco facility. It lets NSA spy on its customers.</p>
<p>Verint&#8217;s software also is used to do it. Bamford called it &#8220;especially troubling that both companies have had extensive ties to Israel, as well as links to (its) intelligence service.&#8221;</p>
<p>A previous article discussed Israeli spying on America. The CIA calls Israel America&#8217;s main regional spy threat. An Israeli-based CIA operative once found food in his refrigerator rearranged.</p>
<p>Washington knows what&#8217;s going on. Publicly it&#8217;s ignored. Pre-9/11, the FBI uncovered a massive US-based Israeli spy ring. It remains active.</p>
<p>It betrays America. Numerous Israeli citizens are involved. They have close ties to foreign military, criminal and intelligence sources. They reportedly breach US laws with impunity.</p>
<p>Israel&#8217;s featured prominently in annual FBI reports. It actively seeks proprietary/secret US information. It&#8217;s mainly on military systems and advanced computer applications.</p>
<p>Proprietary commercial and industrial data are stolen. Israel recruits spies. Sophisticated methods are used. Computers are hacked for information.</p>
<p>Washington&#8217;s Government Accountability Office (GAO) said Israel &#8220;conducts the most aggressive espionage operation against the United States of any US ally.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Pentagon accused Israel of &#8220;actively engag(ing) in military and industrial espionage in the United States. An Israeli citizen working in the US who has access to proprietary information is likely to be a target of such espionage.&#8221;</p>
<p>FBI whistleblower John Cole said Justice Department officials ordered dozens of Israeli espionage cases dropped. At issue was political pressure.</p>
<p>Washington gives Israel billions of dollars in annual aid, state-of-the-art weapons and technology, and numerous other special privileges. In return, it steals US state and commercial secrets.</p>
<p>Despite longstanding close ties, Washington considers Israel both ally and counterintelligence threat. In terms of technical capability and human resources, it matches America&#8217;s best.</p>
<p>It has access to the highest US political, military and intelligence sources. Bamford said NSA-developed advanced analytical/data-mining software was lawlessly given Israel.</p>
<p>An Operations Directorate technical director did so secretly. Apparently Israeli companies got access. Technology they got advanced their own.</p>
<p>Narus once boasted about being &#8220;known for its ability to capture and collect data from the largest networks around the world.&#8221; Unexplained was that stolen software facilitates is capabilities.</p>
<p>Retired Israeli General Hanan Gefen ran its secret Unit 8200. It&#8217;s Israel&#8217;s NSA equivalent. He admitted Israeli ties to Comverse.</p>
<p>At the time, it owned Verint. It owns other Israeli high-tech companies. They specialize in eavesdropping and surveillance. They operate globally.</p>
<p>According to Gefen, the &#8220;correlation between serving in the intelligence Unit 8200 and starting successful high-tech companies is not coincidental.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of the technologies in use around the world and developed in Israel were originally military technologies and were developed and improved by Unit veterans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kobi Alexander founded Verint. He formerly served as chairman. He&#8217;s a fugitive. FBI accusations include fraud, theft, lying, bribery, money laundering and related crimes.</p>
<p>Two of his top Comverse associates were indicted on similar charges. Both were imprisoned. They paid millions of dollars in fines and penalties.</p>
<p>NSA claims it takes malfeasance and other legitimate complaints seriously. Spying technology and expertise take precedence.</p>
<p>Bamford says take NSA assurances cautiously. &#8220;Who&#8217;s listening to the listeners,&#8221; he asks?</p>
<p>Haaretz asked if Verint and Narus &#8220;collected information from the US communications network&#8221; for NSA?</p>
<p>Neither company responded when asked. Former senior NSA official-turned whistleblower Thomas Drake exposed fraud, waste, abuse and other lawless agency practices.</p>
<p>They relate to warrantless data-mining practices. In April 2010, he was indicted under the Espionage Act. Charges included &#8220;willful retention of classified information, obstruction of justice, and making false statements.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a May 22, 2011 60 Minutes broadcast, all charges were dropped. In return, Drake pled guilty to a minor misdemeanor. He was sentenced to one year probation and community service. He lost his high-paying NSA job and pension.</p>
<p>On March 15, 2013, he spoke at the National Press Club. He focused on First Amendment rights. In part he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;The threats to the First Amendment by the government is bull&#8217;s eye-centered on a free unfettered press designed to suppress and repress speech and political expression in America, create fear through privilege and unilateral authority over what is fit or unfit for the First Amendment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If speech becomes the instrument of crime when revealing government crime and wrongdoing, we are under arbitrary authoritarian rule and not the rule of law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make an argument that government increasingly prefers to operate in the shadows and finds the First Amendment a constraint on its activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet, taking off the veil of government secrecy has more often than not turned truth-tellers and whistleblowers into turncoats and traitors, who are then often criminally burned and blacklisted and broken by the government on the stake of national security.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew too much truth and exposed government illegalities, fraud and abuse and was turned into a criminal for doing so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was charged under the Espionage Act, faced many years in prison and became an enemy of the state.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was five years of living under the boot of the Surveillance State, and yet I was saved by the First Amendment and the court of public opinion and the free press, including the strength and growing resiliency of the alternative media.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we really want the government listening in on and tracking the lives of so many others? Have our constitutional freedoms become the latest victims of 9/11?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will national security replace our individual rights? Will fear take priority over freedom? Will government censorship and propaganda triumph over personal choice and disclosure, use suppression repression?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we starve liberty for the increasingly myopic sake of security, what will we have left to defend?&#8221;</p>
<p>If truth-telling is criminalized, freedom no longer exists.</p>
<p>Drake corroborated information AT&amp;T whistleblower Mark Klein and others reported. Spies &#8220;R&#8221; Us reflects US policy.</p>
<p>Drake verified NSA&#8217;s use of Narus techology. Britain&#8217;s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) collects intelligence from major US Internet companies. They do it via Prism electronic surveillance.</p>
<p>Officially it&#8217;s called US-984XN. It&#8217;s used for sweeping domestic and foreign spying. It&#8217;s the main source for raw NSA intelligence. It&#8217;s top secret for good reason. Now it&#8217;s existence is publicly known.</p>
<p>Mossad&#8217;s longstanding ties to Verint, Narus, and other Israeli surveillance technology companies assures it access to information they collect.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true wherever these companies operate. America has 16 active intelligence agencies. They operate the same way. Warrantless dragnet spying is lawless.</p>
<p>Freedom pays the greatest price. It&#8217;s disappearing in plain sight. It&#8217;s heading for the dustbin of history without legitimate resistance enough to stop it. Nothing less has a chance.</p>

Is it really that hard for most people to believe that we are being assaulted on a daily basis by chemical terrorism? Genetically modified foods, artificial flavours, colors, preservatives, emulsifiers, and sweeteners all made with toxic chemicals, all of which are proven toxic to human health. We are being bombarded on a daily basis by an astronomical level of toxicity, all controlled by these chemical terrorists on behalf of the food industry. Worse is we let them.</p>
<p>How many more toxins will we permit in our food supply before we stand united and simply say “we’ve had enough?” How long will it take until we assertively proclaim that we will not allow any more chemicals or toxins in our foods?</p>
<p>Since food and health regulators cannot properly do their job to protect the public, there will come a tipping point when the people will have to do it for them. We discuss toxic chemicals almost every day, but what percentage of the population is interested enough, curious enough or most of all disciplined enough to actually make the dietary changes necessary to rid all the toxins from the foods they eat? How many people can avoid all processed foods every single day? I would estimate that percentage to be extremely small. Barriers are typically societal pressure, convenience and income. The reality is that we could all have a safe and healthy food industry if we truly wanted it. There are just not enough of us that want it that badly….yet.</p>
<p>Every year or two we have a new chemical terrorist making its way into the food supply almost like clock work. Once the public becomes savvy to the harmful nature of the new toxin, it is then renamed, rebranded and often modified into a deadlier form than its predecessor. <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/10/040810_aminosweet_the_new_aspartame.shtml" target="_blank">Aspartame and aminosweet</a>, and <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/10/091510_hfcs_rename_corn_sugar.shtml" target="_blank">high fructose corn syrup and corn sugar</a> are two excellent examples.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of the biggest offenders that are in more than 80% of the foods we eat.</p>
<p><strong>Artificial Flavors and Colors</strong></p>
<p>Artificial flavors and colors means it is derived from a chemical made in a laboratory and has no nutritional value. Every single artificial flavor and color in the food industry has some kind of detrimental health effect. These include neurotoxicity, organ, developmental, reproductive toxicity and cancer.</p>
<p>* Examples<br />
- Glutamates<br />
- <a href="http://preventdisease.com/home/tips100.shtml">Monosodium Glutamate</a> (MSG)<br />
- Maltodextrin<br />
- Autolyzed Yeast Extract<br />
- Disodium Guanylate<br />
- Disodium Inosinate<br />
- Blue 1, Blue 2<br />
- Yellow 5, Yellow 6<br />
- Red 3, Red 40</p>
<p><strong>Genetically Modified Foods</strong></p>
<p>GM Foods causes allergies, organ damage, cancer, immunotoxicty, and damaging transgenes which affect future generations. Many fruits and vegetables for sale in the U.S. are already genetically modified. The most commercialized GM fruit is papaya from Hawaiiâ€”about half of Hawaii’s papayas are GM.</p>
<p>* Examples<br />
- Corn flour, meal, oil, starch, gluten, and syrup<br />
- Corn Sweeteners such as fructose, dextrose, and glucose<br />
- Modified food starch<br />
- Soy flour, lecithin, protein, isolate, and isoflavone<br />
- Most vegetable oils and vegetable proteins<br />
- Canola oil (also called rapeseed oil)<br />
- Cottonseed oil<br />
- Anything not listed as 100% cane sugar</p>
<p><strong>Toxic Preservatives </strong></p>
<p>Artificial preservatives are responsible for causing a host of health problems pertaining to respiratory tract, heart, blood and other. Some are very neurotoxic especially when combined with specific nutrients.</p>
<p>* Examples<br />
- Antimicrobials<br />
- Nitrites (i.e. Sodium Nitrite)<br />
- Nitrates (i.e. Sodium Nitrate)<br />
- Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)<br />
- Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)<br />
- Sulfites (i.e. Sodium Sulfite)<br />
- Potassium Sorbate<br />
- Benzoic Acid<br />
- Propyl Gallate<br />
- Sodium Benzoate</p>
<p><strong>Toxic Emulsifiers </strong></p>
<p>An emulsifier replaces surface proteins and aids in forming the network in specific food recipes. There are no healthy non-organic emulsifiers. They are all toxic causing everything from infertility, digestive disorders and migraines.</p>
<p>* Examples <strong><br />
</strong>- Polysorbate 80<br />
- Mono-diglycerides<br />
- Carrageenan<br />
- Xanthan Gum (non-organic)<br />
- Guar Gum<br />
- <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/09/073009_soy_lecithin.shtml">Soy Lecithin</a> or Soya Lecithin</p>
<p><strong>Toxic Sweeteners</strong></p>
<p>Sweeteners such as Neotame are thousands of times sweeter than sugar. They are all very potent, neurotoxic, immunotoxic and excitotoxic.</p>
<p>* Examples<br />
- <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/10/031810_aspartame_deadly.shtml" target="_blank">Aspartame</a><br />
- <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/articles/082407_hfcs.shtml">High Fructose Corn Syrup</a><br />
- <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/12/031212_Neotame-13000-Times-Sweeter-Than-Sugar-And-Even-More-Toxic-Than-Aspartame.shtml">Neotame</a><br />
- <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/09/012609_splenda.shtml" target="_blank">Sucralose</a><br />
- <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/12/040412_Canadians-Beware-This-Toxic-Sweetener-Is-Banned-In-The-US-Yet-Approved-in-Canada.shtml" target="_blank">Sodium cyclamate</a><br />
- Acesulfame-K</p>
<p><strong>Toxic Adulterants </strong></p>
<p>Food fraud and economically motivated food adulteration is highlighted by some very toxic substances which cause cancer, glaucoma, digestive and liver disorders. These are added to foods to increase their color, volume or weight.</p>
<p>* Examples<br />
- Metanil Yellow<br />
- Potassium bromate<br />
- Malachite Green<br />
- Tamarind seeds<br />
- Washing powder<br />
- Argemone seeds</p>
<p>This list is by no means extensive. There are now hundreds of toxic additives in our food supply. Chemical terrorism in our food supply must end and it starts with you.</p>
<p>Please look at the ingredient lists before you purchase any processed foods. If you see any of these, don’t buy the product. Continue to educate yourself on the influx of new toxins introduced every year. Eventually, if we investigate enough the answers come. Rule of thumb, if the ingredient list has one chemical or more…it’s one too many.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/GreenHillsSoftware2.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/GreenHillsSoftware2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Around January 21st 1998 a meeting, or series of meetings, took place at Green Hills Software, Inc., between Dan O&#8217;Dowd and Glenn Hightower. The meeting included on their agenda approval of a false stock option agreement to replace the award of shares made to Craig Franklin in 1996.</p>
<p>This was the final step Dan needed to take before exercising the sudden death partnership agreement between himself and Hightower, who had provided the original funding which allowed Green Hills to open its doors in 1982. <a href="http://craigfranklinandgreenhillssoftware.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-personal-and-business-ethics-of.html">More on Hightower</a></p>
<p>Dan had cut a deal with Franklin, agreeing to help him evade characterization of the stock award as marital property in exchange for Franklin&#8217;s assistance to prevent Hightower from exercising his right to buy out the company for 47 million, far less than the approximately 350 million it was actually worth.</p>
<p>Franklin&#8217;s wife, Melinda, had no idea her husband was divorcing her, though later she would find out he had filed the day he returned from their Hawaiian vacation with the entire family of six children on January 1st. It was planned not as a divorce but as take-no-prisoners war.</p>
<p>Melinda had every reason to believe their marriage was stable. The previous year she had saved Craig from the tax disaster his non-filing of returns had caused. He had, in fact, never filed until Melinda forced the issue the previous year when she discovered the reason they were bankrupt was Franklin&#8217;s non-filing.</p>
<p>Other things she did not know came very close to killing her and the couple&#8217;s son, Arthur. <a href="http://howtheneoconsstolefreedom.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-highly-intelligent-psychopath.html">More</a></p>
<p>Hightower found out about the plan just after the meeting during which he was persuaded to sign off on Franklin&#8217;s new share agreement. Dan informed him the sudden death partnership agreement had been exercised.</p>
<p>Shocked, Hightower returned to Pasadena and began to make arrangements to raise the capital. This, he believed, would not be difficult for him. He had started and still owned other companies. He was wrong only because he did not know Craig was to persuade the other vice presidents and critical employees to agree to walk out if he owned Green Hills. Craig did just this the next summer. When the due diligence team came to Green Hills a walk-out occurred. Lavish promises of additional stock and other benefits had been made to the senior personnel. Not all promises were kept, but after the fact there was little they could do about it.</p>
<p>Dan and Craig are both psychopaths. More about them here, <a href="http://rationalreview.news-digests.com/archives/43502">“When psychopaths cooperate”</a></p>
<p>Over the next nearly two years the outcome of the Hightower buyout remained in question because Glenn, outraged by Dan&#8217;s manipulations, which had begun with an restraining order keeping him from making contact with employees, filed a law suit after the orchestrated walk out. <a href="http://justtheevidence.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html">Law suit, Exhibit 7</a> <a href="http://justtheevidence.blogspot.com/2012/12/exhibit-11-morgan-pillsbury-franklin.html">“Morgan Pillsbury – Franklin Transcript”</a></p>
<p>Dan, who has all of the human skills of a piranha, evidently finally realized he needed someone to create a more human face for the corporation. Since Dan hoped to take Green Hills public this should also be someone with an impressive corporate resume able to make affirmative introductions to potentially useful board members, essential to acquiring credibility.<br />
And thus entered a new member for the GHS Team.</p>
<p><strong>John B. Douglas III, Unlikely Addition to the Green Hills Team</strong></p>
<p>Douglas Bio from <a href="http://ghs.com/corporate/management_team.html">Green Hills Site</a></p>
<p>Douglas&#8217; association with Green Hills Software actually began simultaneous with the time Dan was feverishly working to ensure he had the 47 million locked down to buy Green Hills himself. Reading the various and carefully worded resumes which abound on the Internet for Jack you find this phrasing at <a href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=5396854&amp;privcapId=1048479&amp;previousCapId=1200233&amp;previousTitle=Montague%20Partners">Bloomberg Business Week</a>. <em>“Mr. Jack Douglas has been Vice Chairman at Green Hills Software since April 2003. Mr. Douglas served as Chief Executive Officer to obtain multiple forms of debt and equity financing and on other strategic initiatives. Mr. Douglas also acts as a key advisor to other growing companies. ”</em></p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer of what, Green Hills Software, during the time they were attempting to go public? Of course, it could be a mis-statement by an online site which was perpetuated through reposting. But there are other indications money was tight during the period of 1998 – 2003 when Green Hills became a government contractor.</p>
<p>Dan borrowed a million dollars from Dr. Carl Franklin, Craig&#8217;s father, supposedly to pay for Craig&#8217;s stock options. It would have seemed reasonable for Craig to then use the generous dividends being paid from 1998 on to repay this, but evidently this did not happen. The money was extracted from Dan. Craig never repays loans since he has better uses for the money. This has been true his entire life, with only a few exceptions.</p>
<p>This &#8216;loan,&#8217; for what ever reason it was made, was not repaid when expected and only firm action on the part of Dr. Franklin&#8217;s other two sons, Sterling and Larry, both attorneys, resulted in extracting the money from Dan.</p>
<p>Someone with Jack&#8217;s qualifications must have seemed like a dream come true for Dan at the time because along with Jack&#8217;s connections he also brought a far more normal personal manner than either Dan or Craig had to offer as officers of the company.</p>
<p>Also, there was Dan, strapped for money, with Hightower suing and only Craig to provide him with comfort and ideas.</p>
<p>Craig at this time, late 1998 through 1999, had became obsessed with having a hit man kill his wife, according to affidavits given later by those talking to him every day. (<a href="http://justtheevidence.blogspot.com/2012/12/exhibit-20-morgan-pillsbury-gell.html">Affidavit, Middle of Page 2</a>) This came about because Melinda was, like Hightower, not following the carefully scripted plan he and Dan had laid out. She was supposed to die during the divorce from her heart condition, as Hightower was supposed to just go away. Therefore, it is doubtful Dan found their daily lunches together very comforting. Craig&#8217;s public rantings probably made Dan, who is far more cautious, uneasy.</p>

Jack Douglas</div>
<p>Craig looks far more normal here than he actually is. Despite appearances, he is highly intelligent with an I. Q. of 180, making him smarter than Einstein.</p>
<p>Jack not only looks normal, he looks charming, sophisticated, and intelligent. His resume, which includes his graduation, summa cum laude from Harvard Law, speaks for itself. Jack could be depended on not to shock potential investors with his table manners, too, an iffy proposition with Craig.</p>
<p>Additionally, Jack&#8217;s masterful analysis for running an in-house division for corporate counsel, “<em>The Reebok Rules,</em>” is filled with sage advice, some of which Jack might have found useful himself.</p>
<p>Now, what motivated John B. (Jack) Douglas III, to go to work at Green Hills, besides money? Jack had received stock when he was working for Apple and, presumably, his income from the stellar corporations, including Reebok, where he held senior executive positions , “<em>helping Reebok grow to over $3 billion in revenue</em>,” also provided substantial remuneration, as did Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</p>
<p>Each of these jobs seems to have grown shorter in duration. Jack was at Reebok for ten years, the others for far shorter periods, compressed into the time he had also assumed a consulting role with Green Hills.</p>
<p>By all reports, if they are to be believed, it was not any problem with his professional performance which caused him to move on. That leaves personal considerations and, of late, we have had indications all was not normal with Jack&#8217;s personal life.</p>
<p>On April 17th Jack was arrested for committing an act of, “Lewdness, open and gross, c 272 s16 (272/16)” in plain sight of a family seated for a meal at the Olive Garden Restaurant in Taunton, Massachusetts. The father of the children, an off duty police officer immediately confronted Jack, this leading to his arrest and arraignment. The event took place at 3:49pm. The facts are recounted in the <a href="http://justtheevidence.blogspot.com/2013/04/mail-received-by-melinda-pillsbury.html">POLICE REPORT</a>.</p>
<p>Evidently, Jack is an exhibitionist, a form of sexual perversion, “<em>known by several names including: flashing, apodysophilia, and Lady Godiva syndrome, according to <a href="http://www.thriveboston.com/counseling/overcoming-exhibitionism-how-to-stop-exposing-yourself-in-public-flashing-mooning-exposing-genitals-sexual-deviancy/">Thrive Boston</a></em>.</p>
<p>According to the same site ”Some exhibitionists have a conscious desire to shock or upset the person or persons they are exposing themselves to. In contrast, a high percentage of exhibitionists hope or fantasize that the target of their exposure will become sexually aroused and want to engage in sexual activity with them.</p>
<p>In some cases an exhibitionist will masturbate while exposing him or herself.”</p>
<p>The first part of this accords with Jack&#8217;s reported activity.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dhra.mil/perserec/adr/sexualbehav/behaviors2.htm#Exhibitionism">The Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA)</a> site provides the outcome of studies which state male exhibitionists may be sexually inhibited, or even impotent, this starting before age 18 in most cases. Most common in men in their twenties the impulse supposedly diminishes during the 30s and 40s, becoming less common. Another study found, “<em>that the typical exhibitionist is married, has above average intelligence, is satisfactorily employed, and shows no other evidence of serious emotional problems.<a href="http://www.dhra.mil/perserec/adr/sexualbehav/behaviors2.htm#132">132</a> and that,” The absence of other emotional problems has been a consistent finding in a number of studies. <a href="http://www.dhra.mil/perserec/adr/sexualbehav/behaviors2.htm#130">130</a> </em>“</p>
<p>The condition is reported to be treatable and treatment programs are available which lower the rate of recidivism to &#8216;rare.&#8217; Today Jack is entering his sixties, however, making him somewhat unusual for an exhibitionist.</p>
<p>It is therefore unlikely the incident in Taunton was the first time Jack exhibited himself, raising the possibility his changes in employment and frequent changes of address are not unrelated to this condition.</p>
<p>It is conceivable Green Hills provided a safe harbor for Jack because events in his personal life had overcome him. By leaving Millennium and &#8216;hiring on&#8217; at Green Hills he could continue to live in Massachusetts and still have an active professional profile, even if it was one which radically changed his previous, far more prestigious, trajectory.</p>
<p>Also, he did not actually have to live in Santa Barbara and see very much of Dan and Craig. But he knew, through his interactions with them, beginning in 1998, the company would cover for him if questions about his personal life were raised. Dan had certainly provided this service to Craig, who was guilty of raping women in his office during working hours, to say nothing of his after hours activities.</p>
<p>And, given the arrest cited above, it is very likely he knew it would be well to have an understanding and helpful employer.</p>
<p>Despite not inconsiderable research on the web there is actually very little to be found about Jack&#8217;s personal life. Those with which he is associated are better understood as extensions of his professional life.</p>
<p>Unlike his fellow Team members Jeff Hazarian and Jason Issacs, he appears to be uninvolved in his local community in any not-for-profit organization. Hazarian and Issacs both joined Green Hills after the events of 1998 and are in stable marriages. Hazarian is very active in his church. Issacs and his wife contribute and participate in local charities, which other members of the GHS management team, do not appear to do.</p>
<p>In effect, Dan provided a sanctuary for those employees inclined to engage in personally unethical behavior. This became a perk of employment, where it obtained the services of individuals who otherwise would not have tolerated his unwillingness to share profits and a business strategy which included providing weapons used to commit human rights violations around the world.</p>
<p>The score card for the management team can be read like this.</p>
<p>Dan and Craig – Psychopathic.<br />
Dave Kleidermacher and Dave Chandler – Caught by greed and their complicity in Dan&#8217;s 1998 fraud.<br />
Jack – Sexually Deviant, needs assistance in finding an effective treatment program.<br />
Chris Smith – Unknown.<br />
Tim Reed – Cal Tech graduate, still researching.<br />
Jeff and Jason – Tolerant of the corporate culture which financially benefits them.</p>
