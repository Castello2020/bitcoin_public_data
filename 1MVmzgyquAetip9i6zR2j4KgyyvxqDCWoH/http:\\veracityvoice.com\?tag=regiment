<p>A 1928 book entitled “Propaganda” by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernayshttp:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays" target="_blank">Edward Bernays</a> begins with these words. “The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.  Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.”</p>
<p>“We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized.  Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society.”</p>
<p>“Our invisible governors are, in many cases, unaware of the identity of their fellow members in the inner cabinet.”  Pg. 9</p>
<p>He continues: “Some of the phenomena of this process are criticized—the manipulation of news, the inflation of personality, and the general ballyhoo by which politicians and commercial products and social ideas are brought to the consciousness of the masses. The instruments by which public opinion is organized and focused may be misused. But such organization and focusing are necessary to orderly life.”</p>
<p>“As civilization has become more complex, and as the need for invisible government has been increasingly demonstrated, the technical means have been invented and developed by which opinion may be regimented.” Pg. 12</p>
<p>Bernays lived to see a practical application of his ideas in the government of the United States of America.  Born in 1891 he died in 1995 at the age of 103.  His brand of Talmudist humanistic government is the guiding light of our current society.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School" target="_blank">The Frankfort School</a> enhanced Bernays’ totalitarian model with an equally onerous Communism.  With the same geographic German roots Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse, Pollock, Fromm, Lowenthal, and others fled Hitler’s oppressive regime and sang their song of tyranny in American intellectual circles.</p>
<p>Similar authoritarianism were envisioned by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Strauss" target="_blank">University of Chicago professor Leo Strauss</a> whose students included an array of  movers and shakers (Justice Clarence Thomas; Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork; Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz; former Assistant Secretary of State Alan Keyes; former Secretary of Education William Bennett; Weekly Standard editor and former Quayle Chief of Staff William Kristol; Allan Bloom, former New York Post editorials editor John Podhoretz; and former National Endowment for the Humanities Deputy Chairman John T. Agresto) who often damned Constitutional freedoms in favor of war and conquest.</p>
<p>R. J. Rushdoony’s writings emphasize the inevitable development of the tyrannical state as the ultimate authority in humanistic societies.  Instead of deriving order from the immutable dictates of the Creator, humanism leaves the creature with an anarchic, goalless absurdity.  Tyranny is the only solution to mutable human opinion. Governments that evade responsibility to the Creator soon become despotic.</p>
<p>Humanism is not confined to totalitarian governments it is just as prominent and even more deadly in religious organizations.  The Protestant Christian Church began its steep slide with the idea that “free will” allowed the creature to decide whether or not it would accept the Will of the Creator.  Arminianism copies the original sin recorded In Genesis 3. The Bible describes a God Who is sovereign and Who both selects and enables His subjects.  Humanism had grown like a cancer in the Christian Church allowing so called Christians to function as humanists while claiming the Name of Christ.</p>
<p>Several doctrines common in the Catholic Church are equally humanistic.  The Church of Jesus Christ has no authority to forgive sin or to confer salvation; both are reserved to God alone.  The Bible contains no injunction to pray to Mary or to any other human figure the church might designate. This contradicts the Biblical mandate and is blasphemous.</p>
<p>Judaism is rife with human error that began with the Pharisees in the time of Christ and has continued to grow and fester.  God’s Word contained in the Torah has been replaced with the words of men in the Talmud where Rabbis override the voice of the Creator with sly rebuttals and ameliorate sin with absurd excuses.  The apartheid Talmud, a humanistic guide to the Torah, rules the behavior of the powerful U. S. Jewish community.</p>
<p>Sincere subjugation to the Living God and attentive obedience to His Word is anathema to the prideful heathens that control the world.  The arrogance that results from human hegemony is forcing dissonant evil on a world of confused and sinful people.  Homosexuality, gay marriage, abortion, porn, imperialistic war, murder, torture, legal theft, judicial injustice, and rampant mendacity have all become entrenched in our society.</p>
<p>R. J. Rushdoony writes: “The alternative to the sovereignty, government, and providence of the triune God is in practice the sovereignty, government, and providence of church state or some agency of man.  It means freedom from God for the slavery of sin and rebellion.  The man who is in revolt against God’s reign will soon be the slave, not only of sin, but of apostate institutions, churches, states, families , men, women, and children.  For such a slave, freedom is intolerable.  As a young Nazi boasted before WWII, ‘We are free of freedom.’ “   “Systematic Theology” Pg. 211-212</p>
<p>The passage reminded me of my estranged daughter who along with her husband and five grandchildren left the family, sold their home and all their possessions and moved into a cult.  They had a fine marriage and were excellent parents but they struggled to make a living and to find an outlet for their Christianity.</p>
<p>They were always happy to receive help but they regularly ignored advice.  Their failure to cope with the responsibilities of freedom was a product of their own rebellion and now they live and work under the control of others.</p>
<p>Slavery has been demonized in our society but it is not always bad.  There are those who prefer to delegate their freedom and will work for those who assume responsibility.</p>
<p>When Bernays refers to “the masses” he uses an impersonal derogation to describe the population that failed to ascend into the elite structure.  Today, that would be the 99 percent who are under the rule of a shadowy elite one percent.</p>
<p>It is an interesting fact that our Constitution was crafted in secret by a group of leading citizens.  It was designed to provide freedom to the population through rule of the people by the people.  It was a sterling concept but it had a fatal flaw:  Authority was vested in citizens who do not have the ability to properly govern themselves</p>
<p>Governments that are not bound to God’s Law will always become tyrannical.  Libertarians seek a minimum of government intrusion – some seek none.  They come close to the Christian concept which is miniscule.  But since humans were not created to govern themselves they require an overarching authority.  God’s model has the entire creation under His mandates.  His model provides maximum freedom for both the leaders and the people. It offers an absolute legal code that cannot be amended.  Without this immutable anchor for all of God’s creatures tyranny will continue.</p>
<p>“The providence of God is little spoken of today, because His powers of government have been transferred to the state and to man, together with His sovereignty.  It is the stare that today preaches providence to willing congregations, calling it cradle to grave for (or womb to tomb) care, social security, and a variety of other names.  Men everywhere believe in providence, and they look to their gods to it. Unhappily, their gods are false gods, and not the living Lord.”  R. J. Rushdoony  “Systematic Theology”, Vol 1, Pg. 211</p>

<p>Everywhere I go, I meet people who seem to believe that it’s all over, that there is no hope, that freedom is forever doomed. The doom and gloomers are omnipresent. But there is a great line in the newest version of the movie “Red Dawn” that should help put it all in perspective. One of the freedom fighters says, “I’m still breathing so, it’s not over.” I love that line. I feel exactly the same way.</p>
<p>There is no question that the forces of globalism and socialism have pretty much had their way over the past few decades. And with very few exceptions, we don’t have a lot of allies in Washington, D.C., and in most State capitals. For that matter, we don’t have a lot of allies on Wall Street or in most classrooms. But that doesn’t mean that it’s over: not by a long shot.</p>
<p>Freedom didn’t have a majority in 1775 and 1776, either. I doubt that one could find any time in history when the proponents of liberty were ever in a majority. Sam Adams may have said it best when he said, “It does not take a majority to prevail&#8230;but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men.”</p>
<p>However, there is one thing that Colonial America had that modern America doesn’t have: a patriot pulpit. The pulpits of Colonial America were ablaze with the fire of liberty. Colonial clergymen of every Christian denomination explained, extolled, enlightened, expounded, and elucidated the Natural Biblical principles of liberty from their pulpits continuously. Remember that it was mostly the men of Pastor Jonas Clark’s congregation at the Church of Lexington that stood armed on Lexington Green against British troops in the wee morning hours of April 19, 1775, and fired the shot heard ’round the world.</p>
<p>Publisher and historian Gerald Nordskog writes these words about Jonas Clark: “As the pastor of the church at Lexington, he typically gave four sermons a week, written out and orally presented&#8211;nearly 2200 sermons in his lifetime. His preaching was vigorous in style, animated in manner, instructive in matter, and delivered with uncommon energy and zeal, with an agreeable and powerful voice. His sermons were rarely less than an hour, often more.”</p>
<p>Nordskog continues, “It can be regarded only as a singularly happy circumstance that, as Lexington was to be the place where resistance to the power of England was first to occur, and the great act of a declaration of war first to be made by the act of the people in the blood to be there shed, making the place forever famous in history, the minister of Lexington should have been a man of the principles, character, courage, and energy of Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>“It can be regarded he was eminently a man produced by the times&#8211;more than equal to them; rather a guide and leader. All his previous life, his preaching, his intercourse and conversation among his people had been but a continued and most effectual preparation for the noble stand taken by his people on the morning of the 19th of April, 1775. The militia on the Common that morning were the same who filled the pews of the meetinghouse on the Sunday morning before, and the same who hung upon the rear of the retreating enemy in the forenoon and throughout the day. They were only carrying the preaching of many previous years into practice.</p>
<p>“It would not be beyond the truth to assert that there was no person at that time and in that vicinity&#8211;not only no clergyman but no other person of whatever calling or profession, who took a firmer stand for the liberties of the country or was more ready to perform the duties and endure the sacrifices of a patriot, than the minister of Lexington.</p>
<p>“When the struggle actually commenced, the people were ready for it, thoroughly acquainted with the reasons on which the duty of resistance was founded, and prepared to discharge the duty at every hazard. No population within the compass of the Colonies were better prepared for the events of the 19th of April, than the people of Lexington; no people to whom the events of that day could more safely have been entrusted; none more worthy of the duties that fell to their lot; or who better deserved the honours which have followed the faithful performance of them. No single individual probably did so much to educate the people up to that point of intelligence, firmness, and courage, as their honoured and beloved pastor.” (Nordskog, Gerald Christian; The Battle of Lexington; Nordskog Publishing; 2007; Print.)</p>
<p>Can one imagine how history would have been changed had the Church of Lexington, Massachusetts, and all of the churches of Colonial America for that matter, been occupied with the kinds of ministers we have today? I can tell you this: there would have been no Lexington Green and Concord Bridge; no Bunker Hill; no Valley Forge; no Declaration of Independence; no U.S. Constitution; and no United States of America. And that is an absolute fact. The erroneous interpretation of Romans 13, so prevalent today among pastors and churches, would have instructed the colonists that it would be a sin against God to rebel against King George. Pastors would have taught their congregations to be good little slaves to the Crown. Without a doubt, had Colonial America had the kinds of ministers we have today, we would still be a subjected colony of Great Britain to this very hour.</p>
<p>And if you think Jonas Clark was the exception to the rule in Colonial America, you haven’t studied history. Men such as John Witherspoon, James Caldwell, John Peter Muhlenberg, Joab Houghton, Ebenezer Baldwin, Elisha Williams, Charles Chauncy, Jonathan Mayhew, Isaac Backus, Samuel Sherwood, John Fletcher, John Leland, etc., etc, inspired and instructed Christians of all denominations regarding their duties and responsibilities as free men and women under God&#8211;including the duty to free themselves from the yoke of bondage.</p>
<p>So prominent was the role that Presbyterian pastors played in the American Revolution that as news of the rebellion spread throughout England, Horace Walpole told his fellow members of the British Parliament, “There is no use crying about it. Cousin America has run off with a Presbyterian parson, and that is the end of it.” And Presbyterian ministers were not the only ones to rally the church for the cause of independence.</p>
<p>So many Baptist preachers participated in America’s War for Independence that at the conclusion of the war, President George Washington wrote a personal letter to the Baptist people saying, “I recollect with satisfaction that the religious societies of which you are a member have been, throughout America, uniformly and almost unanimously, the firm friends to civil liberty, and the preserving promoters of our glorious Revolution.” It also explains how Thomas Jefferson could write to a Baptist congregation and say, “We have acted together from the origin to the end of a memorable Revolution.” (McDaniel, George White. The People Called Baptists. The Sunday School Board of the Southern Baptist Convention, 1918. Print.)</p>
<p>But it was ministers from all of the Christian denominations who sounded the clarion call for freedom from their pulpits. Writing in the mid-1800s, noted attorney and historian John Wingate Thornton said, “To the Pulpit, the Puritan Pulpit, we owe the moral force which won our independence.”</p>
<p>The patriot pulpit is what Colonial America had that modern America doesn’t have. We lack the “moral force” of that patriot pulpit. For the most part, America’s pastors today are shy, sheepish servants of the state. For the American people to once again muster the courage and conviction to reclaim their liberties requires a revival of the patriot pulpit. As long as Christian people stay seated in the padded pews of these passive pulpits, our nation will continue to plummet into the pit. But this is where the good news begins.</p>
<p>All over the country, tens of thousands of Christians are leaving these timid and cowardly ministers&#8211;even pastors are leaving their timid congregations behind and joining up with freedom-minded believers in brand new independent fellowships.</p>
<p>For example, we have over 800 patriot pastors listed on our Black Regiment web page. These are ministers who are not afraid to identify themselves as a patriot pastor and have asked to be included in the list. I invite you to search the list and see if there is a Black Regiment pastor near you. See it here:</p>

<p>Furthermore, there are thousands of Christians who are leaving these say-nothing churches and starting home churches or are meeting with small groups of believers who also share their love of liberty. In addition, we have hundreds of believers who, because they cannot find a patriot pastor in their community, are tuning into the service at Liberty Fellowship each Sunday afternoon at 2:30 Mountain Time and listening to our messages.</p>

<div><img alt="WWII" src="http://truthstreammedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WWII.jpg" width="586" /></p>
</div>
<p>In October 1944, at age eighteen, I was drafted into the U.S. army. Largely because of the “Battle of the Bulge,” my training was cut short, my furlough was halved, and I was sent overseas immediately. Upon arrival in Le Havre, France, we were quickly loaded into box cars and shipped to the front. When we got there, I was suffering increasingly severe symptoms of mononucleosis, and was sent to a hospital in Belgium. Since mononucleosis was then known as the “kissing disease,” I mailed a letter of thanks to my girlfriend.</p>
<p>By the time I left the hospital, the outfit I had trained with in Spartanburg, South Carolina, was deep inside Germany, so, despite my protests, I was placed in a “repo depot” (replacement depot). I lost interest in the units to which I was assigned, and don’t recall all of them: non-combat units were ridiculed at that time. My separation qualification record states I was mostly with Company C, 14th Infantry Regiment, during my seventeen-month stay in Germany, but I remember being transferred to other outfits also.</p>
<p>In late March or early April 1945, I was sent to guard a POW camp near Andernach along the Rhine. I had four years of high school German, so I was able to talk to the prisoners, although this was forbidden. Gradually, however, I was used as an interpreter and asked to ferret out members of the S.S. (I found none.)</p>
<p>In Andernach about 50,000 prisoners of all ages were held in an open field surrounded by barbed wire. The women were kept in a separate enclosure that I did not see until later. The men I guarded had no shelter and no blankets. Many had no coats. They slept in the mud, wet and cold, with inadequate slit trenches for excrement. It was a cold, wet spring, and their misery from exposure alone was evident.</p>
<p>Even more shocking was to see the prisoners throwing grass and weeds into a tin can containing a thin soup. They told me they did this to help ease their hunger pains. Quickly they grew emaciated. Dysentery raged, and soon they were sleeping in their own excrement, too weak and crowded to reach the slit trenches. Many were begging for food, sickening and dying before our eyes. We had ample food and supplies, but did nothing to help them, including no medical assistance.</p>
<p>Outraged, I protested to my officers and was met with hostility or bland indifference. When pressed, they explained they were under strict orders from “higher up.” No officer would dare do this to 50,000 men if he felt that it was “out of line,” leaving him open to charges. Realizing my protests were useless, I asked a friend working in the kitchen if he could slip me some extra food for the prisoners. He too said they were under strict orders to severely ration the prisoners’ food, and that these orders came from “higher up.” But he said they had more food than they knew what to do with, and would sneak me some.</p>
<p>When I threw this food over the barbed wire to the prisoners, I was caught and threatened with imprisonment. I repeated the “offense,” and one officer angrily threatened to shoot me. I assumed this was a bluff until I encountered a captain on a hill above the Rhine shooting down at a group of German civilian women with his .45 caliber pistol. When I asked, “Why?,” he mumbled, “Target practice,” and fired until his pistol was empty. I saw the women running for cover, but, at that distance, couldn’t tell if any had been hit.</p>
<p>This is when I realized I was dealing with cold-blooded killers filled with moralistic hatred. They considered the Germans subhuman and worthy of extermination; another expression of the downward spiral of racism. Articles in the G.I. newspaper, <i>Stars and Stripes</i>, played up the German concentration camps, complete with photos of emaciated bodies. This amplified our self-righteous cruelty, and made it easier to imitate behavior we were supposed to oppose. Also, I think, soldiers not exposed to combat were trying to prove how tough they were by taking it out on the prisoners and civilians.</p>
<p>These prisoners, I found out, were mostly farmers and workingmen, as simple and ignorant as many of our own troops. As time went on, more of them lapsed into a zombie-like state of listlessness, while others tried to escape in a demented or suicidal fashion, running through open fields in broad daylight towards the Rhine to quench their thirst. They were mowed down.</p>
<p>Some prisoners were as eager for cigarettes as for food, saying they took the edge off their hunger. Accordingly, enterprising G.I. “Yankee traders” were acquiring hordes of watches and rings in exchange for handfuls of cigarettes or less. When I began throwing cartons of cigarettes to the prisoners to ruin this trade, I was threatened by rank-and-file G.I.s too.</p>
<p>The only bright spot in this gloomy picture came one night when. I was put on the “graveyard shift,” from two to four a.m. Actually, there was a graveyard on the uphill side of this enclosure, not many yards away. My superiors had forgotten to give me a flashlight and I hadn’t bothered to ask for one, disgusted as I was with the whole situation by that time. It was a fairly bright night and I soon became aware of a prisoner crawling under the wires towards the graveyard. We were supposed to shoot escapees on sight, so I started to get up from the ground to warn him to get back. Suddenly I noticed another prisoner crawling from the graveyard back to the enclosure. They were risking their lives to get to the graveyard for something. I had to investigate.</p>
<p>When I entered the gloom of this shrubby, tree-shaded cemetery, I felt completely vulnerable, but somehow curiosity kept me moving. Despite my caution, I tripped over the legs of someone in a prone position. Whipping my rifle around while stumbling and trying to regain composure of mind and body, I soon was relieved I hadn’t reflexively fired. The figure sat up. Gradually, I could see the beautiful but terror-stricken face of a woman with a picnic basket nearby. German civilians were not allowed to feed, nor even come near the prisoners, so I quickly assured her I approved of what she was doing, not to be afraid, and that I would leave the graveyard to get out of the way.</p>
<p>I did so immediately and sat down, leaning against a tree at the edge of the cemetery to be inconspicuous and not frighten the prisoners. I imagined then, and still do now, what it would be like to meet a beautiful woman with a picnic basket under those conditions as a prisoner. I have never forgotten her face.</p>
<p>Eventually, more prisoners crawled back to the enclosure. I saw they were dragging food to their comrades, and could only admire their courage and devotion.</p>
<p>On May 8, V.E. Day [1945], I decided to celebrate with some prisoners I was guarding who were baking bread the other prisoners occasionally received. This group had all the bread they could eat, and shared the jovial mood generated by the end of the war. We all thought we were going home soon, a pathetic hope on their part. We were in what was to become the French zone [of occupation], where I soon would witness the brutality of the French soldiers when we transferred our prisoners to them for their slave labor camps.</p>
<p>On this day, however, we were happy.</p>
<p>As a gesture of friendliness, I emptied my rifle and stood it in the corner, even allowing them to play with it at their request. This thoroughly “broke the ice,” and soon we were singing songs we taught each other, or that I had learned in high school German class (“Du, du, liegst mir im Herzen”). Out of gratitude, they baked me a special small loaf of sweet bread, the only possible present they had left to offer. I stuffed it in my “Eisenhower jacket,” and snuck it back to my barracks, eating it when I had privacy. I have never tasted more delicious bread, nor felt a deeper sense of communion while eating it. I believe a cosmic sense of Christ (the Oneness of all Being) revealed its normally hidden presence to me on that occasion, influencing my later decision to major in philosophy and religion.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, some of our weak and sickly prisoners were marched off by French soldiers to their camp. We were riding on a truck behind this column. Temporarily, it slowed down and dropped back, perhaps because the driver was as shocked as I was. Whenever a German prisoner staggered or dropped back, he was hit on the head with a club and killed. The bodies were rolled to the side of the road to be picked up by another truck. For many, this quick death might have been preferable to slow starvation in our “killing fields.”</p>
<p>When I finally saw the German women held in a separate enclosure, I asked why we were holding them prisoner. I was told they were “camp followers,” selected as breeding stock for the S.S. to create a super-race. I spoke to some, and must say I never met a more spirited or attractive group of women. I certainly didn’t think they deserved imprisonment.</p>
<p>More and more I was used as an interpreter, and was able to prevent some particularly unfortunate arrests. One somewhat amusing incident involved an old farmer who was being dragged away by several M.P.s. I was told he had a “fancy Nazi medal,” which they showed me. Fortunately, I had a chart identifying such medals. He’d been awarded it for having five children! Perhaps his wife was somewhat relieved to get him “off her back,” but I didn’t think one of our death camps was a fair punishment for his contribution to Germany. The M.P.s agreed and released him to continue his “dirty work.”</p>
<p>Famine began to spread among the German civilians also. It was a common sight to see German women up to their elbows in our garbage cans looking for something edible — that is, if they weren’t chased away.</p>
<p>When I interviewed mayors of small towns and villages, I was told that their supply of food had been taken away by “displaced persons” (foreigners who had worked in Germany), who packed the food on trucks and drove away. When I reported this, the response was a shrug. I never saw any Red Cross at the camp or helping civilians, although their coffee and doughnut stands were available everywhere else for us. In the meantime, the Germans had to rely on the sharing of hidden stores until the next harvest.</p>
<p>Hunger made German women more “available,” but despite this, rape was prevalent and often accompanied by additional violence. In particular I remember an eighteen-year old woman who had the side of her faced smashed with a rifle butt, and was then raped by two G.I.s. Even the French complained that the rapes, looting and drunken destructiveness on the part of our troops was excessive. In Le Havre, we’d been given booklets warning us that the German soldiers had maintained a high standard of behavior with French civilians who were peaceful, and that we should do the same. In this we failed miserably.</p>
<p>“So what?” some would say. “The enemy’s atrocities were worse than ours.” It is true that I experienced only the end of the war, when we were already the victors. The German opportunity for atrocities had faded, while ours was at hand. But two wrongs don’t make a right. Rather than copying our enemy’s crimes, we should aim once and for all to break the cycle of hatred and vengeance that has plagued and distorted human history. This is why I am speaking out now, 45 years after the crime. We can never prevent individual war crimes, but we can, if enough of us speak out, influence government policy. We can reject government propaganda that depicts our enemies as subhuman and encourages the kind of outrages I witnessed. We can protest the bombing of civilian targets, which still goes on today. And we can refuse ever to condone our government’s murder of unarmed and defeated prisoners of war.</p>
<p>I realize it’s difficult for the average citizen to admit witnessing a crime of this magnitude, especially if implicated himself. Even G.I.s sympathetic to the victims were afraid to complain and get into trouble, they told me. And the danger has not ceased. Since I spoke out a few weeks ago, I have received threatening calls and had my mailbox smashed. But its been worth it. Writing about these atrocities has been a catharsis of feelings suppressed too long, a liberation, that perhaps will remind other witnesses that “the truth will make us free, have no fear.” We may even learn a supreme lesson from all this: only love can conquer all.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/megachurchnorth3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/megachurchnorth2.jpg" align="left" /></a>At some point, one has to wonder why America’s churches are the largest block of irrelevant, impotent, and insignificant institutions in the entire country. And make no mistake about it: when it comes to influencing societal conditions, culture, and the political philosophy of the nation, for all intents and purposes, they ARE irrelevant, impotent, and insignificant.</p>
<p>Think about it: according to the latest available statistics, over 75% of America’s adults classify themselves as Christians. That’s over 159 million people. Over 43% of America’s adults attend the more than 300,000 churches regularly. That’s over 90 million people. Yes, both of these statistics are WAY DOWN from just a few years ago, but those statistics still represent a HUGE block of the American population. So why do these Christians and churches have so very little influence in America’s society, culture, and politics? Asking it bluntly, why is America going to hell in a handbasket with all of these churches dotting the landscape?</p>
<p>There is no mistaking the fact that from before the American Revolution, after the American Revolution, throughout the Eighteenth and Nineteenth centuries, and through the first half of the Twentieth Century, the American Church was a major voice and influence in virtually every facet and sphere of American society. However, with the exception of a temporary resurgence in the 1980s, the influence of the Church in the last half of the Twentieth Century and continuing now into the Twenty First Century is nada. Zilch.</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, the activist arm of conservative churches, the Religious Right, Christian Coalition, Moral Majority, call it what you will, is clinically dead. It is not comatose; it is dead. When it comes to influencing the culture and politics of the nation, the modern Church is dead. Pastors are dead. Denominations are dead. Christian schools and universities are dead.</p>
<p>Think of it: 159 million Christians, 90 million churchgoers, and 300,000 churches cannot effectively influence even the smallest change of direction in America’s society, culture, and political philosophy. America is in a societal, economic, and political tailspin, and the Church sits irrelevant and impotent. And don’t forget: we are not talking about an enslaved, oppressed country such as communist China where millions of Christians are forced at gunpoint to submit to the machinations of the state.</p>
<p>While it is true that the underground church in China (the REAL church in China) is seeing great growth, without a revolution such as America experienced in the late 1700s, Chinese Christians will never be able to effect societal and political change in that country. And, of course, the communist government in China has all but guaranteed that such a revolution will not take place by completely disarming the citizenry.</p>
<p>In America, we are talking about a nation in which citizens (including Christians) are able to lobby, redress government, protest, rally, organize opposition, speak, vote, form PACs, march, petition, etc. Christians are as free to influence their societies and governments as are any other group of people in the United States. Furthermore, name the other group in this country that can boast 75% of the population who identify with it in name or 43% of the population who regularly attend its public meetings? What would the country look like if the ACLU could boast these numbers? Or the SPLC? Or labor unions?</p>
<p>Labor unions comprise only 11% of the adult workforce. The ACLU membership is reported to be about 500,000. And, of course, the people who belong to the SPLC could fit in a phone booth. By comparison, these groups comprise a miniscule percentage of the population as opposed to America’s churches, yet their influence is exponentially greater. So, what has happened?</p>
<p>The great Nineteenth Century revivalist and major contributor to America’s Second Great Awakening, Charles Finney, said this: “Christians must vote for honest men and take consistent ground in politics. God cannot sustain this free and blessed country, which we love and pray for, unless the Church will take right ground. Politics are a part of a religion in such a country as this, and Christians (and citizens) must do their duty to the country as a part of their duty to God. It seems sometimes as if the foundations of the nation are becoming rotten, and Christians seem to act as if they think God does not see what they do in politics.”</p>
<p>Finney also said, &#8220;If there is a decay of conscience, the pulpit is responsible for it. If the public press lacks moral discernment, the pulpit is responsible for it. If the church is degenerate and worldly, the pulpit is responsible for it. If the world loses its interest in Christianity, the pulpit is responsible for it. If Satan rules in our halls of legislation, the pulpit is responsible for it. If our politics become so corrupt that the very foundations of our government are ready to fall away, the pulpit is responsible for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is no hyperbole to say that, on the whole, the American Church has been mostly ineffective since immediately after World War II. The Church sat mute when God was expelled from America’s public life in the 1960s. It sat mute when the government gave license to the premeditated murder of preborn babies in the 1970s. And today it continues to sit mute in the face of a burgeoning police state. There seems to be virtually no abridgment of liberty, no national scandal, or no threat against our constitutional form of government egregious enough to warrant an outcry from America’s pastors and churches.</p>
<p>For the most part, today’s pastors are not prophets and watchmen; they are cheerleaders and CEOs. Our churches are not “the pillar and ground of the truth” (I Timothy 3:15 KJV); they are centers of social interaction, recreation, and feel-good indoctrination. Preachers are not reprovers, rebukers, and exhorters (II Timothy 4:2); they are ear-ticklers, entertainers, and expositors of irrelevance.</p>
<p>Let me ask you: what good does it do to teach the stories of Daniel and the lions’ den, and the three Hebrew children in the burning fiery furnace, and Esther, and John the Baptist, and Elijah, and Simon Peter saying, “We must obey God rather than men,” and Samson, and Gideon, etc., ad infinitum, if you are not going to apply those stories to the practical, day-to-day events we are experiencing now? What good does it do to preach expository messages on the Bible if one does not make those messages relevant to the times and circumstances in which we live? Yet, ear-tickling, entertainment, and irrelevant exposition seem to be what the modern church in America excels in. The result: ineffective, impotent, weak, unprepared, and sheepish Christians.</p>
<p>Yes, I know there are many churches and Christian ministries that are doing admirable work. We need homeless shelters, food banks, pregnancy resource centers, addiction ministries, etc. We most definitely need pastors and churches to preach the Gospel of Christ. We need missionary outreach. But we also need pastors and churches to teach the Biblical Natural Law principles of liberty and to prepare their congregations to guard and defend our freedom.</p>
<p>I tell you the truth: Christians in persecuted lands are not enamored with entertainment, recreation, and irrelevant Bible exposition. You don’t have to bring in some big-name rock band to entice them to fellowship. You don’t have to give their teenagers a big gymnasium. You don’t have to give their young adults coffee shops and espresso machines. You don’t have to shy away from criticisms of tyrannical government. And you certainly are not going to score any points with your fallacious “obey-the-government-no-<wbr></wbr>matter-what” interpretation of Romans 13.</p>
<p>The time is soon coming in this country when it is going to “rain on the just and on the unjust.” (Matthew 5:45 KJV) Mark it down, Christian: when persecution and tribulation comes to America (and it has already begun), you and your family will NOT be exempt. When a jetliner falls out of the sky, everyone in it (Christian or not) goes down with the plane. And when a nation falls, everyone in it (Christian or not) goes down with the country.</p>
<p>The church was not created to teach Christian sugars how to recreate on a playground, but to teach Christian soldiers how to fight on a battlefield.</p>
<p>So many of our Christian brothers and sisters seem to be literally enslaved or addicted to some form of church formality. They need a certain music fix, or entertainment fix, or teaching fix, or liturgical fix, or a hundred other fixes. They demand a certain delivery, a certain style, or a certain personality. They intend to do nothing with what they hear, but it makes them feel good hearing it. The carnality, rancor, envy, and meanness inside the church is equal to, or superior to, that which is outside the church. Many Christian businessmen are just as greedy, just as dishonest, and just as duplicitous as businessmen professing no faith. Many deacons and church officers are just as untruthful and cowardly as anyone in the outside world.</p>
<p>What have all of these Sunday School lessons done for us? What have all of these pacifist expositional messages done for us? What have all of these gymnasiums, youth programs, self-esteem classes, and counseling centers done for us? Pastors and churches have been teaching all forms of Bible prophecy for decades. Generations of Christians have come and gone arguing over the nuances of Eschatology. What good has it done us? While we have been playing, partying, prancing, promoting, pouting, pontificating, patronizing, and philosophizing, a fire has been burning the foundations of our country; and we have not lifted a pail of water to help extinguish the inferno.</p>
<p>Truly did the Lord Jesus say, “Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.” (Matthew 5:13 KJV)</p>
<p>The word “savour” here means “saltiness.” Salt is a preservative that retards decay and ruination. God has sprinkled “salt” in the form of Christian people all over the country. We are here to be a preservative and protection against rot and ruin. But when Christians lose their saltiness, Jesus said, they are “good for nothing” and are destined to be “trodden under foot of men.” That is a word description of tyranny and oppression. Can anyone say Jackboot?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many pastors and churches today are “good for nothing.” They have lost their saltiness; they no longer preserve and protect. And, ladies and gentlemen, the Jackboots have gotten out the shoe polish as we speak.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter that America has 300,000 churches, 90 million people attending those churches, and 159 million people calling themselves Christians unless those churches and Christians are actively and tenaciously preserving and protecting the foundations and pillars upon which both the church and the country are built.</p>
<p>As God pruned Gideon’s army down from 32,000 to 300, so, too, God may need to prune the Church in America. Let the majority of churches rot on the vine; let them intoxicate themselves on the opiate of entertainment and feelgoodism; let the hirelings in the pulpit lust after ease and social acceptance; let the willfully blind bask in their ignorance; and let the sheepish servants in the sanctuary lick the hands of their oppressors.</p>
<p>Those who choose to fight with Gideon’s army, leave these fancy churches, which are nothing more than ornate tombs, and run to the sound of battle! Gideon’s captains are strategically placed all around the mountains. Join them! God has never needed a majority to prevail; He never will.</p>
<p>The great Christian patriot and “Father of the American Revolution,” Sam Adams, said, “It does not require a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority keen to set brush fires in the people’s minds.”</p>
<p>Let the majority of churches be irrelevant, impotent, and insignificant. Even now, God is raising up unconventional fellowships. A fire for liberty churches is ablaze in the hearts of millions of Americans. The establishment churches are dead; shake off the dust of your feet and move on. Already, we have over 700 patriot pastors and churches that appear on our Black Regiment web page. There may be one near you.</p>

<p>The 4th of July should be a day of historic retrospection. For a proper understanding into the significance of the birth of the nation, start with an examination of the perennial <a href="http://batr.org/">BREAKING ALL THE RULES</a> essay, <a href="http://batr.org/autonomy/070405.html">The Meaning of Independence Day</a>. Then contrast our circumstances and heritage in the article - <a href="http://batr.org/reactionary/070311.html">Independence Day for Whom?</a> Both of these columns are essential. If one forgets from where, how and why our country was created, it is impossible to appreciate the uniqueness of the American Revolution and the meaning of the &#8220;<em>shot heard ‘round the world</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p>A provoking account of <a href="http://www.citizensamericaparty.org/happiness.htm">The Original and Real Cause of the American Revolution</a> - What They Really Fought For, presents the following historical story, taken from a radio address given by Congressman Charles G. Binderup of Nebraska, some 50 years ago and reprinted in <a href="http://openlibrary.org/books/OL6452000M/Unrobing_the_ghosts_of_Wall_street">Unrobing the Ghosts of Wall Street:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Before the American War for Independence in 1776, the colonized part of what is today the United States of America was a possession of England. It was called New England, and was made up of 13 colonies, which became the first 13 states of the great Republic. Around 1750, this New England was very prosperous. Benjamin Franklin was able to write:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There was abundance in the Colonies, and peace was reigning on every border. It was difficult, and even impossible, to find a happier and more prosperous nation on all the surface of the globe. Comfort was prevailing in every home. The people, in general, kept the highest moral standards, and education was widely spread.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When Benjamin Franklin went over to England to represent the interests of the Colonies, he saw a completely different situation: the working population of this country was gnawed by hunger and poverty. &#8220;The streets are covered with beggars and tramps,&#8221; he wrote. He asked his English friends how England, with all its wealth, could have so much poverty among its working classes.</p>
<p>His friends replied that England was a prey to a terrible condition: it had too many workers! The rich said they were already overburdened with taxes, and could not pay more to relieve the needs and poverty of this mass of workers. Several rich Englishmen of that time actually believed, along with Mathus, that wars and plague were necessary to rid the country from man-power surpluses.</p>
<p>Franklin&#8217;s friends then asked him how the American Colonies managed to collect enough money to support their poor houses, and how they could overcome this plague of pauperism. Franklin replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have no poor houses in the Colonies; and if we had some, there would be nobody to put in them, since there is, in the Colonies, not a single unemployed person, neither beggars nor tramps.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>His friends could not believe their ears, and even less understand this fact, since when the English poor houses and jails became too cluttered, England shipped these poor wretches and down-and- outs, like cattle, and discharged, on the quays of the Colonies, those who had survived the poverty, dirtiness and privations of the journey. At that time, England was throwing into jail those who could not pay their debts. They therefore asked Franklin how he could explain the remarkable prosperity of the New England Colonies. Franklin replied:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;That is simple. In the Colonies, we issue our own paper money. It is called &#8216;Colonial Scrip.&#8217; We issue it in proper proportion to make the goods pass easily from the producers to the consumers.  In this manner, creating ourselves our own paper money, we control its purchasing power and we have no interest to pay to no one.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The central struggle that has plagued the fledgling country between true independence and a spin off version of British mercantilism has persisted since 1776. <a href="http://batr.org/autonomy/121204.html">In the beginning: Let there be the Articles of Confederation</a> presents the background on the fundamental reason for fighting the American Revolution; namely, independence &#8211; the essence of <a href="http://batr.org/autonomy/index.html">Inherent Autonomy</a>. The <a href="http://batr.org/view/122602.html">Articles of Confederation was Preferable</a> argues, &#8220;Only a systemic dismantling of that central government, returning primacy back to individual states will restore the vision of the American Revolution&#8221;.</p>
<p>The conflict between the Federalists supremacy of Alexander Hamilton and the vision of <a href="http://batr.org/solitary/090503.html">Thomas Jefferson’s Revolution</a>, has continued to this day. &#8220;Jefferson’s passion for a restrained central government was a core principle foreseen as a primary reason for separation from England. His concept of an independent and self-reliant society was abandoned with the rush to regiment a flawed national identity&#8221;.Deplorably, the Federalists took control and forced their replica model of central government despotism upon a disjointed society. Andrew Jackson is an America hero because he opposed a fiat currency, issued by a National Bank, and an all-powerful central government. Compare his legacy to the archetype tyrant Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>The brilliant thinker, Thomas DiLorenzo in his account, <a href="http://lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo259.html">Why Neocons Are Freaking Out Over Lincoln</a>, makes a contemporary analogy that illustrates the betrayal of the spirit of the American Revolution. The conquest of vicious tyranny, institutionalized with the union victory in the &#8220;<a href="http://iahushua.com/hist/lincoln.html">War of Northern Aggression</a>&#8220;, has ruled ever since.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;One of the clearest examples of the importance the neocons assign to the Lincoln legend in supporting never-ending war is a small book by an American Enterprise Institute neocon named Walter Berns. His book is entitled Making Patriots. In an important chapter on Lincoln mythology Berns bemoans the fact that too many of today’s youth are too hesitant to join in the neocons’ crusades to overthrow governments in place like Syria, Lebanon, Iran, North Korea, and elsewhere. They are too selfish and self-centered, says Berns, being so preoccupied with their own education, careers, and families. They must be mesmerized into the fascist/neocon militaristic mindset by some kind of &#8220;national poet,&#8221; says Walter Berns. &#8220;Fortunately,&#8221; he says, we already have such a &#8220;poet&#8221; in the political rhetoric of Abraham Lincoln. &#8220;Making Cannon Fodder&#8221; would thus be a more appropriate title for Berns’ book.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The egomaniacal presidencies of Theodore Roosevelt, Woodward Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, all fermented an internationalist empire, is the antithesis of the original purpose of the founding of the country.</p>
<p>Independence is dead, because the nation is no longer a republic of sovereign states. Even those who dismiss the superiority of the Articles of Confederation and proclaim primary allegiance to the U.S. Constitution must concede that the &#8220;Bill of Rights&#8221; no longer exists.</p>
<p>In its place is a system of bureaucratic treason dominated by the power of fiat debt money. That &#8220;<em>happier and more prosperous nation on all the surface of the globe&#8221; </em>now reduced to a society where<em> </em>&#8221; <em>The streets are covered with beggars and tramps</em>&#8220;, has no sensible reason to celebrate the imperium regime.</p>
<p>The End of Independence Day is upon us. However, our solemnization of the American Revolution remains.</p>
<p>The traditional conservative America First populism that is our heritage goes unheeded by most citizenry. It seems illogical that people will continually endorse or even give rudimentary support to a system that is lethally hostile to individual liberty. Nonetheless, that is exactly the state of affairs that we live underneath, with no reasonable expectation of altering constitutionally.</p>
<p>Independence, both personal and juristically are tagged as terrorist defiance. Accountability of arrogant autocrats goes unpunished.</p>
<p>An American <a href="http://batr.org/reactionary/031306.html">Renaissance Revolution</a> is the solution. &#8220;In order to fulfill the objectives of 1776, the original conflict must finish the task that was never completed. Western Civilization is worth saving. Our true cultural heritage must survive. And secular humanism needs to be cast into the pit of hell fire.&#8221;Can you afford many more years of betrayal? The 1776 declaration stands for liberty.</p>
<p>The commentary, <a href="http://batr.org/autonomy/111104.html">No Despotism &#8211; Only Independence</a> espouses the case for self-rule.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The answer to defeat despotism is found in the revelation of INDEPENDENCE. While not a perfect guarantee for victory or a formula to replace a fallen human nature; autonomy among your own similar kind, is the inherent right for governance. Independence is the antidote to despotic corruption. Relief from mob lunacy, under the domination of gangster direction, is found in the model of an authentic Republic.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Regular readers are familiar with numerous examples of government subversion. Any bystander intuitively knows that the system no longer works for the average American. However, countless citizens still want to cheer for a government that long ago forfeited any legitimacy. How strange a society that champions wars and plague as necessary to rid the country from man-power surpluses. What has changed among the Lordly elites from the colonial era?</p>
<p>It is ironic that Congressman <a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=B000466">Charles G. Binderup</a> emigrated with his parents from Denmark, understood the nature of the American experience, while legions of government-schooled clones are so clueless.The globalists that control the political apparatus are dedicated anti-liberty fascists. The corporatists of today are English Crown Tory descendants, no matter their origin. The death lyric of independence is the choir in the requiem hymn of the Republic. Ben Franklin’s jubilate assessment, has witnessed the methodical destruction of the spirit of Independence Day with each succeeding year.</p>

				<p>April 20, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17319#comments" title="Comment on The Man Who Fired The Shot Heard ’Round The World"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="17319 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17319">1 Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
			</div>
		
			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Standt3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Standt2.jpg" align="left" /></a>In II Samuel 19 there is the story about an often-overlooked man by the name of Barzillai. He was a Gileadite who helped save King David’s life. The Scripture says of him: “He was a very great man.” Today, I’m going to tell you about a very great man. In fact, I’m going to talk about several great men.</p>
<p>I am reminded of these men, because tomorrow I have the distinct honor of speaking at a giant freedom rally on Lexington Green, Massachusetts, on the occasion of the 238th anniversary of the famous Battle of Lexington and Concord. If you live within driving distance, please come and join us. Oath Keepers founder, Stewart Rhodes, will also be speaking at this event. I believe the rally begins at 2pm local time.</p>
<p>In truth, April 19, 1775, should be regarded as important a date to Americans as July 4, 1776. It’s a shame that we don’t celebrate it as enthusiastically as we do Independence Day. It’s even more shameful that many Americans don’t even remember what happened on this day back in 1775. For the record, historians call this day, “Patriot’s Day.” More specifically, it was the day that the shot heard ’round the world was fired. It was the day America’s War for Independence began.</p>
<p>Being warned of approaching British troops by Dr. Joseph Warren and Paul Revere, Pastor Jonas Clark and his male congregants of the Church of Lexington (numbering 60-70) were the ones that stood with their muskets in front of the Crown’s troops (numbering over 800), who were on orders to seize a cache of arms which were stored at Concord and arrest Sam Adams and John Hancock (who were known to be in the area, and who had actually taken refuge in Pastor Clark’s home).</p>
<p>According to eyewitnesses, the king’s troops opened fire on the militiamen without warning, immediately killing eight of Pastor Clark’s parishioners. In self defense, the Minutemen returned fire. These were the first shots of the Revolutionary War. This took place on Lexington Green, which was located directly beside the church-house where those men worshipped each Sunday. Adams and Hancock were not apprehended. A few of Pastor Clark’s men led them to safety as their Christian brothers were preparing to stand in front of the British troops. Sam Adams and John Hancock owed their lives to Pastor Clark and his brave Minutemen.</p>
<p>According to Pastor Clark, these are the names of the eight men who died on Lexington Green as the sun rose on April 19, 1775: Robert Munroe, Jonas Parker, Samuel Hadley, Jonathan Harrington, Jr., Isaac Muzzy, Caleb Harrington, and John Brown, all of Lexington, and one Mr. Porter of Woburn.</p>
<p>However, by the time the British troops arrived at the Concord Bridge, hundreds of colonists had amassed a defense of the bridge. A horrific battle took place, and the British troops were routed and soon retreated back to Boston. America’s War for Independence had begun!</p>
<p>Yes, ladies and gentlemen, these two elements of American history are lost to the vast majority of historians today: 1) it was the attempted gun confiscation and seizure of two patriot leaders by British troops that ignited America’s War for Independence; and, 2) it was a local church pastor and his male congregants that mostly comprised the Minutemen who fired the shots that started our great Revolution.</p>
<p>With that thought in mind, I want to devote today’s column to honoring the brave preachers of Colonial America–these “children of the Pilgrims,” as one colonial pastor’s descendent put it.</p>
<p>It really wasn’t that long ago. However, with the way America’s clergymen act today, one would think that preachers such as James Caldwell, John Peter Muhlenberg, Joab Houghton, and Jonas Clark never existed. But they did exist; and without them, this country we call the United States of America would not exist.</p>
<p>Caldwell was a Presbyterian; Muhlenberg was a Lutheran; Houghton was a Baptist; and no one really seems to know what denomination (if any) Jonas Clark claimed, although one historian referred to Clark as a Trinitarian and Calvinist. But these men had one thing in common (besides their faith in Jesus Christ): they were all ardent patriots who participated in America’s War for Independence, and in the case of Jonas Clark, actually ignited it.</p>
<p><strong>James Caldwell</strong></p>
<p>James Caldwell was called “The Rebel High Priest” or “The Fighting Chaplain.” Caldwell is most famous for the “Give ’em Watts!” story.</p>
<p>During the Springfield (New Jersey) engagement, the Colonial militia ran out of wadding for their muskets. Quickly, Caldwell mounted his horse and galloped to the Presbyterian church, and returning with an armload of hymnals, threw them to the ground, and hollered, “Now, boys, give ’em Watts!” He was referring to the famous hymn writer, Isaac Watts, of course.</p>
<p>The British hated Caldwell so much, they murdered his wife, Hannah, in her own home, as she sat with her children on her bed. Later, a fellow American was bribed by the British to assassinate Pastor Caldwell–which is exactly what he did. Americans loyal to the Crown burned both his house and church. No less than three cities and two public schools in the State of New Jersey bear his name.</p>
<p><strong>John Peter Muhlenberg</strong></p>
<p>John Peter Muhlenberg was pastor of a Lutheran church in Woodstock, Virginia, when hostilities erupted between Great Britain and the American colonies. When news of Bunker Hill reached Virginia, Muhlenberg preached a sermon from Ecclesiastes 3 to his congregation. He reminded his parishioners that there was a time to preach and a time to fight. He said that, for him, the time to preach was past and it was time to fight. He then threw off his vestments and stood before his congregants in the uniform of a Virginia colonel.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg was later promoted to brigadier-general in the Continental Army, and then to major general. He participated in the battles of Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and Yorktown. He went on to serve in both the US House of Representatives and US Senate.</p>
<p><strong>Joab Houghton</strong></p>
<p>Joab Houghton was in the Hopewell (New Jersey) Baptist Meeting House at worship when he received the first information regarding the battles at Lexington and Concord. His great-grandson gives the following eloquent description of the way he treated the tidings:</p>
<p>“[M]ounting the great stone block in front of the meeting-house, he beckoned the people to stop. Men and women paused to hear, curious to know what so unusual a sequel to the service of the day could mean. At the first, words a silence, stern as death, fell over all. The Sabbath quiet of the hour and of the place was deepened into a terrible solemnity. He told them all the story of the cowardly murder at Lexington by the royal troops; the heroic vengeance following hard upon it; the retreat of Percy; the gathering of the children of the Pilgrims round the beleaguered hills of Boston; then pausing, and looking over the silent throng, he said slowly, ‘Men of New Jersey, the red coats are murdering our brethren of New England! Who follows me to Boston?’ And every man in that audience stepped out of line, and answered, ‘I!’ There was not a coward or a traitor in old Hopewell Baptist Meeting-House that day.” (Cathcart, William. Baptists and the American Revolution. Philadelphia: S.A. George, 1876, rev. 1976. Print.)</p>
<p><strong>Jonas Clark</strong></p>
<p>As I said at the beginning of this column, Jonas Clark was pastor of the Church of Lexington, Massachusetts, on April 19, 1775, the day that British troops marched on Concord with orders to arrest Sam Adams and John Hancock, and to seize a cache of firearms. It was Pastor Clark’s male congregants who were the first ones to face-off against the British troops as they marched through Lexington. When you hear the story of the Minutemen at the Battle of Lexington, remember those Minutemen were mostly Pastor Jonas Clark and the men of his congregation.</p>
<p>On the One Year Anniversary of the Battle of Lexington, Clark preached a sermon based upon his eyewitness testimony of the event. He called his sermon, “The Fate of Blood-Thirsty Oppressors and God’s Tender Care of His Distressed People.” His sermon has been republished by Nordskog Publishing under the title, “The Battle of Lexington, A Sermon and Eyewitness Narrative, Jonas Clark, Pastor, Church of Lexington.”</p>
<p>Order the book containing Clark’s sermon at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nordskogpublishing.com/book-lexington.shtml" target="_blank">“The Battle of Lexington, A Sermon and Eyewitness Narrative, Jonas Clark, Pastor, Church of Lexington”</a></p>
<p>Of course, these four brave preachers were not the only ones to participate in America’s fight for independence. There were Episcopalian ministers such as Dr. Samuel Provost of New York, Dr. John Croes of New Jersey, and Robert Smith of South Carolina. Presbyterian ministers such as Adam Boyd of North Carolina and James Armstrong of Maryland, along with many others, also took part.</p>
<p>Numerous Baptist preachers participated in America’s War for Independence, so many that at the conclusion of the war, President George Washington wrote a personal letter to the Baptist people saying, “I recollect with satisfaction that the religious societies of which you are a member have been, throughout America, uniformly and almost unanimously, the firm friends to civil liberty, and the preserving promoters of our glorious Revolution.” It also explains how Thomas Jefferson could write to a Baptist congregation and say, “We have acted together from the origin to the end of a memorable Revolution.” (McDaniel, George White. The People Called Baptists. The Sunday School Board of the Southern Baptist Convention, 1918. Print.)</p>
<p>And although not every pastor was able to actively participate in our fight for independence, because so many pastors throughout colonial America preached the principles of liberty and independence from their pulpits, the Crown created a moniker for them: The Black Regiment (referring to the long, black robes that so many colonial clergymen wore in the pulpit). Without question, the courageous preaching and example of colonial America’s patriot-pastors provided the colonists with the inspiration and resolve to resist the tyranny of the Crown and win America’s freedom and independence.</p>
<p>I invite readers to visit my Black Regiment web page to learn more about my attempt to resurrect America’s Black-Robed Regiment. Go to:</p>
<p><a href="http://chuckbaldwinlive.com/home/black-regiment" target="_blank">Black Regiment</a></p>
<p>Readers should know, too, that a brand new book co-authored by me and my constitutional attorney son, Tim, entitled, “To Keep Or Not To Keep: Why Christians Should Not Give Up Their Guns,” will be released in just a few days. This book examines the entire Bible, both Old and New Testaments, and proves conclusively that nowhere does God expect His people to surrender their arms in the face of any would-be tyrant. With hundreds of references, we show from both Natural and Revealed Law that the right of self-defense, the right to keep and bear arms, is a God-ordained right and responsibility. This book is sure to be a blockbuster. To order the book, go to:</p>
<p><a href="http://keepyourarms.com/" target="_blank">Keep Your Arms</a></p>
<p>This is the fighting heritage of America’s pastors and preachers. So, what has happened? What has happened to that fighting spirit that once existed, almost universally, throughout America’s Christian denominations? How have preachers become so timid, so shy, and so cowardly that they will stand apathetic and mute as America faces the destruction of its liberties? Where are the preachers to explain, expound, and extrapolate the principles of liberty from Holy Writ?</p>
<p>I am absolutely convinced that one of the biggest reasons America is in the sad condition that it is in today is because the sermons Americans frequently hear from modern pulpits deal mostly with prosperity theology, entertainment evangelism, feelgoodism, emotionalism, and Aren’t-I-Wonderful ear tickling! One man recently wrote and told me that his ears had been tickled so much in church that he had calluses on them.</p>
<p>This milquetoast preaching, along with a totally false “obey-the-government-no-<wbr></wbr>matter-what” interpretation of Romans 13, have made it next to impossible to find Christian men with the courage and resolve to stand against the onslaught of socialism, corporatism, and, yes, fascism that is swallowing America whole.</p>
<p>Tim and I also wrote a book entitled, “Romans 13: The True Meaning of Submission.” This book examines Romans 13, and the rest of Scripture, and shows that nowhere does God demand that His people yield to wicked and unjust government. To order this book, to go:</p>
<p><a href="http://romans13truth.com/" target="_blank">“Romans 13: The True Meaning of Submission”</a></p>
<p>As we celebrate Patriot’s Day tomorrow, please remember Jonas Clark (along with James Caldwell, John Peter Muhlenberg, Joab Houghton, and the other brave pastors of colonial America). “He was a very great man.”</p>

<p>And while many people who never darken the doors of a church love to cast stones at preachers and churches, I have been in the Gospel ministry all of my adult life. I have pastored for over 37 years. I know the inner workings of church work; I personally know hundreds of preachers; I understand how preachers think; I have attended hundreds of church meetings and fellowships, and hundreds of pastors’ conferences and seminars. I know what it’s like to balance a church budget, counsel families in need, stand with a congregation in good times and bad. There isn’t an area of church work with which I am not very familiar. And I can also say that for over 37 years, I have never desired or attempted to harm another man’s ministry. And that is not the intention of this column.</p>
<p>However, the time has come in America to tell it like it is. These are not ordinary times. Our country is on the precipice of tyranny and oppression like we have not seen since the days of Colonial America before our War for Independence. It is no hyperbole to say that what we do–or don’t do–now will determine the state of freedom in America for the next 50 years or more. To make no decision is to decide for tyranny. We can no longer pretend that what we do doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>One of the most glaring differences between Colonial and modern America is the attitude of our pastors.</p>
<p>In 1770-1776 (and actually for many years previous to this period), Colonial pastors (of all denominations) lit the fire of freedom in the hearts of their congregants like no generation has ever seen–before or since. The British Crown was so frustrated with these patriot-pastors that they coined a moniker for them. They were called, “The Black (or Black-Robed) Regiment.” In truth, Colonial pastors were more influential in the “holy cause of liberty” (Patrick Henry) from their pulpits than any military regiment on the battlefield. And, yes, many pastors in Colonial America also fought on the battlefields in our War for Independence.</p>
<p>Today’s pastors, on the other hand, are mostly noted for saying absolutely NOTHING about the attacks that are currently being waged against our liberties. And when I say NOTHING, I mean absolutely NOTHING. About the only thing they seem to be able to do is pass out some slanted “voter guides” every Presidential election. But most don’t even do that. A few (a very few) will encourage their congregations to protest abortion; some (again, a very small number) will preach a “pro-life” sermon on “Sanctity of Life” Sunday each January. But most deliberately and stubbornly refuse to take a public position on any subject that has the air of being “political.”</p>
<p>Should we really wonder why our country is teetering on the precipice of oppression and slavery?</p>
<p>When Bible stories such as Daniel And The Lion’s Den, The Three Hebrew Children And The Burning Fiery Furnace, or the stories of Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson are told, they are taught simply as allegories or explained away as being for “another time.” The practical application of myriads of Bible examples of resistance to tyranny is NEVER TAUGHT in the vast majority of most churches today. NEVER!</p>
<p>I preached a message last Sunday to the people of Liberty Fellowship entitled, “Shepherd Or Hireling?” The text was John 10. To watch the video of this message, go to:</p>
<p><a href="http://libertyfellowshipmt.com/News/tabid/56/ID/62/Shepherd-Or-Hireling.aspx" target="_blank">“Shepherd Or Hireling?”</a></p>
<p>In this chapter, Jesus said, “But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.” (John 10:12, 13 KJV)</p>
<p>Jesus made it clear that the central difference between a true shepherd and a hireling (hired hand) was that the shepherd was willing to fight and die for the protection of the sheep, while the hired hand was not willing to risk his life for the sheep.</p>
<p>Pastors are depicted as being shepherds. Is it not then the central duty of the pastor to be willing to fight and die for the protection of his people? When he sees the wolves approaching, does he run away and leave the sheep to the slaughter or does he confront the wolves and fight to the death to protect them?</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the wolves are attacking the flock! Those mangy, mad, maniacal monsters are attacking the lives and liberties of the American people (including the Christian people in our churches) with a vengeance. When they attempt to strip us of our right to defend ourselves with arms, they are attacking the very lives and liberties of our homes and families. Life is a precious gift of Almighty God, and anyone who would make our children and families vulnerable to death and destruction by wicked and evil men is tantamount to a mad wolf that attacks the life of a little lamb.</p>
<p>How dare our shepherds (pastors) stand silent and mute in the face of such evil? How dare they refuse to sound the alarm? How dare they piously proclaim that God “has not called” them to perform this most fundamental duty of a shepherd? Does not their refusal to fight, does not their silence, does not their fear and inaction prove that they are not really shepherds at all, but merely hirelings? I believe so.</p>
<p>And knowing that what I am about to say will be misinterpreted by some, I say it still: preaching the Gospel, by itself, will NOT save America. And these preachers who hide behind the mantra that the only thing God has called them to do is preach the Gospel, and that only preaching the Gospel will save America, are either themselves seriously deluded or are despicable cowards hiding behind the veil of pretended spirituality.</p>
<p>America has had more Gospel preaching during the last 50 years than any nation in history. There are more churches, more Christian schools, more Gospel radio and television programs, more missionary endeavors, more inner-city missions and shelters, more Bible publications, and more Gospel influence in America during the last 50 years than in any country in the history of the world.</p>
<p>And what has happened to America over the last 50 years? Our historic Christian culture has been turned into rank hedonism and licentiousness; legal abortion has taken the lives of over 60 million innocent unborn babies; a blatant police-state is proliferating; more babies are being born out of wedlock than at any time in history; and now we are facing the tyrannical attempt to ban and confiscate America’s premier self-defense tool: the semi-automatic rifle. And all of this happened, and is happening, while hundreds of thousands of pastors and churches across the land “preach the Gospel.”</p>
<p>Again I say, preaching the Gospel, by itself, will not save America. Christians have to be taught how to understand; how to discern the difference between good and evil; the principles of law and justice; jurisdictional authority; and the principles of Christian resistance. As long as pastors refrain from teaching these essential and necessary truths, our nation will continue its slide into tyranny and oppression–all the Gospel preaching going forth notwithstanding.</p>
<p>I ask you: if the only thing God expected us to do was preach the Gospel, why did He give us a voluminous Bible, which is filled with examples, principles, teachings, and truths relating to virtually every important area of life? If one takes only those Scriptures that deal specifically with the Gospel, he or she is going to have a very small Bible, my friends. The stories of the Old Testament, for example, were written for “our learning.” (Romans 15:4) Hebrews 11 challenges us with the examples of Old Testament men and women who were “not afraid of the king’s commandment,” who did not fear “the wrath of the king,” who “subdued kingdoms,” “waxed valiant in fight,” and who “turned to flight the armies of the aliens.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Apostle Paul spent about as much time in jail as he did out of jail. And, of course, he was thrown in jail for breaking the unjust, evil laws of men. Every apostle except John was killed by tyrannical governments because they refused to submit to unjust laws. How First Century Christians chose to resist versus how free men and women in Colonial America chose to resist is material for another day. The point is, THEY ALL CHOSE TO RESIST.</p>
<p>The story of God’s people, from the beginning of time, is the story of people who refused to submit to tyrannical, unjust laws and chose to “obey God rather than men.” Yet, modern American pastors refuse to resist. They choose to sheepishly comply with the unjust laws of evil, wicked men. And they refuse to be the courageous shepherds for their people. It’s time to say it: any pastor who will not warn his church of the impending tyranny that is sweeping our land, any pastor who refuses to take a stand for the right of the people in his congregation to keep and bear arms–and, therefore, be able to protect the precious gift of life that has been given by God–and any pastor who stands silent while evil men trample the God-given liberties that were purchased at so awful a cost by our Christian forebears must be regarded, not as a shepherd, but as a hireling. It really doesn’t matter how nice he is, or how educated he is, or how charming he is, or how inspirational his sermons are, or how sincere he is: if he refuses to stand and fight the wolves, he is a hireling, not a shepherd.</p>
<p>By the way, to see the list of pastors around the country who have vowed to fight for the right of their flocks to keep and bear arms, go to:</p>
<p><a href="http://libertyfellowshipmt.com/Resources/SecondAmendmentPastors.aspx" target="_blank">Second Amendment Pastors</a></p>
<p>It’s time to speak plainly. The time for politeness and timidity is behind us. Any pastor who refuses to take a stand of resistance to the evil forces of tyranny that are now sweeping as a horde of locusts upon us is as guilty of the loss of our nation’s freedoms and liberties as are the evil despots who perpetrate these atrocities. He is as guilty of the death and destruction of his people as the hireling who flees in the face of the wolf is guilty of the death and destruction of the sheep.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question: would you vote for a legislator or senator who would strip you of your right to keep and bear arms? Would you passively and indifferently continue to support such a one simply because of his or her political party or nice personality or inspirational speeches? Would you not determine such a one to be a dangerous threat to your liberties, and to the safety and security of your children, and reject him or her with your vote? Sure you would. So, why would you continue to support a pastor who facilitates these ravenous beasts?</p>
<p>Christian, it’s time to vote with your feet and leave these silent, sheepish pastors and find a shepherd-pastor who will fight for the lives and liberties of your homes and children.</p>
<p>It’s time for a reality check: if your pastor is not warning the flock, alerting the flock, and fighting for the life and freedom of the flock, he is helping to put the chains of slavery and oppression upon the necks of your children and grandchildren. If he is not engaged in the fight to preserve the liberties of our nation, he is helping to put the chains of slavery and oppression upon the necks of your children and grandchildren. If your pastor refuses to publicly take a stand against the wolves of our land, he is facilitating and enabling those wolves to tear and shred the life and flesh of our country.</p>
<p>As I studied what God said about His shepherds in the Old Testament, I came upon this fascinating passage from the book of Amos: “Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch.” (Amos 3:12 KJV)</p>
<p>Do you see the picture of the shepherd God paints in this passage? The shepherd fights for his sheep so fiercely and ferociously that he fights the lion even when the sheep is half-devoured. If he is only able to save two legs or an ear, he fights like a wild man for every part of the sheep. This is how a true shepherd is supposed to fight.</p>
<p>We need pastors to stand up and fight for the lives and liberties of their flock like wild men (figuratively speaking). We need pastors to scratch and claw and bite for every last little bit of life and liberty of our country. Anything less is to wear the mark of a hireling for all eternity.</p>
<p>Christian, cast your vote! Choose a side! The line in the sand is being drawn between liberty and tyranny. Your pastor cannot be neutral, and neither can you!</p>
<p>I dare say that if every Christian across America who, in his or her heart, truly believes in liberty were to flee these say-nothing hirelings and run to shepherds who are genuinely standing for truth and liberty in our land, we could turn the ship of state around almost overnight. This is more important than the “youth program” or “children’s ministry” or “senior-saints program” or “music program,” or nice buildings or “my friends are there,” or any number of other things that so many people seem to think is so important about which church they attend.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the survival of our republic is at stake! For God’s sake, and for the sake of your children, don’t just complain, VOTE WITH YOUR FEET!</p>
<p>P.S. Remember, too, that my attorney son and I are now in the process of publishing a blockbuster new book entitled, “To Keep Or Not To Keep: Why Christians Should Not Give Up Their Guns.” This book conclusively shows that nowhere does the Bible teach that God’s people are supposed to sheepishly give up their arms in the face of tyranny. In fact, the Bible teaches just the opposite. This book is absolutely must-reading for every Christian (or non-Christian) who desires to know the truth about what the Bible teaches relative to the right of people to keep and bear arms. We are taking pre-orders now. It’s possible that the first printing of this book will be sold out even before it is printed. Orders are coming in feverishly. If you want a first edition copy of this new book, go to:</p>

<p>Few polarizing subjects are more hotly debated than gun control. Usually lost in the fray of emotional diatribes to ban guns, are the historic empirical foundations of our forefathers who fought a revolution to escape from imperial tyranny. The true reality in today’s AmeriKa is that individual liberty is the most despised activity that any citizen can exert in their lives. Both the popular state worship culture and the authoritarian hoodlums that run the government are so fearful of armed independent citizens, that they are eager to burn the Bill of Rights. Face it, the government is committed to force you to be a ward of the state and will kill you if you resist.</p>
<p>Because of government school propaganda, those indoctrinated during the last several decades are woefully lacking in the knowledge of their own heritage. Phyllis Schlafly writes in, <a href="http://www.nsm88.org/articles/arms.htm">The Founding Fathers On Right To Bear Arms</a>, and reminds of the essence in the Second Amendment.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>James Madison: Americans have &#8220;the advantage of being armed&#8221; &#8212; unlike the citizens of other countries where &#8220;the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick Henry: &#8220;The great objective is that every man be armed. . . . Everyone who is able may have a gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>George Mason: &#8220;To disarm the people [is] the best and most effectual way to enslave them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Samuel Adams: &#8220;The Constitution shall never be construed . . . to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alexander Hamilton: &#8220;The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Richard Henry Lee: &#8220;To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The chief reason America has remained a free country is the widespread private ownership of firearms. Individual ownership of guns made the American Revolution possible. <em>The principal purpose of the Second Amendment was to maintain our freedom from government.</em> It is an insult to our heritage to imply that the Founding Fathers wrote the Second Amendment just to protect deer hunters.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>End of story, but the beginning of the gulag. Before bleeding hearts start their vicious attacks on the gun toting culture, a critical examination of your own national allegiance must be questioned. Do you freely give your loyalty to the principles upon which the nation was founded or do you simply pledge your obedience to an imperium empire?</p>
<p>Consider that public officials are terrified of an armed citizenry because they are well aware that their personal safety might someday be confronted. Their outlaw edicts and coercive submission is recognized as a dictatorship. However, an armed insurrection is so remote, based upon the overwhelming lack of character and courage of most populace denizens. Facing an enemy on a battlefield would be more an exercise of genuflection and public remorse for daring to oppose the institutional establishment.</p>
<p>The current state of the art of weaponry, as any viewer of the TV military channel knows, is so advanced that open conflict against the Federal Stasi would result is suicide by cop. Homeland Security is designed to be the domestic Gestapo. Any thinking and liberty-loving person must conclude that President Barack Obama acts as if he is a potentate.</p>
<p>Rule by executive orders is a formula for tyrannical governance. Gun registration builds the database for constabulary confiscation. An organized knock at the door means that abolition of banned munitions from the &#8220;<em>Cold Dead Hands</em>&#8221; will look more like a visit from an IRS tax auditor than an assault from the nearest SWAT team.</p>
<p>Too many people accept that subjects must be intimidated into compliance of surrender. The threat of armed defiance is less likely than meek regimentation for transport to a FEMA camp. All those body bags will be used more effectively, when people’s opposition to being re-educated fails, than for dragging out your remains from your own house.</p>
<p>The practical prospects to use violence against a well funded and equipped force of government storm troopers is problematic at best. The solution to marital law thuggery is to repatriate the military legions stationed globally in the expansion of the empire. Somewhere within the ranks of the active military, the means to confront Emperor Obama exists. The <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/042212.html">military oath</a> states:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Careerist politicians, a tenured judiciary and an entrenched and escalating bureaucracy that consolidates the central government monster have systematically dismantled the Constitution. The repressive regime would have you believe that the Bradley Manning’s in the military machine are traitors just as much as Benedict Arnold. Hitherto, the certainty that going it alone resistance allows for the enormous capacities of the Intelligence Community apparatus to target any lone individual.</p>
<p>Remember the predictive example of the American crypto-anarchist, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Bell">James Dalton Bell</a>. &#8220;He created the idea of arranging for anonymously sponsored assassination payments via the Internet, which he called &#8220;assassination politics&#8221;. Since the publication of the &#8220;Assassination Politics&#8221; essay, Bell was targeted by the federal government of the United States. He was imprisoned on felony charges of tax evasion in 1997.&#8221;</p>
<p><img alt="guns.jpg" src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/GunBan.jpg.w300h164.jpg" width="240" align="Left" /><br />
Folks, let’s get real. Violent subversion just provides an excuse for even greater levels of repression. Likewise, gun confiscation has more to do with instilling universal fear in the minds of ordinary law abiding; translate &#8211; valid constitutional laws, than removing firepower out of your home.</p>
<p>Since the system dreads an armed citizenry, the criminal syndicates that divvy up their ruling fiefdoms, fear an informed population even more. Knowledge is required, but action must accompany an awakening that the totalitarian government thrives because civil society obeys the despotism of their feudal master.</p>
<p>Per the pernicious mass media, civil conduct is defined as surrendering your guns in order to repent out of a fictitious guilt or a bogus empathy for innocent victims. Insultingly, the pressitute media professes to be the purveyor of altruism. Never will you hear one utterance about the foundations of individual natural rights that underpins rightful authority for personal and community liberty.</p>
<p>The Second Amendment of the Constitution was written to protect society from the instinctual tendencies of a tyrannical government. Where is the outrage from a horror-struck public? The laundry list of dictatorial politicians from California to Illinois and in New York has identified themselves as enemies of the people.</p>
<p>The disgusting &#8220;<em>Gabby Gifford’s</em>&#8221; executive order that is being engineered by the Biden comrades will prohibit the manufacture and sale of a comprehensive range and types of weapons and accessories. Administrative fiat out of the barrel of a government regulation is more dangerous than a Glock pistol pointed at your head from a FBI agent. Many civil servants still restrain their oppressive actions to the appearance of legal conduct. However, the tyrants that make policy are bent on destroying the will of the public to oppose the transformation of America into a total police state.</p>
<p>The system will implode when enough genuine patriotic resistors organize a modern day Committee of Correspondence. The Tree of Liberty requires heroes. Unfortunately, most compliant citizens are cowards.</p>
<p>The rush to purchase guns demonstrates that a groundswell of public awareness is growing. The hoops designed to make gun ownership burdensome or personal carry permits nearly impossible to obtain, need to be endured and applied for in greater numbers.</p>
<p>By sending a loud and clear message to the establishment elitists, the righteous citizen militia will undertake the legitimate role of the Minute Men. Treason against the people has been official policy for decades. Now is the time to revolt against the TSA mindset that is calculated to condition the acquiescent and the timid from exercising their basic rights.</p>
<p>A countrywide day of protest leading up to a national strike of civil disobedience is the inherent response to government tyranny. Engage in a public dialogue at your local assembly. Organize events that demonstrate the resolve and bravery of our ancestors. Stand up to oppressive authority and defy the illicit tactics of the goon squads.</p>
<p>The system is playing a bluff. Push back now will spare bloodshed later. Never initiate any action that can be construed as violent behavior. Public political speech is the most skillful weapon to use, when exposing the oppressors.</p>
<p>The &#8220;War on Liberty&#8221; needs to be fought for the minds and hearts of all judicious thinking citizens. Guns are not the issue, recapturing your heritage and exercising your God given rights is the struggle. The state of war is on. Fight it with fervor, while maintaining your dignity. Nothing less would dishonor your defiant forebearers.</p>

</div>
<p>The greatest and most often exploited weakness of any revolution for freedom is the inability of the downtrodden populace to identify the true enemy.  History is littered with the shattered remnants of rebellions that were built upon legitimate causes but suffered because of misdirection and faulty assumptions.  For centuries, the real culprits of tyranny have found ways to redirect the ire of those they harmed in their quest for power, usually by offering a tempting scapegoat that appeals to the public’s darker impulses; their biases, their prejudices, their fears, etc.  Usually, this ends in an even more pervasive totalitarian environment as the insurgents and the scapegoats decimate each other while the elites sit back and enjoy the show.</p>
<p>Even the most successful battles against despotism, like the American Revolution, often only had a distant sense of who they were really fighting against.  This is what makes the 21st Century extraordinarily unique in the annals of civilization.  For the first time in human record, the common man has all the information necessary to examine and define the real culprits behind his subjugation.  The truth is at our fingertips, all we have to do is reach out and take it…</p>
<p>Because of the decentralized nature of information flowing through the alternative web media, our ability to generate opposition to organized elitism has never been greater.  However, this also means the stakes have never been higher.  The establishment understands well that their criminality is clearly visible, and eventually, they will be personally subject to the rage of the people.  The next fight could very well be the last for them.</p>
<p>Their playbook may be old, but the tactics they use can always be applied on a grander and more terrible scale.  Not only will they pursue whatever menacing distractions necessary to occupy the attentions of the public, they will also attempt to pose as guiding lights in the darkness they themselves created.  They will hide behind broad generalized target groups; fabricated boogie men, branded and prepackaged like franchise coffee shops on every street corner of America’s collective psyche.  Terrorists, traitors, saboteurs, whatever ethnic group happens to be convenient at the moment, whoever is easiest to present as a target for our projected malice; false enemies will be rolled out like a nightmare buffet.</p>
<p>If our nation and the rest of the world have any chance of achieving peace and liberty, it will be because those who choose to dissent against the totalitarian tide focus on the authentic virus invading and assimilating our culture.  Some call them “elitists”, “collectivists”, “centralists”, etc.  They sometimes even refer to themselves as such, but the most prominent and useful label today is that of “globalist”.   That said, we must ask what it is that defines these people?  What makes them who they are?  The following is a list of behaviors and characteristics that have been common to oligarchs through most of history.  Regardless of how a political or financial leader presents himself through rhetoric, if he displays these properties in action, he is more likely than not an opponent of individual freedom and an adversary to the principles of honor and conscience that all good men strive for.</p>
<p><strong>1)  They Seek Centralization Of Power </strong></p>
<p>Does your favorite political candidate, corporate “guru”, or media shill have a history of promoting globalization, economic harmonization, socialization, etc., sacrificing the protections of sovereignty in the name of some “greater good” that never seems to come?  Does every action they take only appear to benefit a select elite?  Do they regimentally remove options and choices from the system?  Do all of their solutions ultimately lead to the same outcome?  Do all the roads they build converge towards less liberty for the masses and more control for government?  Is their answer for every crisis to remove checks and balances and borders?  Do they constantly claim that sovereign and Constitutional protections get in the way of “progress”?  Do they use phrases like “the greater good” or “sustainable development” on a regular basis?  Add them to your list of potential mass murderers, and unfriend them on your social media accounts.  They do not have your best interests at heart…</p>
<p><strong>2)  They Enforce Policies Despite Widespread Disapproval </strong></p>
<p>In any healthy Republic, the political class is supposed to be the servant of the people.  Their employment is supposed to be predicated on their willingness to hear and understand the wishes of their constituency.  If a bill or policy arises that threatens the civil liberties or financial safety of the people, and they call for a representative to oppose it, that is exactly what he is supposed to do.  If he does otherwise, and supports a damaging or unconstitutional bill while fully aware of massive voter resistance, it means he is not in fear for his job, which means his job has not necessarily been secured by our votes, which means he is likely working for somebody else; somebody who will benefit from the bill in question.</p>
<p>Two perfect examples would be the passage of the banker bailout bills, and the indefinite detention provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act.  Both were vehemently opposed by a majority of Americans on both sides of the so called political “aisle”, and yet, they were given a majority support by our representatives in government.  This reveals an ulterior motivation within our government that is, to put it bluntly, treasonous.  If they voted for a liberty killing bill, then cross them off your roster of principled leaders and add them to your list of enemies…<br />
<strong><br />
3)  They Find Ways To Rationalize Any Behavior </strong></p>
<p>Sociopaths and psychopaths operate on their own personal form of twisted rationalism.  The magic of pure cold logic untempered by conscience or intuitive wisdom is that truth can become whatever we want it to become as long as our inner voice remains repressed.  For them, any crime can be vindicated as long as a perceived benefit can somehow be derived.  For a globalist oligarch, however, psychopathy goes far beyond mechanical moral relativism.  They are well aware that their actions are an affront to human conscience, and, they couldn’t care less.  Instead, they use rationalism as a way to manipulate the public into accepting their maniacal behavior so that they can continue without interference.</p>
<p>Globalists are so convinced of their own intellectual superiority that they feel no desire for redemption, or to compartmentalize their own evil.  They embrace that evil fully as if it were a form of strength.  One weakness of this philosophy is that it comes with a strange obsession; a desperate drive to inject moral relativism into all people around the globalist.  This exposes an inherent reliance on surrounding environment, and dependency on one’s environment to reinforce a belief system is a significant psychological weakness.</p>
<p>The great power that truth holds over the empire of lies is that the truth is not contingent on mass perception; it exists regardless of how many people believe in it.  It is autonomous.  The truth has its own soul, and arises from the ashes again and again without the benefit of mass recognition.  Lies and perverted rationalizations require an astounding amount of energy and armies of the ignorant in order to exist.  A foundation of lies is inferior, and thus, anyone who depends upon the existence of that foundation is also, by association, inferior.  Globalist are, therefore, a sub-species, an unnecessary and outdated remnant of social evolution that should be allowed to finally fade out and die away.</p>
<p><strong>4)  They Promote Economic Dependency</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who consistently tells you that you need them in order to survive has something to gain by your dependency.  A good person or government seeks to make people INDEPENDENT and self reliant, so that they can survive on their own merits and participate in the construction of their own destinies.  A manipulative person or government needs people to believe that without the services the despot provides all will come to ruin.  Totalitarian control cannot exist unless WE hand that control to them.  If the man before you claims that there is no other way to live except through him or his system, no matter how charmingly he phrases it, add him to your list as a danger to your freedom.</p>
<p><strong>5)  They Belong To A Think Tank</strong></p>
<p>I am usually apprehensive about using a broad brush to paint any single group or subset as fully criminal and beyond repair.  This kind of methodology is used daily by globalists to create rifts in societies and lure people into destroying each other.  However, I have tried to the utmost of my ability to find an influential think tank with ties to the government in our modern era that does not display the despicable behaviors listed so far, and for the life of me, I can’t find a single one.  From the the CFR, to the Rand Corporation, to the Washington Institute For Near East Policy, you will find the many of the same exact writhing globalist tapeworms and most certainly the same exact philosophies of moral relativism on display.  If they belong to a mainstream think tank, they are not a friend to liberty.<br />
<strong><br />
6)  They Cast No Reflection In The Mirror</strong></p>
<p>Or perhaps I’m thinking of a different kind of monster…</p>
<p><strong>7)  They Promote Military Force As The Primary Means To Achieve Their Ideological Objectives</strong></p>
<p>Do they confront the dynamic of every social and diplomatic problem with the use of military force and the death of those who disagree with them?  Does every conflict between them and another culture end with the destruction of thousands if not millions?  Do they flaunt a distinct kind of “my way or the highway to hell” kind of attitude?  Do they seem to crave war to the point that they are willing to manufacture excuses to fire the first missile?  If they are a warmonger, then they are your enemy, even when they happen to be trying to kill people you don’t necessarily like at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>8)  They Offer Promises They Never Intend To Keep</strong></p>
<p>If a politician promises to end an illegal war and pull American troops from the battlefield if elected to office, and then doesn’t, or, pretends to pull troops out while maintaining permanent bases and shifting private Blackwater-style contractors into the field to take their place, then he is a liar.  It’s that simple.  If a central banker promises fiat printing and massive stimulus programs will unfreeze credit markets and generate an employment recovery within a couple of years, and the fiscal situation only becomes worse afterwards, then he is a liar.  It’s that simple.</p>
<p>If a person in a position of power continuously makes promises that are impossible to fulfill, or that he obviously knows cannot be fulfilled, then he is buying time.  But buying time for what?  Well, usually, he is buying time so that he can consolidate more power, and he is hoping the public will be duped into giving that power to him in exchange for false hopes and empty dreams.  Any entity, corporate or governmental, that is unable to attain the public’s consent without conning them, is an enemy to the welfare of the public, and should be removed like a throbbing tick.</p>
<p><strong>9) You Wouldn’t Leave Your Children Alone With Them</strong></p>
<p>Ask yourself, could you leave your children in a room with this person or group and feel safe about it?  If the answer is an honest “No”, then how could you leave your country and your children’s future in their hands instead…?</p>
<p>In the coming years, the American people will face numerous threats; some real, some imagined in the sterile conference rooms of a black-hearted think tanks.  But, the most terrifying threat to our cultural roots of free thought, expression, and prosperity is wielded by a very particular and exclusive group of thin-blooded ego-maniacs.  Identifying them is not difficult.  Hiding their true nature is nearly impossible for a person or institution whose narcissism is so pronounced.  They adore their own insanity and wish to share it with the world.  If they fit the profile listed above, it is a guarantee that they will wreak havoc upon your life, directly or indirectly, someday.  Know who they are, so that when that time comes you know who to blame, and who to bring to justice.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/GeneralJohnAllen3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/GeneralJohnAllen2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>Marine General John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/us-commander-says-strain-of-ramadan-fasting-is-factor-in-afghan-troops-attacks-on-us-troops/2012/08/23/31b29268-ed2d-11e1-866f-60a00f604425_story_1.html">says one possible explanation</a> for a spike in killings of American troops by their Afghan partners is the strain of fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which ended on August 18. He said that while the reasons for the killings are not fully understood, the effect of Ramadan fasting is “likely among the causes.” There have been at least 32 attacks so far this year, killing 40 coalition members—mostly Americans—ten of them in August.</p>
<p>“The idea that they will fast during the day places great strain on them,” Allen said, adding that the stress may have been compounded by Ramadan falling during the heat of summer and the height of the fighting season. He acknowledged that hunger and heat may not be the primary causes for the killings, but it is among many “different and complex reasons for why we think this may have increased” lately.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Ramadan-Induced Sudden Jihad Syndrome. Presumably next year, the U.S. Army is going to set up counseling centers and group therapy sessions for the Afghan soldiers and policemen who cease to be responsible for their actions due to the “great strain.”</p>
<p>As for the “different and complex reasons,” in Allen’s account the words “Islam” and “jihad” did not make an appearance. In addition to the mental “strain” of fasting, he also cited Taliban infiltration of Afghan security forces and unnamed “personal Afghan grievances” against U.S. troops. Back in Washington, Colonel Lapan, spokesman for the US Joint Chiefs of Staff commented, “we don’t know what’s causing [the attacks], and we’re looking at everything.” As for the experts, Mark Jacobsen, a defense specialist at the German Marshall Fund of the U.S. and a former senior NATO civilian representative in Afghanistan, said Allen’s theory about the role of Ramadan in the attacks is “very reasonable.” John Agoglia, an executive at IDS International, which provides cultural awareness training for U.S. troops in Afghanistan, said in an interview that the insider attacks were partly linked to a Taliban effort to “psychologically dislocate” Afghans from their American trainers and advisers.</p>
<p>While the Fasting Factor is a demented fantasy, the insistence on the “infiltration” by the Taliban and its “psychological dislocation” campaign is factually incorrect. As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/world/asia/afghan-attacks-on-allied-troops-prompt-nato-to-shift-policy.html?pagewanted=all"><em>The New York Times</em> reported on August 18</a>, the military has analyzed the attacks and the results have been worrisome: “Only a handful of the 31 attacks this year have clearly been a result of Taliban activity like infiltration. That suggests a level of malaise or anger within the Afghan forces that could complicate NATO’s training program, which relies on trust and cooperation.”</p>
<p>“Could complicate” implies that this has not happened yet, which is ridiculous. In May 2011, a U.S. Army study established that killings of Americans and other NATO troops by Afghan soldiers and policemen were not “rare and isolated events.” In ten months (July 2010-May 2011) over thirty were murdered by Afghan national security forces. The problem escalated following the alleged burning of Qurans at an American military base last February, when two American officers were killed by their Afghan “colleagues” inside the Interior Ministry in Kabul. After that incident Gen. Allen <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/nato-personnel-withdrawn-from-afghan-ministries-in-wake-of-deadly-attack/2012/02/25/gIQAjalsZR_story.html">withdrew his men</a> from Afghan government facilities, while NATO personnel in the capital <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-says-fundamental-strategy-in-afghanistan-is-sound/2012/02/27/gIQApgoIeR_story.html">had to limit their contact</a> with Afghan government institutions to cell phones and e-mail. Another crisis started on March 11, when an American sergeant killed 16 unarmed Afghan civilians in a village near Kandahar. The “insider killings” reached a new high after that incident, steadily escalating to two deaths a week in August.</p>
<p>The primary reason for the killings is the religiously inspired animosity most Afghans feel for the infidel in general, and Americans in particular. It is driven by the eminently orthodox dogma of <em>jihad</em>—supported by countless examples through history—that if a Muslim land is occupied by infidels, it is obligatory for the Muslims to resist the <em>kufr</em>—soldiers and civilians alike—and kill them, while pretending to be their friends if this facilitates the desired outcome.</p>
<p><em>A war waged by non-Muslims in a predominantly Muslim land is inevitably a religious war.</em>  This explanation—which is at least worthy of serious consideration by the military authorities, for the sake of the dead and others who are in harm’s way—is not allowed into the discourse of top field commanders, their professional advisors and political masters. They act like oncologists who willfully won’t, or else are not allowed to, diagnose metastatic cancer. Their political masters prefer to stick to their politically correct dogmas than to accept an explanation that is at odds with their world view. As a result, American and allied soldiers die.</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, the hatred of the infidel occupier is combined with studied contempt of Afghans of all political hues for the rhetoric of “partnership,” with which the American political and military establishment remains infatuated. No partnership is possible. History tells us that Muslim soldiers can respect and obey non-Muslim masters, but not in this case. They will do so only when the “infidel” officer commands Muslims from a clear-cut position of indisputable authority.</p>
<p>During World War II, close to 400,000 Punjabi Muslims volunteered for the British Indian Army. From 1936 until the partition in 1947, <a href="http://defencejournal.com/sept99/martial-races.htm">Muslims from different parts of the Subcontinent accounted</a> for about a third of the Indian Army personnel. Coming mainly from the traditionally martial communities in today’s Pakistan, they were hugely over-represented in the all-volunteer force. They were commanded mostly by British officers, invariably so above the rank of major. Before 1939, they were on station duty in Egypt, Palestine, Iraq, Aden, the Gulf, Burma, Malaya and Hong Kong—some of the hottest places on Earth. During the war they fought mostly in East Africa, North Africa, Syria, Tunisia, Malaya, Burma, and Italy—except for the last, lands and regions no less hot and often even less hospitable than Afghanistan itself. There is no record, however, of “insider attacks” presenting a problem—Ramadan or no Ramadan.</p>
<p>In the Russian Empire, following the conquest of the Caucasus and Central Asia, Muslim territorial regiments—commanded by Russian officers—were established in those territories that were granted autonomous status, such as the Emirate of Bukhara or the Khanate of Khiva. Elsewhere, regiments of Muslims were incorporated into the regular army—e.g. the Muslim cavalry of Dagestan, the Crimean Tatar squadron—but they were also officered by Russians. They were reliable, loyal, fought well, and endured the Ramadan, it seems, with no great stress—or at least we have no such record.</p>
<p>In our own time, Muslims are significantly over-represented in the French Army—accounting for <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20100831-focus-djibouti-ramadan-french-army-fasting-tradition-muslim-chaplain">a fifth</a> of the rank-and-file—but most of their officers are French. While the loyalty of these soldiers <a href="http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/1616">is considered uncertain if they were asked to restore</a> law and order in the restive Muslim banlieus, insider attacks are not a problem and an assiduous Internet search has failed to find any link between their disciplinary or behavioral problems and Ramadan fasting.</p>
<p>Last but not least, their German officers were full of praise for some hundreds of thousands of Muslims who served as volunteers, mostly in the Waffen SS, between 1941 and 1945. They came from the Crimea, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Chechnya, Dagestan, Kosovo, Central Asia—an ethnically and racially diverse group—and yet there is no record of insider killings or the Ramadan Syndrome.</p>
<p>Poor General Allen. He is facing a new, altogether unprecedented phenomenon. And poor Afghan soldiers. They are under such strain…</p>

</div>
<p>Totalitarian governments, like persistent forms of cancer, have latched onto the long history of man, falling and then reemerging from the deep recesses of our cultural biology to wreak havoc upon one unlucky generation to the next.  The assumption by most is that these unfortunate empires are the product of bureaucracies gone awry; overtaken by the chaotic maddening hunger for wealth and power, and usually manipulated by the singular ambitions of a mesmerizing dictator.  For those of us in the Liberty Movement who are actually educated on the less acknowledged details of history, oligarchy and globalized centralism is much less random than this, and a far more deliberate and devious process than the general unaware public is willing to consider.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the final truth is very complex, even for us…</p>
<p>One cannot place the blame of despotism entirely on the shoulders of globalists.  Sadly, the crimes of elites are only possible with a certain amount of complicity from subsections of the populace.  Without our penchant for apathy and fear, there can be no control.  That is to say, there is no power over us but that which we give away.  We pave the road to our own catastrophes.</p>
<p>In the end, a tyrant’s primary job is not to crush the masses and rule out of malevolence, but to obtain the voluntary consent of the citizenry, usually through trickery and deceit.  Without the permission of the people, subconscious or otherwise, no tyranny can survive.</p>
<p>As with the oppressive regimes of the past, America has undergone a dramatic transformation, heavy with fear and ignorance.  Our tradition of elections has been corrupted and negated by the false left/right paradigm, and the leaderships of both defunct parties now seek only to elevate a select minority of men bent on globalization.  Our Constitutional liberties have been dismantled by legal chicanery.  Our principles have been diluted by intellectual games of rationalism and moral relativism.  Our country is ripe for conquest.</p>
<p>Americans battle over whose side is most to blame; Democrat or Republican, while ironically being disenchanted with both entities.  For some people, the thought of holding each party equally accountable, or accepting that they are essentially the same animal, never crosses their minds.</p>
<p>While this irrelevant farce of a debate rages on, the true culprits plotting the demise of our Republic gain momentum, and implement policy initiatives that the public should and must take note of.  In the past year alone, many blatant steps towards the Orwellian gulag have been openly administered.  A carnival of peddlers and freaks and greasy popcorn overwhelms our senses, but the stench of this cheap circus still tickles our noses, and if we use our eyes for even a moment, certain dangerous trends reveal themselves.  Here are just a few recent events that bear a dire warning; the ultimate assault on freedom in this nation grows near…<br />
<strong><br />
Acclimation To Subservience </strong></p>
<p>Every totalitarian state worth its salt has its own goon squad.  The Nazi’s had the “Brownshirts”, the Soviets had the “Militsiya” and the “Voluntary People’s Brigade”, the Communist Chinese have the “Chengguan”, etc.  In America, however, all tyrannical measures are given innocuous bureaucratic labels to mislead and distract the masses.  In this country, we have the Transportation Security Administration…</p>
<p>The TSA has become the most hated alphabet agency in the U.S. in perhaps the fastest time on record.  It has violated the personal rights of more people on a daily basis in my view than the IRS, DEA, and the ATF combined.  Clearly, this slobbering demon child of the Department of Homeland Security is being molded for something quite terrible and grand.</p>
<p>When confronted by the public on the use of irradiating and intrusive naked body scanner technology, the agency responded by allowing their blue handed ghoul army to molest our nether-regions.  When confronted by state and local governments on their absurd tactics, the TSA threatened economic blockades and airport shutdowns.  The organization then began expanding its jurisdiction to bus and train stations and even our highways when it introduced the VIPR program and implemented random roadside checkpoints in Tennessee last year.  But, this behavior is nothing compared to what is next on the horizon: a compromise…</p>
<p>Beware of government agencies bearing gifts.  The TSA along with the International Air Transport Association has announced a new methodology of “less intrusive” passenger screening measures, in order to address the concerns of the public over pat downs and irradiating naked body scanners.  This SOUNDS like a step in the right direction, and a proper response to the grievances of the citizenry.  Instead, it turns out to be a refined example of totalitarianism in motion, and a perfect lesson in how the masses can be duped into handing over their inherent freedoms.</p>
<p>Revamped security protocols call for biometric data collection, including fingerprint and retina scans, and a tunnel which combines multiple detection systems into one area (who knows how radioactive this will end up being):</p>
<p><a href="http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/story/2012-06-19/Faster-better-airport-security-checkpoints-not-that-far-off/55693916/1">http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/story/2012-06-19/Faster-better-airport-security-checkpoints-not-that-far-off/55693916/1 </a></p>
<p>The mainstream article above makes this development sound like a win/win scenario for everyone, painting biometric data collection as a matter of convenience, but it also reveals the true design of the system; to illicit voluntary subservience:</p>
<p><em>“The key to speeding up checkpoints and making security less intrusive will be to identify and assess travelers according to the risks they pose to safety in the skies. The so-called riskiest or unknown passengers would face the toughest scrutiny, including questioning and more sensitive electronic screening. Those who voluntarily provide more information about themselves to the government would be rewarded with faster passage…”</em></p>
<p>They enforce destructive anti-personal rights policies then pretend to acquiesce by replacing them with a technocratic nightmare grid which requires the cataloging of our very genetic essence in order to function.  The only remaining injustice left would be to apply this grid to the rest of the country outside of the airports and train stations, which I assure you, they plan to do.<br />
<strong><br />
Militarization</strong></p>
<p>Last week, I covered the disturbing use of armored vehicles (APC’s or urban tanks) in open training regiments on the streets of St. Louis by the U.S Army, despite the fact that all of their exercises could have easily been accomplished on any number of military bases across the country.  The action is an obvious attempt to condition the American populace to the sight of military units operating in a policing capacity:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/866-military-tanks-on-st-louis-streetsbut-why">http://www.alt-market.com/articles/866-military-tanks-on-st-louis-streetsbut-why</a></p>
<p>I received multiple letters from current serving military who stated that in all their years in the armed forces they had never seen such a brash mishandling of public relations or an overstepping of bounds when it came to the restrictions of Posse Comitatus.  It was encouraging to hear from military men and women who did not agree with or condone this kind of psyop activity on the part of our government.</p>
<p>Though the St. Louis event is not isolated, I believe it does represent an escalation.</p>
<p>Remember the controversy over the Mayor of Toledo and his refusal to allow 200 Marines to conduct urban combat drills on the public streets of his city in 2008?  The media clamored to crucify this public official; one of the few who had any sense whatsoever in his head:</p>
<p><a href="http://voices.yahoo.com/toledo-mayor-faces-backlash-ousting-marines-896105.html">http://voices.yahoo.com/toledo-mayor-faces-backlash-ousting-marines-896105.html</a></p>
<p>Or the tactical exercises using helicopters and combat troops over LA and Chicago early this year?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lapdonline.org/newsroom/news_view/50045">http://www.lapdonline.org/newsroom/news_view/50045</a></p>
<p><a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/04/17/city-black-hawk-helicopter-flights-were-just-a-training-exercise/">http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/04/17/city-black-hawk-helicopter-flights-were-just-a-training-exercise/</a></p>
<p>During each one of these events, city officials and local media attempted to inoculate the public with claims that they were “simply exercises”.  This argument misses the point entirely.  Whether or not these are “exercises” is not the issue.  The issue is that this training could be done ON BASE.  Using public streets and running drills within cities is absolutely unnecessary given the vast resources already available to the military, unless, of course, the goal is to BE SEEN by the public and to influence them to view the sight of armed troops around them as “normal”.</p>
<p>Add to this the fact that many of these military training exercises are being conducted in tandem with local police departments, and you have a recipe for the utter militarization of our society, turning peace officers into combat soldiers, and combat soldiers into law enforcement mechanisms; a juxtaposition that will soon lead to unmitigated disaster.</p>
<p><strong>Arms Race Against the People?</strong></p>
<p>When a country is quietly preparing for war, the first signs are usually revealed by a disclosure of armaments.  If stockpiling is taking place without a warranted threat present from a legitimate enemy, there is a considerable likelihood of aggression on the part of that nation.  America has gone well beyond the psychological process of militarization and has begun the extensive arming of particular agencies whose primary purpose revolves around the domestic.</p>
<p>The DHS, for instance, placed an order for over 450 million rounds of hollowpoint .40 cal ammunition in April of this year:</p>
<p><a href="http://rt.com/usa/news/dhs-million-point-government-179/">http://rt.com/usa/news/dhs-million-point-government-179/</a></p>
<p>And it placed an order for over 7000 new semi-automatic combat rifles chambered in .223 (5.56 by 45mm NATO) immediately after:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=d791b6aa0fd9d3d8833b2efa08300033&amp;tab=core&amp;tabmode=list&amp;=">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=d791b6aa0fd9d3d8833b2efa08300033&amp;tab=core&amp;tabmode=list&amp;=</a></p>
<p>While local police through federal programs (like the 1033 Program) are being given millions of dollars in free military equipment, including body armor, night vision equipment, APC&#8217;s, aircraft, first aid supplies, weapons, surveillance equipment, Kevlar helmets, gas masks and filters, vehicles, etc.:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ogs.state.sc.us/surplus/SP-1033-index.phtm">http://www.ogs.state.sc.us/surplus/SP-1033-index.phtm</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/06/cops-military-gear/all/">http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/06/cops-military-gear/all/</a></p>
<p>All of this equipment, though issued to state agencies, is still heavily tracked and regulated by the federal government, making it clear that these “gifts” come with strings attached:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newsherald.com/articles/program-103291-state-law.html">http://www.newsherald.com/articles/program-103291-state-law.html </a></p>
<p>And finally, new FAA regulations will soon allow the dispersion of tens of thousands of predator drones with armament capability in the skies of the U.S. over the course of the next few years:<br />
<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/feb/7/coming-to-a-sky-near-you/"></p>
<p>http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/feb/7/coming-to-a-sky-near-you/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/10/nation/la-na-drone-arrest-20111211">http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/10/nation/la-na-drone-arrest-20111211</a></p>
<p>Now, anyone with any logic would ask who it is that the government is arming itself and local police to fight against?  Al Qaeda?  Let’s not be naïve…</p>
<p>The passage of the NDAA and its provisions for the indefinite detainment of ANY person, even an American citizen, under the laws of war has ended the debate over government intent in terms of domestic action.  FBI Director Robert Mueller’s admission that he “did not know” if assassination programs would be used against American citizens also heaped evidence on the matter.  The bottom line?  Our government wishes to label and treat citizens as enemy combatants.  Of course they would then organize armaments to follow through on their policy.<br />
<strong><br />
Pulling The Trigger </strong></p>
<p>All despotic systems have another distinct similarity; they each began with a series of trigger events which opened the door to tighter controls over the population.  The most immediate trigger event for the U.S. is the looming peril of a collapsing economy followed by inevitable civil unrest.  With the EU currently in debt shambles, global markets are on the verge of a considerable breakdown.  The Federal Reserve response will be predictable; QE3 and massive stimulus all around to mitigate the crisis.  This time, though, the go-to Keynesian quick fix will not work in the slightest.  In fact, it will make matters more untenable by placing the world reserve status of the dollar at risk.</p>
<p>Everything that has happened so far in the markets this year has been easy to foresee.  Alt-Market predicted the economic slowdown around the world and the collapse of overall demand using the Baltic Dry Index as a gauge back in January:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/540-baltic-dry-index-signals-renewed-market-collapse">http://www.alt-market.com/articles/540-baltic-dry-index-signals-renewed-market-collapse</a></p>
<p>We also predicted the accelerated turmoil in the EU in light of the recent election results in France and Greece:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/765-economic-alert-if-youre-not-worried-yetyou-should-be">http://www.alt-market.com/articles/765-economic-alert-if-youre-not-worried-yetyou-should-be</a></p>
<p>If alternative economic analysts can predict these developments despite the manipulated statistics spewed out by the government every month, then I think the government and our central bank has a tremendously transparent view of what is coming down the road in terms of financial distress.  I believe the establishment is very well aware of a potential crisis event, economic or otherwise, that is barreling down upon the U.S.  I believe the evidence shows that they are preparing for this eventuality in a command and control fashion, without alerting the public to the coming implosion.  I believe they will use the despair that flows forth from the fiscal wreckage as an excuse to institute martial law.</p>
<p>Call it &#8220;crazy&#8221;.  Call it “conspiracy theory”.  Call it “coincidence”.  Call it &#8220;fear mongering&#8221;.  Whatever you like.  I find it far more insane to shrug off the strange and twisted behavior of our power structure, and simply hope that it’s all irrelevant to the future.  Whenever I run into starry eyed historical romanticists who look back in astonishment at the tyrannies of the past and wonder out loud, “How could those people have not known where their country was headed?!!”, I think of where we are today.</p>

			<p>This is a story about Patriots&#8217; Day, April 19, and Patriot Day, September 11, and is about better days in the United States, when a man could be known and elected President even with truly &#8220;gallant, generous, manly, and disinterested actions&#8221; lurking in his past.  It is also a story about Paul Revere.</p>
<p>Listen  my children and you shall hear<br />
Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere<br />
On the Eighteenth of April in Seventy-five.<br />
Hardly a man is now alive<br />
Who remembers that famous day and year.&#8221;1</p>
<p>And so it was that Paul Revere, his father nez Apollos Rivoire,2  galloped from town to town in the wee hours of the morning of April 19, 1775, warning the townspeople in Eastern Massachusetts that British Regulars were planning to stage surprise raid on the towns for guns and gunpowder.  Instead, the Redcoats were surprised by local militia defending their homeland security.  That morning took place the battles of Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts, first battles of the American Revolution, and the date became a much-honored state holiday in Massachusetts, Patriots&#8217; Day, not to be confused with Patriot Day, September 11, officially marking the first day of the first decade of the War Against Terror.</p>
<p>Paul Revere was a man of many talents.  On the date of his ride he was described in a British &#8220;who&#8217;who&#8221; of American rebels as a &#8220;silver smith.&#8221;3   His silver &#8220;is regarded as one of the outstanding achievements in American decorative arts.&#8221; 4   His copper cooking ware has been known for centuries as &#8220;Revere Ware&#8221; although with the loss of 500 American jobs in the nineties,it is now manufactured in India.  He was a dentist, although the story that he made George Washington&#8217;s falsies, is disputed.  He was one of the instigators of the Boston Tea Party, although he also served to protect the ship against vandals after that event.  And he was a skilled engraver of copper plates.  He is said to have been present at the Boston Massacre, and his engraving of the events there brought folks to a fever pitch, about ready to organize a lynch mob against the British Regulars who shot five Boston citizens at the Massacre.</p>
<p>The British had quartered regiments equal to approximately one fourth of the population in<br />
Boston to enforce the taxes that were to be the subject of the Tea Party, and relations were, to say the least, strained.  British soldiers were regularly pelted with stones and snowballs.  As depicted in Revere&#8217;s engraving, the Massacre took place, appropriately enough, in front of the Old State House,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/massacrereverelarge3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/massacrereverelarge2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a> which has been the site of as many significant events in American history over the last two and a half centuries as the Capitol itself.  Take a good look, for instance, at the balcony, which you can see above the gun smoke in Revere&#8217;s engraving.  That&#8217;s one of two spots where the Declaration of Independence was read to the assembled masses on July 4, 1776, and again by British Queen Elizabeth on July 4, 1976.</p>
<p>But Paul Revere&#8217;s depiction of a defenseless and unarmed gathering being shot at by a line of red-coated marksmen, is said to have been better politics than reporting.  What apparently occurred was that a British soldier was doing sentry duty when a boy taunted him with something like, &#8220;Why won&#8217;t you pay the bill for your wig?&#8221; whereupon the soldier belted the boy, whereupon the boy recruited help and so did the soldier, whereupon a crowd gathered who began pelting the soldiers with stones and snowballs and someone, either a soldier or someone from the crowd, yelled &#8220;Shoot them,&#8221; whereupon the soldiers began shooting, leaving five dead. One man taunts another over a wig, and five men end up dead. &#8220;When will we ever learn, when will we ever learn?&#8221;5  One of the five,  a leader of the crowd, Crispus Attucks, an African-American who has subsequently been considered one of the heroes of colonial American history, was depicted by Revere as white.</p>
<p>Revere&#8217;s engraving circulated in Boston and its surroundings, and the public became incensed at the British soldiers who had shot five citizens dead.</p>
<p>Fearful for their careers and even their lives, all the lawyers approached to defend the soldiers refused.  John Adams was, like Barack Obama a Harvard-educated lawyer who would later be President, but there, apparently, the similarities end,  Adams stepped forth, declared that the Redcoats had the right to a fair trial and that he would defend them.  He did so, and well.  Most of the British soldiers were acquitted, based essentially on self-defense.  For many months Adams was treated as a traitor.  His legal business dropped by half. A few months after the trial, there is the notation in his journal, &#8220;Never in more misery my whole life.&#8221;   But in his old age, the retired President was able to look back at his defense of the British soldiers in 1770 as &#8220;one of the most gallant, generous, manly, and disinterested actions of my whole life, and one of the best pieces of service I ever rendered my country.&#8221;7  ]  And so it was.</p>
<p>If the Revolution had its Boston Massacre, then the War on Terror had its 9/11.  But Patriots&#8217; Day is not to be confused with Patriot Day.  Barrack Obama did not perceive things as had John Adams.  When the alleged perpetrators of the killings in Boston were arrested, they received a fair trial and were even acquitted.  When the alleged mastermind of 9/11was caught, he was summarily shot dead, apparently on orders of President Obama.  No arrest, no trial, no opportunity to give his side of what actually occurred.. And now the<br />
President&#8217;s &#8220;right&#8221; to have the country&#8217;s perceived enemies shot on sight, even on American soil &#8211; no arrest, no trial &#8211; has been established by law.John Adams, where are you when we need you?</p>
<p>1 The full text of the poem, required of many a<br />
school child in Massachusetts to be put to memory, is: </p>
<p><strong>Paul Revere&#8217;s Ride Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</strong></p>
<p>Listen my children and you shall hear<br />
Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,<br />
On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;<br />
Hardly a man is now alive<br />
Who remembers that famous day and year.<br />
He said to his friend, &#8220;If the British march<br />
By land or sea from the town to-night,<br />
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch<br />
Of the North Church tower as a signal light,&#8211;<br />
One if by land, and two if by sea;<br />
And I on the opposite shore will be,<br />
Ready to ride and spread the alarm<br />
Through every Middlesex village and farm,<br />
For the country folk to be up and to arm.&#8221;<br />
Then he said &#8220;Good-night!&#8221; and with muffled oar<br />
Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,<br />
Just as the moon rose over the bay,<br />
Where swinging wide at her moorings lay<br />
The Somerset, British man-of-war;<br />
A phantom ship, with each mast and spar<br />
Across the moon like a prison bar,<br />
And a huge black hulk, that was magnified<br />
By its own reflection in the tide.<br />
Meanwhile, his friend through alley and street<br />
Wanders and watches, with eager ears,<br />
Till in the silence around him he hears<br />
The muster of men at the barrack door,<br />
The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,<br />
And the measured tread of the grenadiers,<br />
Marching down to their boats on the shore.<br />
Then he climbed the tower of the Old North Church,<br />
By the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,<br />
To the belfry chamber overhead,<br />
And startled the pigeons from their perch<br />
On the sombre rafters, that round him made<br />
Masses and moving shapes of shade,&#8211;<br />
By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,<br />
To the highest window in the wall,<br />
Where he paused to listen and look down<br />
A moment on the roofs of the town<br />
And the moonlight flowing over all.<br />
Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,<br />
In their night encampment on the hill,<br />
Wrapped in silence so deep and still<br />
That he could hear, like a sentinel&#8217;s tread,<br />
The watchful night-wind, as it went<br />
Creeping along from tent to tent,<br />
And seeming to whisper, &#8220;All is well!&#8221;<br />
A moment only he feels the spell<br />
Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread<br />
Of the lonely belfry and the dead;<br />
For suddenly all his thoughts are bent<br />
On a shadowy something far away,<br />
Where the river widens to meet the bay,&#8211;<br />
A line of black that bends and floats<br />
On the rising tide like a bridge of boats.<br />
Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,<br />
Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride<br />
On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.<br />
Now he patted his horse&#8217;s side,<br />
Now he gazed at the landscape far and near,<br />
Then, impetuous, stamped the earth,<br />
And turned and tightened his saddle girth;<br />
But mostly he watched with eager search<br />
The belfry tower of the Old North Church,<br />
As it rose above the graves on the hill,<br />
Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.<br />
And lo! as he looks, on the belfry&#8217;s height<br />
A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!<br />
He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,<br />
But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight<br />
A second lamp in the belfry burns.<br />
A hurry of hoofs in a village street,<br />
A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,<br />
And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark<br />
Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet;<br />
That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,<br />
The fate of a nation was riding that night;<br />
And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,<br />
Kindled the land into flame with its heat.<br />
He has left the village and mounted the steep,<br />
And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,<br />
Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;<br />
And under the alders that skirt its edge,<br />
Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,<br />
Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.<br />
It was twelve by the village clock<br />
When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.<br />
He heard the crowing of the cock,<br />
And the barking of the farmer&#8217;s dog,<br />
And felt the damp of the river fog,<br />
That rises after the sun goes down.<br />
It was one by the village clock,<br />
When he galloped into Lexington.<br />
He saw the gilded weathercock<br />
Swim in the moonlight as he passed,<br />
And the meeting-house windows, black and bare,<br />
Gaze at him with a spectral glare,<br />
As if they already stood aghast<br />
At the bloody work they would look upon.<br />
It was two by the village clock,<br />
When he came to the bridge in Concord town.<br />
He heard the bleating of the flock,<br />
And the twitter of birds among the trees,<br />
And felt the breath of the morning breeze<br />
Blowing over the meadow brown.<br />
And one was safe and asleep in his bed<br />
Who at the bridge would be first to fall,<br />
Who that day would be lying dead,<br />
Pierced by a British musket ball.<br />
You know the rest. In the books you have read<br />
How the British Regulars fired and fled,&#8212;<br />
How the farmers gave them ball for ball,<br />
&gt;From behind each fence and farmyard wall,<br />
Chasing the redcoats down the lane,<br />
Then crossing the fields to emerge again<br />
Under the trees at the turn of the road,<br />
And only pausing to fire and load.<br />
So through the night rode Paul Revere;<br />
And so through the night went his cry of alarm<br />
To every Middlesex village and farm,&#8212;<br />
A cry of defiance, and not of fear,<br />
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,<br />
And a word that shall echo for evermore!<br />
For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,<br />
Through all our history, to the last,<br />
In the hour of darkness and peril and need,<br />
The people will waken and listen to hear<br />
The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,<br />
And the midnight message of Paul Revere.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/MinuteMan3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/MinuteMan2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>April 19, 1775, should be regarded as important a date to Americans as July 4, 1776. It’s a shame that we don’t celebrate it as enthusiastically as we do Independence Day. It’s even more shameful that many Americans don’t even remember what happened on this day back in 1775. For the record, historians call this day, “Patriot’s Day.” More specifically, it was the day that the shot was fired that was heard ’round the world. It was the day America’s War for Independence began.</p>
<p>Being warned of approaching British troops by Dr. Joseph Warren, Pastor Jonas Clark and his male congregants of the Church of Lexington (numbering 60-70) were the ones that stood with their muskets in front of the Crown’s troops (numbering over 800), who were on orders to seize a cache of arms which were stored at Concord and to arrest Sam Adams and John Hancock (who were known to be in the area, and who had actually taken refuge in Pastor Clark’s home).</p>
<p>According to eyewitnesses, the king’s troops opened fire on the militiamen almost without warning, immediately killing eight of Pastor Clark’s parishioners. In self defense, the Minutemen returned fire. These were the first shots of the Revolutionary War. This took place on Lexington Green, which was located directly beside the church-house where those men worshipped each Sunday. Adams and Hancock were not taken. They owed their lives to Pastor Clark and his brave Minutemen–albeit eight of those men gave their lives protecting Adams and Hancock.</p>
<p>According to Pastor Clark, these are the names of the eight men who died on Lexington Green: Robert Munroe, Jonas Parker, Samuel Hadley, Jonathan Harrington, Jr., Isaac Muzzy, Caleb Harrington, and John Brown, all of Lexington, and one Mr. Porter of Woburn.</p>
<p>By the time the British troops arrived at the Concord Bridge, hundreds of colonists had amassed a defense of the bridge. A horrific battle took place, and the British troops were routed and soon retreated back to Boston. America’s War for Independence had begun!</p>
<p>Yes, ladies and gentlemen, these two elements of American history are lost to the vast majority of historians today: 1) it was attempted gun confiscation by the British troops that ignited America’s War for Independence, and 2) it was a pastor and his flock that mostly comprised the “Minutemen” who fired the shots that started our great Revolution.</p>
<p>With that thought in mind, I want to devote today’s column to honoring the brave preachers of Colonial America–these “children of the Pilgrims,” as one Colonial pastor’s descendent put it.</p>
<p>It really wasn’t that long ago. However, with the way America’s clergymen act today, one would think that preachers such as James Caldwell, John Peter Muhlenberg, Joab Houghton, and Jonas Clark never existed. But they did exist; and without them, this country we call the United States of America that would not exist.</p>
<p>Caldwell was a Presbyterian; Muhlenberg was a Lutheran; Houghton was a Baptist; and no one really seems to know what denomination (if any) Jonas Clark claimed, although one historian referred to Clark as a Trinitarian and a Calvinist. But these men had one thing in common (besides their faith in Jesus Christ): they were all ardent patriots who participated in America’s War for Independence, and in the case of Jonas Clark, actually ignited it.</p>
<p>James Caldwell</p>
<p>James Caldwell was called “The Rebel High Priest” or “The Fighting Chaplain.” Caldwell is most famous for the “Give ’em Watts!” story.</p>
<p>During the Springfield (New Jersey) engagement, the colonial militia ran out of wadding for their muskets. Quickly, Caldwell galloped to the Presbyterian church, and returning with an armload of hymnals, threw them to the ground, and hollered, “Now, boys, give ’em Watts!” He was referring to the famous hymn writer, Isaac Watts, of course.</p>
<p>The British hated Caldwell so much, they murdered his wife, Hannah, in her own home, as she sat with her children on her bed. Later, a fellow American was bribed by the British to assassinate Pastor Caldwell–which is exactly what he did. Americans loyal to the Crown burned both his house and church. No less than three cities and two public schools in the State of New Jersey bear his name.</p>
<p>John Peter Muhlenberg</p>
<p>John Peter Muhlenberg was pastor of a Lutheran church in Woodstock, Virginia, when hostilities erupted between Great Britain and the American colonies. When news of Bunker Hill reached Virginia, Muhlenberg preached a sermon from Ecclesiastes 3 to his congregation He reminded his parishioners that there was a time to preach and a time to fight. He said that, for him, the time to preach was past and it was time to fight. He then threw off his vestments and stood before his congregants in the uniform of a Virginia colonel.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg later was promoted to brigadier-general in the Continental Army, and later, major general. He participated in the battles of Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and Yorktown. He went on to serve in both the US House of Representatives and US Senate.</p>
<p>Joab Houghton</p>
<p>Joab Houghton was in the Hopewell (New Jersey) Baptist Meeting House at worship when he received the first information regarding the battles at Lexington and Concord. His great-grandson gives the following eloquent description of the way he treated the tidings:</p>
<p>“[M]ounting the great stone block in front of the meeting-house, he beckoned the people to stop. Men and women paused to hear, curious to know what so unusual a sequel to the service of the day could mean. At the first, words a silence, stern as death, fell over all. The Sabbath quiet of the hour and of the place was deepened into a terrible solemnity. He told them all the story of the cowardly murder at Lexington by the royal troops; the heroic vengeance following hard upon it; the retreat of Percy; the gathering of the children of the Pilgrims round the beleaguered hills of Boston; then pausing, and looking over the silent throng, he said slowly, ‘Men of New Jersey, the red coats are murdering our brethren of New England! Who follows me to Boston?’ And every man in that audience stepped out of line, and answered, ‘I!’ There was not a coward or a traitor in old Hopewell Baptist Meeting-House that day.” (Cathcart, William. Baptists and the American Revolution. Philadelphia: S.A. George, 1876, rev. 1976. Print.)</p>
<p>Jonas Clark</p>
<p>As I said at the beginning of this column, Jonas Clark was pastor of the Church of Lexington, Massachusetts, on April 19, 1775, the day that British troops marched on Concord with orders to arrest Sam Adams and John Hancock, and to seize a cache of firearms. It was Pastor Clark’s male congregants who were the first ones to face-off against the British troops as they marched through Lexington. When you hear the story of the Minutemen at the Battle of Lexington, remember those Minutemen were Pastor Jonas Clark and the men of his congregation.</p>
<p>On the One Year Anniversary of the Battle of Lexington, Clark preached a sermon based upon his eyewitness testimony of the event. He called his sermon, “The Fate of Blood-Thirsty Oppressors and God’s Tender Care of His Distressed People.” His sermon has been republished by Nordskog Publishing under the title, “The Battle of Lexington, A Sermon and Eyewitness Narrative, Jonas Clark, Pastor, Church of Lexington.”</p>
<p>Order the book containing Clark’s sermon at:</p>
<p><a href="http://chuckbaldwinlive.com/home/archives/www.NordskogPublishing.com">www.NordskogPublishing.com</a></p>
<p>Of course, these four brave preachers were not the only ones to participate in America’s fight for independence. There were Episcopalian ministers such as Dr. Samuel Provost of New York, Dr. John Croes of New Jersey, and Robert Smith of South Carolina. Presbyterian ministers such as Adam Boyd of North Carolina and James Armstrong of Maryland, along with many others, also took part.</p>
<p>So many Baptist preachers participated in America’s War for Independence that, at the conclusion of the war, President George Washington wrote a personal letter to the Baptist people saying, “I recollect with satisfaction that the religious societies of which you are a member have been, throughout America, uniformly and almost unanimously, the firm friends to civil liberty, and the preserving promoters of our glorious Revolution.” It also explains how Thomas Jefferson could write to a Baptist congregation and say, “We have acted together from the origin to the end of a memorable Revolution.” (McDaniel, George White. The People Called Baptists. The Sunday School Board of the Southern Baptist Convention, 1918. Print.)</p>
<p>And although not every pastor was able to actively participate in our fight for independence, so many pastors throughout colonial America preached the principles of liberty and independence from their pulpits that the Crown created a moniker for them: The Black Regiment (referring to the long, black robes that so many colonial clergymen wore in the pulpit). Without question, the courageous preaching and example of colonial America’s patriot-pastors provided the colonists with the inspiration and resolve to resist the tyranny of the Crown and win America’s freedom and independence.</p>

<p>The financial press is inundated with the most ominous reports of an EU meltdown. The downturn in economic activity and little growth all comes down to the unsustainability in servicing the debt obligations. Sovereign countries bailouts only pile on even more debt. European banks are tied to a Euro dominated currency, while the political union is anything but unified. Any serious student of European history inescapably concludes that the perennial ambition to orchestrate a single patchwork of diverse cultures and interests into a pan European brotherhood is always doomed. A consensus fraternity based upon socialistic economics feeds the inevitable default. However, never fear the banksters will not suffer, as the globalists prepare to use their next crisis, to consolidate their grip of world dominance.</p>
<p>Greece is the Sarajevo in the start of the next currency world war. A containable matter ready to snowball into a full-scale mobilization of competing factions, poses the unwinding of world markets. Never underestimate the inventiveness of financial ministers to paper over an impending default with more debt. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-14/greek-government-comment-after-papandreou-merkel-sarkozy-call.html">Bloomberg</a> reports, &#8220;The following is an English translation of a statement made by Government spokesman and Minister of State Elias Mosialos after a conference call between Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy today, received by e-mail from Mosialos’s Athens office.&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/greek_economic_crisis_by_latuff.jpg.w300h338.jpg" alt="greek_economic_crisis_by_latuff.jpg" width="300" /><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;In response to the rumors of the recent days it was emphasized by all that Greece is an integral part of the eurozone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Greece is determined to meet all its commitments to its partners, ensuring in this way the full implementation of the support program.</p>
<p>&#8220;The decisions taken by the Cabinet in recent days and the additional measures announced lead to meeting fiscal targets for 2011 and 2012 and the creation of primary surpluses. This will fortify the Greek economy, relieve the public debt burden and reinforce the country’s growth prospects.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The distinctive difference and shortfall of the Euro from the U.S. Dollar (actually Federal Reserve note) is that the former is competing money, to the later world’s reserve currency status. No restraint is in effect that prevents mandatory acceptance of the U.S. Dollar as settlement payment, since creating unlimited credits is the prerogative of the reserve currency. As long as regimes fear their own demise from either bombing drones or the ending of new credit, the shell game continues.</p>
<p>Therefore, when U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner backs an American infusion of even more debt created Dollars to rescue the EU banking system, you know the race to the bottom has begun. <a href="http://dailybail.com/home/bernanke-to-the-rescue-in-euro-bailout-redux-european-christ.html">Market Watch</a> reports, &#8220;The European Central Bank, the Bank of England, Bank of Japan, and the Swiss National Bank announced they will each conduct additional dollar tenders in an effort to provide liquidity through the end of the year. The central banks said the auctions are coordinated with each other and the U.S. Federal Reserve.&#8221;This effort will not alter the fundamental plight that faces Europe. As the crunch intensifies, Greece will be sacked. If the <a href="http://www.reportage-enviro.com/2009/12/british-museum-still-refusing-to-return-parthenon-pieces/">British Museum</a> refuses to return the Parthenon, or Elgin Marbles, what would make anyone think that the byzantine Brussels bureaucracy would share any of the renowned fairness and compassion of the goddess Athena? Annihilating Greek democracy is all in a day’s work for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission">European Commission</a>.</p>
<p>So what is the proposed EU solution? European Commission president<a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20110914-eurozone-crisis-could-rip-eu-apart-officials-0">Jose Manuel Barroso</a> announces,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;He will &#8220;soon&#8221; present proposals for eurozone states to issue joint bonds, a way to even out interest rates among the single currency area&#8217;s 17 nations. Such &#8220;eurobonds&#8221; are currently opposed by Germany and could require a new round of painful EU treaty negotiations.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/15/us-eurozone-eurobonds-idUSTRE78E1BF20110915">Reuters</a> lays out the conflict. &#8220;Germany, which is the euro zone&#8217;s most powerful economy and enjoys the lowest sovereign borrowing costs, would stand to lose most if such bonds were introduced as it would effectively end up having to underwrite weaker, more risky member states. As a result, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is adamantly opposed.&#8221;It needs to be recognized that the German economy is the only thread that keeps the EU alive. The political reality is that what Germany could not conquer militarily, she accomplished by way of her industry and positive trade balances.</p>
<p>Examine two separate <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/15/us-eurozone-eurobonds-idUSTRE78E1BF20110915">bond proposals</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>1) Bruegel, a Brussels-based think-tank whose research frequently informs EU policy, last year put forward a proposal for separate &#8216;red&#8217; and &#8216;blue&#8217; bonds. Under the plan, euro zone bonds &#8212; blue bonds &#8212; would be issued jointly and collectively up to the value of 60 percent of each euro zone member state&#8217;s gross domestic product (GDP). Borrowing beyond that level would require an individual state to issue red bonds without the collective guarantee of the euro zone, with the market likely to charge a higher yield to reflect the additional risk.</p>
<p>The disparity in financing costs between blue and red bonds &#8212; potentially, a jump of more than 50 percent by some estimates &#8212; would be a big incentive for euro zone countries to bring their debts rapidly down to below 60 percent of GDP, the limit originally targeted by the EU.</p>
<p>2) Separately, Berlin-based economist Hans-Joachim Dubel has proposed creating European sovereign bonds &#8212; dubbed &#8216;purple&#8217; bonds &#8212; that are part-insured by the EU&#8217;s rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).</p>
<p>Each bond would be split into senior and junior tranches, with the senior section, around 60 percent of the total, insured by the EFSF and its successor, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).</p>
<p>The ESM would become a monoline bond insurer that in the event of a default would pay investors quickly and in full on 60 percent of their assets, while the junior debt could be restructured. Such junior debt could trade separately after a default.</p>
<p>The dual structure of the bond would mean sovereigns are charged a higher interest rate than for blue bonds, reflecting the implicit 40 percent first loss carried by the uninsured junior tranche. So the mechanism would still provide an incentive to avoid excessive debt issuance when times are good.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not hard to envision why Angela Merkel is reluctant to turn over the fruits of a German work ethic and advanced engineering to subsidize a continent of fainéant ingrates.</p>
<p>So where will the money come from to rollover existing government debt or finance the additional sums required to keep the socialist experiment intact? The globalists have an answer, their own ingenious Reich, called China. The Chinese communists are the ultimate banksters’ tool. Their model for economic control is the product of the same clan of London and New York financiers who set the stage for European conflicts designed to move the planet into a vortex of their intention.</p>
<p>The Globe and Mail offers up this account.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Chinese Premier <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-news/china-sets-conditions-for-increased-eu-debt-support/article2165291/">Wen Jiabao</a> has outlined conditions that Europe must meet before China will increase support for debt-laden Europe in a sign of Beijing’s reluctance to be cast as a savior for the global economy.His top condition was the long-standing demand that Europe recognize China as a full &#8220;market economy,&#8221; a technical definition that would benefit Chinese companies involved in trade disputes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The McClatchy-Tribune Information Service also reports.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As the global economy slowly recovers, we still face a host of uncertainties and destabilizing factors,&#8221; <a href="http://news.tradingcharts.com/futures/8/1/164874418.html">Wen Jiabao</a> said at the opening of the World Economic Forum&#8217;s meeting in the north-eastern port of Dalian.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under these circumstances, the Chinese economy is closely linked with the global economy,&#8221; he told 1,500 delegates from 90 nations at the meeting that has come to be known as the &#8220;Summer Davos.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The way to view the Chinese money machine needs to acknowledge that the globalists want to use the same coolie labor structure for the entire world. Europe is slated to adopt the type of a New World Order that strips all sovereignty from individual countries. China has an undemocratic culture and a rigidly proscribed regiment for political dissenters. The bondage of European debt financed by a PRC slave system is straight out the funding of the Nazi regime playbook.</p>
<p>When Wen Jiabao patronizes the EU, he is instructing the masses to accept the dictates of the EU Commission. The purpose of keeping the phony bond obligations roll over scheme is to use the extortion payments for additional real assets acquisitions and control by the very bankers that designed the collapsing and fake international trading framework.</p>
<p>EU beggars acquiesce to tyrants. Their long record of internal conflict seldom focuses on the underlying masters of the financial fraud. China is the new capital of the banksters’ Babylon. Its location is an armed camp and protectorate of the <a href="http://batr.org/foreignpolicy.html">Mattiods</a>. Their assets are the direct result of the global free trade deception.</p>
<p>The best hope for Europe is that Germany, not Greece, leave the EU. As long as Eastern Europeans and Middle East immigrants clamor to tap into the wealth of &#8220;Teutonic Fatherland&#8221;, the notion of a United States of Europe will suffer from the same invasion and fate as America. &#8220;<em>He, who learns but does not think, is lost! He who thinks but does not learn is in great danger</em>.&#8221; - Confucius</p>

				<p>June 14, 2011 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=11263#respond" title="Comment on How The Media Covers Bilderberg Meetings"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="11263 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=11263">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/bilderbergconspiracy3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/bilderbergconspiracy2.jpg" alt="" /></a>The mainstream media blackout of the annual Bilderberg meeting is finally crumbling. Yet the prevarication machine continues to reinforce the delusional official line from on high. For decades, the sinister world cabal operated in the shadows of secrecy and disinformation. The timely analogy is the initial way the disgraced Anthony Weiner responded to his self-inflicted indiscretion. Ignore any rogue inquiry about the nature of their agenda or plots on forthcoming plans. High-handedness is the hallmark of their demeanor, just as arrogance is the basic character component of this pit-bull Congressional egomaniac.</p>
<p>For the world’s most powerful elites, Bilderberg meetings are not sessions of chance. Peccadillos in personal affairs often are the norm, but when it comes to controlling the planet, only a strictly managed media message is acceptable. Now that the original denial, ala area 51 nonexistent ploys no longer flies, desperate PR spinning, surfaces. Public apathy used to fuel the secrecy of Bilderberg discussions and decisions. However, media silence was the engine that kept the sleight of hand deception pointing in a different direction.</p>
<p><img src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/anthony-weiner-cartoon-weinergate-598x561.jpg.w300h281.jpg" />Weiner everyday and all day long, is symptomatic of the celebrity culture built to keep people living lives of utter desperation. As the government education experiment achieved undisputed success in destroying independent and coherent thought, the Bilderberg overlords felt confident that there would be little blowback to their <a href="http://www.batr.org/totalitariancollectivism/index.html">totalitarian collectivism</a>. Nevertheless, the rapid obliteration of economic and social society is the harsh reality, no longer concealed, from even the most brain dead serf. Case in point is that large media conglomerates cannot exhort their version of political news in the homogeneous manner once enjoyed. Readership and ratings forecast a dying dinosaur.</p>
<p>CNBC is a good example of unwatchable propaganda. Corporatist’s cheerleaders write the business reporting. An article by Peter Guest Rich, <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/43325286">Famous and Powerful Converge at Bilderberg</a> spins the truly ridiculous.</p>
<blockquote><p>Andrew Kakabadse is professor of international management development at Cranfield University. For his recent book &#8220;Bilderberg People,&#8221; co-authored with Nada Kakabadse and Ian Richardson, Kakabadse interviewed a number of past attendees in order to understand how the network of global influence works.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people we talked to are quite genuine. Mostly they don&#8217;t understand the conspiracy bit, because they say when you go there what you find is people of all sorts of varying views. But the fact that they&#8217;ve been invited is indicative of the position that they&#8217;ve reached in life,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the world teeters on a fabricated collapse of incalculable debt, the Bilderberg consortium readies the next escalated stage of enslavement. The good news is that a capitalist tool media outlet is beingforced to play a frantic cover-up for their sponsors. If you think that GE really sold off controlling interest of their media empire, the same &#8220;global enterprise&#8221; of acceptable current events proceeds according to their master designs. The schedule or tactics may alter, but the goal is constant.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.whale.to/b/allen_b1.html">None dare call it conspiracy</a> is still a required &#8220;PC&#8221; composite mindset to get on air. Thinking people know better and call it reality history. In the nearly forty years since Gary Allen wrote his influential book, more citizens have come to understand the nature of pervasive globalism. However, the technological procession towards dependent regimentation is frightening. The wild card in the mix of communication is the internet. Plutocrats are unable to stamp out dissent on the internet. The effective ability to expose, challenge and resist Bilderberg grand scheme causes is these oligarchs’ deepest concern and is a prime objective for elimination.</p>
<p>When an individual awakens from their induced slumber, grass roots activism has the potential to blossom. Mark Dice has a <a href="http://youtu.be/ispfpnc6FG0">video</a> that suggests a simple strategy in, Pressuring the mainstream media to cover Bilderberg 2011. The key word is PRESSURE.The Drudge Report is setting the real news cycle. Linking to Bilderberg items gets traction. Coverage from the likes of the Alex Jones team is at an all time high. Insider reporting from Jim Tucker is unstoppable. The excuses for remaining ignorant are few. People need to alter their pathetic lifestyle and act upon all this information.</p>
<p>The targeting of activists as terrorists is a basic strategy of the globalist cowards. Apply an elementary test to this outlook. The <a href="http://www.infowars.com/bilderberg-2009-attendee-list/">list</a> of recent <a href="http://restoretherepublic.com/top-stories/the-2010-bilderberg-participant-list.html">attendees</a> to Bilderberg meetings is readily available. These tyrants continue to live privileged lives. Their physical safety is seldom if ever challenged. Their protective measures are formidable. You seldom hear or read about protesters penetrating their private cocoon. In an older age the chant, off with their heads would be acted upon. However, the prey for violent terrorism never includes these elites as objects of harm.The hoax of terrorism, shaped by these elites, only serves their interests. The essence of the threat of extremist oppression originates at the Bilderberg conferences. Since they are virtually immune from terrorist attacks, it is insulting to think that unfeigned militants would leave the Bilderberg clan off the list for retaliation. When the phony media reports that our very existence depends upon exterminating terrorists, they intentionally point to the wrong suspects.</p>
<p>The Anthony Weiner pattern of unaccountable and patronizing behavior demonstrates a sickness in the political class. Required resignation from office for lying in the post Bill Clinton era has become only an option. Even the minimal standard of public shame does not apply to Bilderberg Mattoids. Disgraced politicians may eventually leave or not run for re-election, but if you are on the Bilderberg approved blueblood list, your influence and assignment in the globalist scheme continues.</p>
<p>Weiner gate is not substantial news. It is the typical New York City <a href="http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Metrosexual">Metrosexual</a> story of being sexually excited by eggs or maybe Weiner’s wife, Huma Abedin is just a hen. According to the changeling Chris Matthews in &#8220;<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2011/06/06/chris_matthews_on_weiners_wife_maybe_shes_partly_responsible.html">Maybe She&#8217;s Partly Responsible</a>&#8221; Matthews believes Rep. Anthony Weiner&#8217;s wife may be &#8220;partly responsible&#8221; for his sexual misconduct because the Congressman said she was aware of his behavior before they were married. Transcript below:</p>
<blockquote><p>CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC: &#8220;Yeah, but he says his wife knew. He laid it out on her.&#8221;</p>
<p>JOHN FEEHERY, Republican strategist: &#8220;Which is a terrible, terrible mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>MATTHEWS: &#8220;Well, maybe she&#8217;s partly responsible if she knew about it?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The irrelevance of the Weiner scandal in the greater scheme of things should be self-evident. But what is the responsibility of the typical subjugated slave living on the global plantation, when they know that the Bilderberg elites manipulate the despotic hegemony?</p>
<p><iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/uTKRzhcZ3fQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Mark Anderson from the American Free Press <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTKRzhcZ3fQ">video</a> gives a succinct outline.</p>
<p>Steve Watson’s point in the report, <a href="http://www.infowars.com/dear-mainstream-media-we-think-you-might-want-to-cover-this%e2%80%a6/">Dear Mainstream Media, We Think You Might Want To Cover This</a>… states the obvious about attendee:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221; . . . Jeff Bezos, Founder and CEO of Amazon.com, Chris R. Hughes, Co-founder of Facebook, Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Google, Craig J. Mundie, Chief Research and Strategy Officer at Microsoft Corporation, and Reid Hoffman, Co-founder and Executive Chairman of LinkedIn.</p>
<p>That alone should be enough to focus the attention of the mainstream media.</p>
<p>Alas, apparently, no, that is not enough to perk their collective interest.</p>
<p>Then lets factor in that also in attendance are the Vice President of the European Commission, the President of the European Council, the Director General of the World Trade Organization, the President of the European Central Bank, the President of The World Bank, and the Executive Director of the United Nations World Food Programme.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/Bilderberg-300x266.jpg" alt="Bilderberg-300x266.jpg"  />The <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-mainmenu-26/europe-mainmenu-35/7791-elite-bilderberg-2011-meeting-draws-scrutiny">New American</a> draws attention that the blackout stranglehold is softening.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Other mainstream reports, however, were more friendly to Bilderberg critics. &#8220;It&#8217;s a shame the attendees are still so phobic of attention, seeing as how this year there&#8217;s shaping up to be more press interest than ever. People and the media have finally started noticing this quiet little conference at the centre of the storm,&#8221; noted a piece in the U.K. Guardian, pointing out that the cabal played a crucial role in the creation of the European Union.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Smart money says that Texas Gov. Rick Perry is the anointed Bilderberg selection to butte heads against Obama. His praises in an <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2011/06/is_perry_the_one.html">American Thinker</a> article seems opportune. Yet the political horse race is even more immaterial than the distraction of a <em>weiner gone wild</em>. Nevertheless, the corporatists’ media preoccupations with meaningless elections deserve mention when a menacingjunto shapes the political process.Oppressed people of the world need to force the media into a &#8220;commune state of shame&#8221; for protecting Bilderberg sociopaths. A spontaneous effort of applying pressure on the organizations that own and set reporting on programming content is a starting point. Escalation to a national boycott of their media venues and advertising revenue is the common language these elites understand. MSNBC Chris Matthews is a prime enabler who needs to learn the meaning of &#8220;<em>I am partly responsible because I knew about Bilderberg</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p>The continual breakdown of society is a designed result of the global elites. Each of us has a responsibility to take this warning to friends, family and strangers alike. Become your own <em>media message</em> and use every means of non-violent resistance as a model for your gospel of universal liberation.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The National Security Agency (NSA) is a combat support agency within the Department of Defense (DOD) established by presidential directive in 1952. NSA has two separate missions: signals intelligence and communications security. For signals intelligence, NSA manages all U.S. signal collection and processing and produces signals intelligence in accordance with DOD and DCI priorities. For communications security, NSA provides leadership, products, and services to U.S. agencies that need to protect their information and communication systems from foreign exploitation. NSA is headed by a three-star flag officer, who reports to the Secretary of Defense. About 80 percent of the NSA workforce is civilian.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>A relative comparison, back in 1996 and pre 911 government of the size and disclosed budgets of intelligence agencies, indicates the colossal scope of the NSA. Casual public observers got an introduction to the world of surreptitious surveillance in the movie<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enemy_of_the_State_(film)"> Enemy of the State</a> or from news reports that their smart phones are actually tracking devices, even when turned off. But an unbelievably weird episode of freakish propositions, resembling a flick<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_Who_Stare_at_Goats">The Men Who Stare at Goats</a> sequel gone mad, lurks in the bowels of restricted files on an <a href="http://techie-buzz.com/online-security/speculation-nsa-building-exaflop-supercomputer.html">Exaflop Supercomputer</a>.</p>
<p>Have you ever head of <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/aquino.html">Lt. Col. Michael A. Aquino</a>? <a href="http://labvirus.wordpress.com/2010/04/05/photos-of-col-michael-a-aquinos-front-door-in-san-francisco/">Aquino</a> as high priest of the temple of set, arguably the world’s most prolific satanic institution and a former disciple of Anton LaVey (founder of First Church of Satan), is reportedly a master psychic, good at psionics, and rumored the highest ranking member of the NSA. The NSA site <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/about/leadership/former_directors.shtml">lists former Directors</a> and has <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/about/leadership/index.shtml">General Keith B. Alexander</a>, United States Army as the current head of the agency.</p>
<p>Are we supposed to believe that a devil worshipper can serve at the highest levels of the military industrial security complex? Can such claims be credible?</p>
<p>View the video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpaotRvwoJ0&amp;feature=player_embedded">Michael Aquino, Satanic Mind-Control Cults</a> and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=IL150uJIVHA/lat=21">Aquino NSA</a> connection to enrich your confidence in the work of the intelligence communities. Bizarre at the least, but Jeffrey Steinberg of Executive Intelligence Review sheds light on <a href="http://www.xeper.org/maquino/nm/MindWar.pdf">From PSYOP to MindWar: The Psychology of Victory</a> in <a href="http://www.mindpowernews.com/MindWar.htm">How Military PsyOps Plan to Control your Mind</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The &#8220;MindWar&#8221; paper was disturbing, for reasons beyond its fascistic and occultist content. For one thing, Colonel Vallely&#8217;s co-author was a PSYOP Research &amp; Analysis Team Leader named Maj. Michael A. Aquino.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Vallely and Aquino&#8217;s MindWar scheme is remarkably similar to the Total Information Awareness (TIA) program launched by the Donald Rumsfeld Pentagon, under the direction of Irangate figure Adm. John Poindexter. Ostensibly, the Total Information Awareness global propaganda and mega-data-mining plan was scrapped after a series of negative news stories, but Pentagon sources have reported that the program was merely &#8220;taken into a black box.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Watch the video about this military <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5zfrdwh1QY&amp;feature=player_embedded">Mind War paper</a> and then <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QfJyC5r3jM&amp;feature=player_embedded">EDUCATE YOURSELF: PROJECT BLUEBEAM</a> for the application of the tenants of these projects.Aquino writes in November 2003 in the introduction addendum to his original <a href="http://www.xeper.org/maquino/nm/MindWar.pdf">Mind War</a> paper the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With the arising of the Internet in the 1980s, however, Mind War received an entirely unexpected &#8211; and somewhat comic &#8211; resurrection. Allusions to it gradually proliferated, with its &#8220;sinister&#8221; title quickly winning it the most lurid, conspiracy-theory reputation. The rumor mill soon had it transformed into an Orwellian blueprint for Manchurian Candidate mind control and world domination. My own image as an occult personality added fuel to the wildfire: Mind War was now touted by the lunatic fringe as conclusive proof that the Pentagon was awash in Black Magic and Devil-worship.</p>
<p>Now that this absurdly comic opera has at least somewhat subsided, I thought that it might be interesting to make a complete and accurate copy of the paper available, together with an Introduction and some historical-hindsight annotations to place it in reasonable context. After all it did &#8211; and perhaps still does &#8211; have something worthwhile to say.</p>
<p>Within the U.S. military, PSYOP has habitually been relegated to a back-seat as a &#8220;force multiplier&#8221;. The principal strategic decisions are made in consideration of traditional political and military interests and goals. Only then is PSYOP invited to the table, to help achieve already-agreed-upon missions more efficiently.</p>
<p>MindWar reverses this sequence. Psychological means for achieving victory &#8211; essentially through convincing the enemy that he really wants to bring his national policies into harmony with ours &#8211; are fashioned in support of basic political goals. The use of &#8220;ordinary&#8221; military force (bombs, bullets, etc.) is regarded as a &#8220;last resort&#8221; in circumstances wherein MindWar by itself fails&#8221;.</p>
<p>The crucial question avoided by the military and intelligence community is who actually is the enemy? The recent announcement of the top brass switch at CIA and the Department of Defense illustrates that the wheels of coordinated policy remain the same. The<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/petraeus-would-helm-an-increasingly-militarized-cia/2011/04/27/AFwoDM1E_story_1.html">Washington Post</a> reports, &#8220;Petraeus’s nomination triggered some grumbling among CIA veterans opposed to putting a career military officer in charge of an agency with a long tradition of civilian leadership.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The funnel effect of protecting favored covert projects and sharing denial of information among agencies continues. But, what never ceases is the onward march for greater control over the minds and behavior of citizens, since they are seen as the enemy of the totalitarian Pentagon structure that obeys the unlawful orders of their oligarchic masters. If this system of false patriotism is not Devil-worship, then what would you call devotion to a technocratic regime that directs their surveillance apparatus as a means to deceive and subjugate the local population?</p>
<p>The NSA is more dangerous to the ordinary citizen than the clandestine operatives that play their spy games. PSYOP is more pervasive domestically than internationally. The target of the black art that NSA electronics employ is designed to read your email, listen to your phones and monitor your travel activities. Cyberspace databases are core functions that the National Security Agency uses to create achieves on individuals. Just who are the lunatics when a government routinely monitors every aspect of behavior?</p>
<p><img src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/GeneralMichaelAquino.jpg" alt="GeneralMichaelAquino.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="0" align="Right" /></p>
<p>Allowing a wing nut like Aquino access to the secretive corridors of cryptologic intelligence might seem strange, but promoting PSYOP as a useful tool against domestic populations is the very definition of a sinister society.</p>
<p>The mere idea that a Project Bluebeam is a plausible strategy option in the PSYOP world of government officials should scare the bejesus out of you.<a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Is-Project-Bluebeam-the-Grand-Deception">Project Bluebeam</a> is designed to usher in the New World Order with a one-world government, a one-world army, a one-world religion, a cashless society and micro-chipped populations controlled by a central computer. The elite of the world would not be subject to this fascist control system but would run it and enjoy its spoils.The NSA is well positioned to do the housekeeping of the database. If a Michael Aquino is part of the military information management infrastructure used to be the data depository of centralized regimentation, why would it be so preposterous for that same government to use satanic practices in the performance of their assignments?</p>
<p>Rational individuals, schooled in historic investigation, should not automatically dismiss the length and depths that evil rulers use to enslave societies. If the subject of mind control interests you, consider a review of the <a href="http://www.apfn.org/apfn/mc.htm">NSA Mind Control and Psyops</a>. The theme of this material addresses methods used to influence and manipulate thinking and behavior.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Subliminal Implanted Posthypnotic Suggestions and Scripts Using Acoustically Delivered and Phonetically Accelerated Posthypnotic Commands without Somnambulistic Preparation in the Subject for Intelligence and Counterintelligence Applications by the United States National Security Agency.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Another source to review is <a href="http://www.rense.com/political/weapons/nsa.html">Domestic Surveillance and Mind Control Technology</a>. Under NSA Signals Intelligence Use of EMF Brain Stimulation, another diabolical technique is examined.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Without any contact with the subject, Remote Neural Monitoring can map out electrical activity from the visual cortex of a subject&#8217;s brain and show images from the subject&#8217;s brain on a video monitor. NSA operatives see what the surveillance subject&#8217;s eyes are seeing. Visual memory can also be seen. RNM can send images direct to the visual cortex, bypassing the eyes and optic nerves. NSA operatives can use this to surreptitiously put images in a surveillance subject&#8217;s brain while they are in R.E.M. sleep for brain-programming purposes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The NSA Ft. Meade complex is more imposing than the CIA Langley operation. The illicit skullduggery and <a href="http://ionamiller.weebly.com/sub-rosa-skullduggery.html">Sub Rosa</a> elements that dominate your lives are occult disciples. Aquino may just be idolizing what other NSA practitioners are hiding beyond closed doors. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120660/quotes">Thomas Reynolds</a>, played by Jon Voight in <a href="http://batr.org/flicks.html">Enemy of the State</a> said: &#8220;The only privacy that&#8217;s left is the inside of your head&#8221;, may have been asleep at the switch during his RNM sessions.</p>
