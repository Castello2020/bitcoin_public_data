<p>A reader emailed me, “Mr. Wooldridge, everything you write about on immigration, population and environment is coming true. It makes me sick for my children.”</p>
<p>NBC anchor Brian Williams said last Friday, “Meteorologists reported that 62 percent of California suffers from extreme drought.  That state stands in the middle of a water emergency.”</p>
<p>Additionally, forest fires rage across the state while burning down homes and schools in their path.</p>
<p>If you look back on my Part 4 of “What America will look like in 2050—acute water predicament”, I talked about seven states in 2014 suffering from water shortages.</p>
<p>My question: why do hundreds of thousands of people build houses in fire burn-zones?  Answer: because California proves our most overpopulated state, 38 million people forces them to encroach on the wilderness without pause.  Amazingly, California faces an added 20 million people to smother more of the land with houses, asphalt, concrete, malls, airports, schools and accelerating air pollution.</p>
<p>Most of what I address in my columns manifests faster than I imagined.  In my book, America on the Brink: The Next Added 100 Million Americans, leads off with California being the “Bow of the Titanic of America.” </p>
<p>Why? Answer: within 30 years, California will absorb over 20 million more people; 90 percent of them from legal immigration.</p>
<p>If they suffer extreme drought in 2014 replete with forest fires and water shortages for their 38 million residents, can you imagine what California faces in three decades when they jump from 38 million to 58 million?</p>
<p>Does anyone in the media or Washington DC understand the “enormity” of our predicament?  Answer: not a chance. Williams, Sawyer, Pelley, Blitzer, Charlie Rose, David Gregory, Shepard Smith, 60 Minutes producers and the rest of them run like scalded rabbits away from the population-immigration issue.</p>
<p>Yet, it’s coming and it’s coming fast.  Senate Bill 744, the amnesty for 12-20 million illegal migrants increased legal immigration from 1 million to 2 million annually.  If California’s problems aren’t bad enough already, Washington politicians and Obama vote to make them doubly worse doubly fast.</p>
<p>Almost 99 percent of California faces abnormally dry weather or worse; almost two-thirds of the state suffers extreme drought. The year 2013 became the driest year on record in California.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think the drought emphasizes that we do live in an era of limits, that nature has its boundaries.” — Gov. Jerry Brown, California</p></blockquote>
<p>Brown urged voluntary water conservation to the tune of a 20 percent reduction.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to be ready for a long, continuous, persistent effort, including the possibility of drinking-water shortages,” he said. &#8220;I think the drought emphasizes that we do live in an era of limits, that nature has its boundaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With a hotter and drier future, we can&#8217;t duplicate water policies of the 20th century to address challenges of the 21st,&#8221; said Senator Fran Pavley, a Democrat, from Agoura Hills in Southern California. &#8220;We need to be resourceful and create new water supplies with cost-effective, sustainable strategies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notice none of them speak about the impact of adding 20 million immigrants. Not to mention the 100 million overall landing in America from endless immigration! They refuse to look at the long-term picture.  They ignore the fact that they have too many people with too little water.</p>
<p>While I took great pains to write about what America will look like in 2050 with an added 100 million more immigrants, the leaders of this country refuse to look at the ramifications facing our children.  You can expect those 36 years to fly by in a blink.</p>
<p>While the politicians in Washington DC won’t deal with it, the American people remain as clueless as a pot of geraniums left out in the hot sun in Arizona while the owners left on vacation with no provision to water them.</p>
<p>Result: the geraniums die from lack of water. Once they die, nothing brings them back.</p>
<p>Once those 100 million immigrants land on the USA, nothing can change our fate. </p>
<blockquote><p>“The crisis of our diminishing water resources is just as severe (if less obviously immediate) as any wartime crisis we have ever faced. Our survival is just as much at stake as it was at the time of Pearl Harbor, or the Argonne, or Gettysburg, or Saratoga.” &#8211; Jim Wright, U.S. Representative, The Coming Water Famine, 1966</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead of our country remaining the land of plenty, we face becoming yet another conflicted, water-scarce and struggling civilization because we failed to act when we should have acted.</p>
<p>Eleanor Roosevelt said it 50 years ago; “We must prevent human tragedy rather than run around trying to save ourselves after an event has already occurred.  Unfortunately, history clearly shows that we arrive at catastrophe by failing to meet the situation, by failing to act when we should have acted.  The opportunity passes us by and the next disaster is always more difficult and compounded than the last one.” </p>
<p>You can act collectively to stop mass immigration from continuing:  share these two videos with every citizen in America that show what we face and what we must do to stop it.</p>

<p><em>Damascus</em> &#8211; At the Palestine Embassy in Beirut recently, a young lady showed this observer a video of a gentleman in Yarmouk camp in Damascus. The video showed the man killing and eating a cat. Food ran out in Yarmouk weeks ago, and nearly 18,000 refugees are facing death from starvation and other conflict-related causes. This siege has been ongoing since July 2013, and it has become viciously lethal.</p>
<p>The Palestinians living here have been targeted. They are part of the quarter million people—children, women, and men—trapped and dying from hunger and illness all across Syria as a direct, predictable result of using the siege of civilians as a weapon of war. It isn’t just Yarmouk. Throughout Syria, neighborhoods are being blockaded. Residents are running out of supplies, unable to get basic services. Among the Syrian towns under siege at this time are Nubul and Al-Zahraa in Aleppo province, the old city of Homs, and the towns of Eastern Ghouta, Daraya and Moadamiyet al-Sham in rural Damascus. </p>
<p>Truly a crisis of horrifying proportions, yet perhaps nowhere is this more the case than in the systematic starvation of Palestinian refugees in Yarmouk camp, where this past week eight more Palestinians died from malnutrition. These include 80-year-old, Jamil al-Qurabi, 40-year-old, Hasan Shihabi, and a 50-year-old woman named Noor. In addition, 10-year-old Mahmoud al-Sabbagh and two 19-year-olds—Majid Imad Awad and Ziad al-Naji—were killed while protesting the blockade of the camp. And reports have also emerged that two other men, Muhammad Ibrahim Dhahi and Hasan Younis Nofal, were tortured and killed.</p>
<p>In December 2013, UNRWA Commissioner-General Filippo Grandi, issued a statement concerning the situation in Yarmouk camp, in which he said: &#8220;Since September 2013 we have been unable to enter the area to deliver desperately needed relief supplies.”</p>
<p>Based on conversations with Palestinians who were able to literally crawl out of the area from sewage pipes on the South side of Yarmouk, more than 100 people, as of 1/15/14, have died from starvation in the past four months—that is since mid-August 2013. Other causes of death have included three dozen cases of death by dehydration, and also malnutrition (differing slightly from starvation in that it pertains to inadequate nutrition rather than a total absence of ingestible substances) (you still die from it, though). More than three dozen miscarriages have also resulted from the food shortages, while infants have succumbed due to lack of milk. There have also been deaths by hypothermia for lack of fuel, and recently I spoke with a gentleman whose niece, an infant girl, died of suffocation in her neonatal intensive care unit due to a power cut.</p>
<p>In January of 2013 the UN estimated that one million people needed urgent humanitarian assistance. Today, twelve months later, the figure is nearly ten million. That assessment is from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who spoke last week at yet another aid conference. A commission of inquiry set up by the UN Human Rights Council has found war crimes, crimes against humanity, and gross human rights violations committed in Syria on a daily basis. According to its conclusion, “All sides in the conflict have shown a total disregard for their responsibilities under the international humanitarian and human rights law.&#8221;</p>
<p>International law relevant to situations of this nature was created specifically to stop the targeting of civilians. Its principles, standards and rules demand that such targeting cease, and they call for the prosecution of perpetrators irrespective of which side in the civil war in Syria they may support. A civil war is an armed conflict located on the territory of one state, between the armed forces of the State and dissident armed forces or other organized armed groups under responsible command. These are groups that maintain control over part of the land, or that are able to carry out armed operations of a continuous and coordinated nature. The applicable statutes include Common Article 3 of Protocol II (1977) the Geneva Conventions of 1949. Whether it is regime armed forces and their allies, or anti-government militia, both are legally bound to respect the Geneva Conventions and must lift the siege on Yarmouk. If not, they risk prosecution at an existing international court or at a possible Special Tribunal for Syria being contemplated among some at the United Nations.</p>
<p>The following is from Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949: Part IV: Civilian Population:</p>
<p>Article 13.PROTECTION OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. </p>
<ol>
<li>The civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations. </li>
<p>To give effect to this protection, the following rules shall be observed in all circumstances. </p>
<li>The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack. Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited. </li>
<li>Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this Part, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 14. PROTECTION OF OBJECTS INDISPENSABLE TO THE SURVIVAL OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. Starvation of civilians as a method of combat is prohibited. It is therefore prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless, for that purpose, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as food stuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works. </p>
<p>Article 15. PROTECTION OF WORKS AND INSTALLATIONS CONTAINING DANGEROUS FORCES. Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.</p>
<p>This body of international law requires that all warring parties immediately end the siege of Yarmouk and allow the entry of food supplies, while permitting those who want to leave the camp to do so. The safety of those who wish to return to their homes is also mandated. Additionally the law requires guarantees of safe passages to relief teams, UN fact finding missions, and unobstructed entry of medicines, medical staff and medical equipment. Those today who are preventing this are subject to international criminal prosecution, and as noted above, they are subject to future prosecution at any time, as the level and nature of their crimes prevent the application of any Statute of Limitations.</p>
<p>According to human rights activists, attempts to evacuate civilians from Yarmouk camp failed in spite of efforts and agreements between the Syrian government and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). Those attempting to leave were arrested, in some cases with serious bodily and mental harm inflicted on them. Others were shot at near the camp’s entry points. This occurred particularly in the last two months of 2013 and early January 2014. Several agreements between the warring parties, being the Syrian government forces and the rebels assaulting Yarmouk, have not been honored by either. Attempts to evacuate civilians from Yarmouk have consistently failed in spite of efforts and agreements between the regime and the PLO, and some who attempted escape were arrested, beaten or shot at. </p>
<p>The several attempts to lift the siege usually include versions of the following language from Yarmouk’s Popular Committee that “based on our principled position of positive neutrality and keeping the Palestinians and their camps out of the confrontations in Syria, we propose that all the Palestinian camps – and Yarmouk camp in particular – be secure and safe areas, free of weapons and fighters, by taking the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>End all public display of weapons and fighters, with guarantees to those who wish to do so.</li>
<li>Avoid the use of the camps as areas of confrontation and cease all forms of fighting, including sniping and shelling.</li>
<li>Allow the free movement of people, food, medical supplies and vehicles in and out of the camp, which will encourage the return of the displaced to their homes.</li>
<li>Restore services, including electricity, water, telecommunications, schools, and hospitals.</li>
<li>Provide amnesty to all those camp residents who have been detained if their involvement in the fighting cannot be confirmed.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite an official policy of neutrality announced by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and despite also unequivocal statements by Palestinian delegations acquitting the regime of any responsibility in the besieging, bombing and targeting of the camp and its inhabitants, it has not been enough to ensure the entry of humanitarian aid convoys. </p>
<p>But there is hope that relief may come. Against the backdrop of accusations and condemnations being circulated, many are looking to Russia to step in and, much as it did when it induced the Assad government to get rid of its chemical weapons, pressure the government to at least lift its own part of the siege. </p>
<p>There are critics of the idea, however. Mr. Ibrahim Amin, Editor in Chief of Lebanon’s Al Akbar daily newspaper, argues that somehow because Palestinians have been given many more civil rights in Syria than, for example, Lebanon—which to Syria’s great credit is true—then the refugees must somehow be at fault for their own slaughter and siege at Yarmouk. It is nonsense, of course, as also is his statement that, “In Syria, Palestinians were citizens.”—nonsense because, for example, Palestinians cannot vote in Syrian elections. Amin should know this, and he should know that they have never been made citizens of Syria, for this is common knowledge.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, writing in the January 13 issue of his newspaper, Editor Amin piles blame on the victims, rather than the perpetrators, by seeming to argue that they deserved it—the babies dying of malnutrition, the people suffering from dehydration and disease caused by the siege of their camp. He demands to know, “What pushed Palestinians in this camp to believe in toppling Bashar al-Assad? No sane person ever figured that much of the camp would raise their weapons in the face of Syria.”</p>
<p>More nonsense from the Editor-in-Chief since virtually every Palestinian organization and leader, and virtually every resident living in any one of UNWRA’s 54 camps, including the ten in Syria, have repeatedly proclaimed their non-involvement in the Syria conflict. Presumably in his line of work Mr. Amin would know this. And presumably, if he took the time to speak to any Palestinians about the conflict in Syria, he would likely be advised that they are grateful to the Syrian people for hosting them. He might also be advised that they regret that some of their leaders got involved with the conflict in Iraq under Saddam Hussein, since innocent Palestinian civilians paid dearly, and that they will not repeat the mistake in Syria. It is a fact that some individual Palestinians, following the intense December 12-17, 2012 shelling and bombing of parts of Yarmouk, turned against those who were blamed for targeting them.</p>
<p>“Those who stayed are the ones who refused to go through a new displacement, as well as members of armed groups and their families,” Mr. Amin states, though without offering any evidence. He goes on: “In a few months the camp was transformed into a haven for groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and al-Nusra Front.” Again his assertions are false and politically motivated. Those who stayed are overwhelmingly those refugees who cannot escape. The Syrian army to its credit has not invaded the camp, but it does surround and seals most of it. Some rebel groups are hiding inside and terrorizing the camp.</p>
<p>It is egregious for Mr. Amin to misrepresent the facts of Palestinian neutrality in Syrian camps; it is doubly egregious for him to do so apparently wishing to gain approval from Syrian or Resistance leaders. Neither is likely to be other than embarrassed by Mr. Amin’s gross misrepresentations or his gratuitous ad hominem attacks on refugee camp victims of war crimes. The Editor-in-Chief’s distortions do not help the Resistance but rather harm it. As does his insistence that the murder of Lebanon’s former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri eight years ago was done with a ‘secret missile’ fired from the Zionist regime occupying Palestine. There are a fair number of “Resistance groupies” and bloggers, well-meaning perhaps, but who in many cases actually aid enemies of the Resistance through their clumsy attempts at water carrying while ignoring reality.</p>
<p>But there is good news awaiting Mr. Amin if he will accept an invitation from one who considers himself to have been “Hezbollah” long before the 1985 “Open Letter” announcing the organizing of the Party of God next to where this observer gets his motorbike repaired in Ouzai. That is to say “Hezbollah” in the sense that since studying international law in law school this observer has supported the liberation of Palestine while rejecting the last of the 19th century’s colonial enterprise still occupying Palestine, and in the sense that this observer shares Hezbollah’s resistance goals and their declared responsibility to continue the struggle until achieving the full Right of Return. Oh yes, to be sure, this observer is not a card-carrying member of the Resistance, as I want to remind dear friend Jeff Feltman, who swore at an embassy Christmas party a while back that “Lamb faces ten years hard time in the feds when he dares to set foot on American soil for hobnobbing with terrorists”—though given the fact that Jeff had been imbibing some Christmas cheer when he made that statement to an embassy staffer, he has perhaps forgotten it now, which would be good news.</p>
<p>But at any rate, for Mr. Amin, here is what a fellow supporter of the Resistance is willing to do to possibly help him re-assess his conclusion about what is going on in Yarmouk: I invite Mr. Amin to appear in the lobby of the Dama Rose hotel in Damascus at 9 a.m. sharp on January 24. I will buy him breakfast, and as we dine, two contacts from Yarmouk will brief him on our morning program—a program that will include Mr. Amin discretely accompanying us to the south side of Yarmouk, where, depending on conditions that morning, we will arrive in front of the Zakerin Mosque in Al-Buweida, maybe 300 yards from the Az-Zain neighborhood. Mr. Amin will then need to join us crawling through a rather claustrophobic and smelly 30” diameter drain pipe that is approximately 40 yards in length. We will at this point hopefully end up safely in the basement of “Abu Ali’s” remaining half-house, where several refugees are still trapped. Mr. Amin can also visit with others next door. He should bring some cash, however, because his host doesn’t have much and we may need a bit to bribe a couple of gun-kids from one of the militias to facilitate our exit in case we are ratted out, so to speak.</p>
<p>Finally Mr. Amin will be able to see for himself, and listen to direct testimony, about what presently is, and has been, happening inside Yarmouk. He can ask the weakened residents about the conclusions he confidently presented in his Al Akbar article in which he claimed that the Yarmouk tragedy and crimes are their fault, or, as he so confidently put it, “Today, the unfolding events (in Yarmouk) are 100 percent a Palestinian responsibility.” He may be surprised at what he learns about camp residents still trapped there, people scrabbling to feed themselves, and who have had no say or active role in the deplorable events that have overtaken them.</p>
<p>Just maybe, then, Mr. Amin will be motivated to edit a bit his earlier ridiculous broadside attacking the victims of the Yarmouk siege. And should he feel any contrition, maybe he will devote some of his energy and space in his newspaper to actually working for two elementary civil rights for Palestinians in Lebanon—the right to work and home ownership. Their achievement will benefit Lebanon and the Resistance, both of which Mr. Amin claims to support.</p>

<p>The globalists put their plan into motion decades ago. The proper meaning of the headline is not that China is an economic miracle, but that the United States, systematically stripped of its industrial might, is destined to fall even further. The Chinese economy is a haven of direct transnational integration. The outsourcing of manufacturing from domestic capacity is not solely a response of cheaper economic cost of goods production. No, the underlying reason for the migration of product assemblage is to weaken an independent American economy.</p>
<p>The news of this long awaited milestone, primarily announced in the foreign press, almost has a ring of glee. The Guardian reports that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/10/china-surpasses-us-world-largest-trading-nation">China surpasses US as world&#8217;s largest trading nation</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;China’s annual trade in goods passed the $4tn (£2.4tn) mark for the first time last year according to official data, after exports from the world&#8217;s second largest economy rose 7.9% to $2.21tn and imports rose 7.3% to $1.95tn.</p>
<p>As a result total trade rose 7.6% over the year to $4.16tn. The US is yet to publish its 2013 trade figures, but with trade totaling $3.5tn in the first 11 months of the year, it is unlikely to beat China.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Further coverage presented in the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10565166/China-overtakes-US-to-become-worlds-biggest-goods-trading-nation.html">Telegraph</a>, the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7c2dbd70-79a6-11e3-b381-00144feabdc0.html">Financial Times</a> and the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25678415">BBC</a>, reflects I told you so attitude.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s always been a matter of time until China surpasses the US &#8230; and there are good reasons to believe that China is likely to retain this pole position for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trade figures look very healthy and the factors underpinning them are structurally sustainable. It is hard to see them being reversed significantly, at least in the short to medium term.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Contrast this viewpoint with the assessment out of <a href="http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2014/01/10/china-were-now-the-biggest-trading-nation-in-the-world/">Marketwatch</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;And let’s not forget: The economic data out of Chinese agencies has long been seen as a bit questionable. Even the country’s own statistics office has said it is trying to clean up the inaccuracies. As our own <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/china-exports-trade-surplus-miss-forecasts-2014-01-09-221034612">Michael Kitchen points out</a>, trade data has come under particular suspicion, as businesses disguise some money flows as trade to try to bypass controls.&#8221;Of course, the U.S. press continues to make excuses that conceal the betrayal of American trade policy goals and practices. These are the same business journalists that repeat the statistical figures coming out of recent administrations that need revisions, when caught in dramatic errors of omission or deception.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Proponents of a structured destruction of America’s economy, laud international trade, as long as it slanted to eliminate domestic survival and reduces our standard of living. This lunacy, stated in <a href="http://www.economywatch.com/international-trade/benefit.html">Benefits of International Trade</a>, does not square with the aftermath of a trade deficit that has become a permanent fixture.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some important benefits of International Trade</p>
<ul>
<li> Enhances the domestic competitiveness</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Takes advantage of international trade technology</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Increases sales and profits</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Extend sales potential of the existing products</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Maintain cost competitiveness in your domestic market</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Enhance potential for expansion of your business</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Gains a global market share</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Reduce dependence on existing markets</li>
<li> Stabilize seasonal market fluctuations</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Now examine the real significance of this &#8220;Free Trade&#8221; globalist plan for America.</p>
<blockquote><p>1. How can domestic competitiveness improve, when entire industries move offshore?</p>
<p>2. Where is the advantage in developing new technology domestically and transferring it to foreign plants, even if owned by &#8220;so called&#8221; U.S. national companies?</p>
<p>3. Increase sales and profits, booked by foreign subsidiaries, means that the capital is not repatriated back.</p>
<p>4. If products produced domestically, shipped, and sold to overseas markets, there would be a valid benefit. However, the direction is in reverse.</p>
<p>5. Maintaining cost competitiveness translates into closing domestic facilities.</p>
<p>6. Expansion of business means look overseas because domestic consumers have less money to spend.</p>
<p>7. Oh yes, the holy grail of market share, means last company standing, since domestic markets have reduced sales.</p>
<p>8. Yep, now that existing domestic markets are sinking, move your boat to a different ocean.</p>
<p>9. Seasonal fluctuations means that booms are past profit spikes, the new normal is a perpetual dip.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chinese perspective as reported in <a href="http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2014-01/04/content_17215275.htm">China Daily</a> from Wang Haifeng, a researcher with the Institute for International Economic Research at the National Development and Reform Commission, needs especial emphasis.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The size of the value of the trade in goods tells just one side of the story. The other side is that China&#8217;s export competitiveness, as well as the competitiveness of its trade structure, is far behind the US. The competitive advantage of US exports centers on its technology, quality and brands, with added-value being very significant. China&#8217;s export prices are much cheaper on average and a large part of its exports are from OEMs (original equipment manufacturers),&#8221; Wang said.</p></blockquote>
<p>When an economic system intentionally transfers their technological advantages, inventions and intellectual edge to a foreign country so that companies can avoid domestic taxation or onerous regulation, the future adverse and inevitable consequences with such relocations, are preordained.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://rt.com/business/china-us-largest-trading-country-908/">World Bank data</a>, in 2011, the US GDP reached $15 trillion while China totaled $7.3 trillion. Just how long will it take this gap to narrow and surpass the U.S. GDP?</p>
<p>If a comparison of gambling revenue is a leading indicator, just look at <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303640604579295884261629874">Chinese Territory Broaden Lead as Global Casino Capital</a>. &#8220;It now takes Macau&#8217;s gamblers just one day to wager what&#8217;s bet in an entire week on the Las Vegas Strip.&#8221; To make thing even worse, <a href="http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/24418581/nevadas-biggest-casinos-lose-13b-in-2013#axzz2qEphGEse">Nevada&#8217;s biggest casinos lose $1.35B in 2013</a>.<br />
This example demonstrates the extravagant cash flow and disposable income that is circulating in China. Much of this opulence comes from the pocketbooks of struggling Americans, who buy essential or sustainable goods that have a made in China label.</p>
<p>Tech firms transfer the secrets of their products and software to their Chinese partners as the U.S. government subsidized consumer or the remnant middle class, just deepen this destructive cycle. This absurd economic bargain drives the wealth disparity to irrational levels. That is exactly the objective of the globalists, and the rest of us are mere spectators as the Chinese laugh at our stupidity.</p>

</div>
<p>A few years back, at the end of 2009, I was approached on two separate occasions by people claiming to be “representatives” of a digital alternative currency format. I was, of course, intrigued by the initial proposal, being that I had been writing for some time on the concept of non-participation as a way to insulate average Americans from the dangers of our unstable fiat driven mainstream economy. Before that, I had already dealt with just about every currency alternative one could imagine; from paper scripts backed by goods, to scripts backed by time or labor, to gold and silver laden currency cards, etc, etc. All of them had the advantage of NOT relying on private Federal Reserve notes, and all of them had flaws as well. The proposed digital script, which the representatives called “Bitcoin”, was no different.</p>
<p>The idea was to recruit my website as a promoter for bitcoin, but I had many questions before I would stick my neck out on a brand new high-tech anti-currency, and most of these question were not answered in any satisfactory manner.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of “solutions” in Liberty Movement circles, but many of these solutions require that we work within the system according to establishment rules (which they can change at any given moment). They assume that the system will abide by some kind of internal code, that our candidates will be treated fairly, that elections will not be rigged, that a better methodology or technology will be acknowledged and eventually adopted, that the “majority” of the public will someday see the light and back our cause, that the elite will not simply decide to put a bullet in our head.</p>
<p>The reality is, if a solution is dependent on a paradigm controlled by the corrupt system you are trying to change, it is no solution at all. Because of this, my focus has always been on methods that separate Americans from reliance on the system as much as possible.</p>
<p>When first confronted with bitcoin activism, I recognized almost immediately that this was NOT a method that operated outside the system, even though it tried very hard to appear that way. It was high-tech, it was sexy (admittedly far sexier in its presentation than gold and silver), and it catered to the egos of the digital generation, the loudest voices in media today. This thing was certainly marketable. However, just because something is highly marketable does not make it a good idea, or a meaningful alternative.</p>
<p><strong>The Tantalizing Allure Of Non-Solutions</strong></p>
<p>When a person invests a sizable amount of capital into an idea, not to mention a sizable amount of philosophical faith, they tend to lose a measure of objectivity. This is not just a struggle for proponents of bitcoin but for proponents of ALL methodologies. I do believe that many bitcoin promoters have the best of intentions, and that they are seeking some way to break from what they understand is a corrupt financial structure. That said, there is an escalating streak of elitism within the bitcoin culture, and I have witnessed on numerous occasions the kind of anger and immediate dismissal the average statist would spew when they are confronted with criticism. If you dare to question the greater details behind Bitcoin, be prepared to be accused of anything from “conspiracy theory”, to “jealousy” for missing the boat on bitcoin profits, to “ignorance” of the genius of cryptography.</p>
<p>What I came to realize through my questions to bitcoin followers was that many of them were not actually involved in the deeper aspects of the Liberty Movement, constitutional activism, sound money, self defense, and so on. Almost none of them had a preparedness plan, few of them had experience with precious metals, none of them owned firearms, and none of them had any inclination towards the building of local networks for mutual aid. Worst of all, many of them had no understanding of the wider threat of economic collapse that America faces today. In fact, when the possibility of full spectrum collapse is brought up, many Bitcoiners actually respond with the same brand of shallow dismissals that one would expect from the Paul Krugman&#8217;s and Ben Bernanke&#8217;s of the world.</p>
<p>This reaction is not necessarily shocking. Most people imagine themselves accomplishing heroic feats, and why not? It is one of the more noble and beautiful traits of mankind. For the crypto-engineers of the new century and the digital generation overall, heroics have felt unattainable. Elections are finally being recognized as the sham they represent, while protest activism has fallen flat on its face. The concept of peaceful redress of grievances has been met with rather frightening displays of state violence and censorship to which a physical response for the common protestor is unthinkable. The signs and slogan chants may have inspired the education of some, but in the meantime, they have accomplished very little in terms of political or social change. The bottom line is that the establishment LOVES non-aggression protests – they have no plan, few concrete goals, and present no overt threat to the elite.</p>
<p>The system only grows more despotic, more invasive, and more dangerous. Anti-establishment champions have been searching for something that goes beyond mere “education”, or clamoring like caged monkeys for media attention. They want to storm the castle, they want to fight back, but they haven&#8217;t the slightest clue how. They desire an intellectual method of combat, something with far less fear, far less risk, and far less pain. Enter Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Bitcoin gives the digital generation the chance to feel heroic where they never could before. They don&#8217;t have to face the machine head on. They don&#8217;t have to fight. They don&#8217;t have to suffer. They don&#8217;t have to die. All they have to do is utilize some cryptographic wizardry within the supposedly anonymous safety of the web, buy bitcoins en masse, and the system would crumble at their feet, rebuilt in the name of free markets by the electronic commons and without a shot fired. Again, very sexy&#8230;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the real world does not necessarily lend itself to the demands of the digital. The digital world is at the mercy of physical. The real world is rarely sexy; often it is ugly, brutal, hypocritical, illogical, and psychotic. The real world, at times, can break, and when it does the digital will break with it. The digital world is in large part a fantasy supported by the whims of the real. Which leads me to the core failings of the bitcoin adventure&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin Theater</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all heard praises lavished on bitcoin, not only from the web activists but from the mainstream media itself. Establishment controlled outlets like Reuters and Bloomberg have an astonishing number of bitcoin stories per week, and most of these stories paint the crypto-currency in a positive light. We&#8217;ve heard about bitcoin&#8217;s “unbreakable” cryptography. Its finite supply. The inability to duplicate the currency from thin air. Its rising acceptance in the corporate world. The Cinderella stories of bitcoin investors buying Lamborghinis and New York brownstones. Even Ben Bernanke seems to have a soft spot for bitcoin:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ben-bernanke-on-bitcoin-2013-11">http://www.businessinsider.com/ben-bernanke-on-bitcoin-2013-11</a></p>
<p>But is bitcoin&#8217;s rise really all it&#8217;s cracked up to be? Here are just a few of the problems which lead me to believe the digital currency is ultimately a clever distraction.</p>
<p><strong>Who really started Bitcoin?</strong></p>
<p>One of my first questions to bitcoin representatives back in 2009 was WHO, exactly, founded the operation? Well, Satoshi Nakamodo, everyone knows that, right? But who the hell is Satoshi Nakamodo? Who is the original designer of bitcoin? Who holds the foundational key to the structure of bitcoin&#8217;s cryptography? Is Nakamodo a person, or a group? Why should we trust him, or them, to safeguard our wealth any more than the Federal Reserve? The fact is no one except maybe Gavin Andresen, the chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, knows who is behind the digital currency. We actually know more about the banking elites behind the Fed than we do about the founders of bitcoin.</p>
<p>The common response to this concern is to suggest that it doesn&#8217;t really matter, bitcoin is secure, it is open source, it is cryptography&#8217;s holy grail, the creators are protecting their identities against retribution from the establishment, and the excuses go on&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, but this attitude constitutes an act of blind faith in a currency mechanism, which is exactly what proponents of the dollar are guilty of. If an activist individual or group is going to offer a solution to the movement, then they had better be willing to take the risk of being personally available to the movement. If you don&#8217;t have the balls to show your face to help legitimize your idea, I can&#8217;t take your idea seriously. Maybe I&#8217;m just old fashioned&#8230;</p>
<p>For all we know, bitcoin is a creation of the establishment, not a creation countering the establishment.  After all, the globalists WANT the destruction of the dollar &#8211; why not let the public destroy the dollar using a mechanism that ultimately does not represent a threat to the greater bankster cartel?</p>
<p><strong>The Media Love Affair With Bitcoin</strong></p>
<p>During the first and second Ron Paul campaigns, the mainstream media made a blatant and obvious effort to purposely ignore the candidate, his arguments, and his successes. Coverage was next to nil. His expansive crowds of supporters were edited out of news footage. His high polling numbers were censored. If not for the independent media, you wouldn&#8217;t have known the guy existed. When someone or something presents a legitimate threat to the establishment, the establishment&#8217;s first tactic is to make sure no one knows.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, has received a steady flow of positive media attention, with the random critical piece thrown in for good measure. Overall, the establishment has embraced, if not directly fueled, the bitcoin trend. This is rather surprising to me considering the “destroyer of the dollar” has only been around for four years.</p>
<p>When an anti-establishment vehicle suddenly becomes the center focus of establishment affections, and when globalist monsters like Ben Bernanke throw flower petals in its path, I have to wonder if Bitcoin is a real threat, or just a ruse.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoins Can Indeed Be Confiscated</strong></p>
<p>Some of the early hype surrounding Bitcoin claimed that the currency could not be confiscated, making it “better than gold” (the better than gold motto has been widely espoused by Gavin Andresen). This claim turned out to be false when the FBI became the holder of the world&#8217;s LARGEST Bitcoin wallet:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/12/fbi_wallet/">http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/12/fbi_wallet/</a></p>
<p>I find arguments that this is only a temporary condition and that the feds will eventually auction off their holdings a bit laughable, but indicative of the denial inherent in Bitcoin culture.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin Values Can Be Manipulated</strong></p>
<p>Another claim heard was the assertion that bitcoins cannot be created out of thin air, they must be “mined” using powerful computers, which removes centralized manipulation of value. This may be true in certain respects (for now), but anything digital can be exploited in one way or another.</p>
<p>Bitcoin malware, for instance, hijacks the computers of unwitting people and uses them to artificially “mine” the currency.</p>
<p><a href="http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/us/webattack/93/Cybercriminals%2BUnleash%2BBitcoinMining%2BMalware">http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/us/webattack/93/Cybercriminals%2BUnleash%2BBitcoinMining%2BMalware</a></p>
<p>The bitcoins mined are then transferred into the hands of anonymous hackers. This represents a serious threat to the stability of bitcoin because it creates an invasive form of attack speculation. Bitcoins can be removed from the market and deliberately hoarded. Hackers, or governments could conceivably kill bitcoin by mining a large portion of them out of circulation, artificially hyperinflating the value of the remaining coins (like a speculator would do with commodities), or dumping a large portion and abruptly cutting the value. Major bitcoin hoarders could use their massive bitcoin stakes to shift values at will. As long a Bitcoin operates on supply and demand, it can be threatened through speculation like ay other commodity (if you consider digitized numbers floating around the web a commodity).</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin Is Not Private</strong></p>
<p>While bitcoins can apparently be stolen or criminally mined by anonymous persons or organizations, honest users are subject to considerable scrutiny. A disturbing aspect of bitcoin is the group surveillance that goes into tracing transactions, otherwise known as the “proof of work system”. The bitcoin network is constantly dependent on decoders who track and verify bitcoin trades in order to ensure that the same bitcoins are not used during multiple trades or purchases. Anyone with the desire could decode the transaction history of the network, or “block chain”, including governments. Though Bitcoiners are considered “partially anonymous”, tracking the individual identity of a bitcoin trade is not difficult for entities such as the NSA because every transaction leaves a digital trail..</p>
<p>The use of anonymising browsers like Tor also have not produced the kind of privacy that was promised when bitcoin was introduced.</p>
<p>This is exactly the kind of currency system global bankers have sought for some time &#8211; total information awareness of all financial transactions and purchases within the system. While bitcoin proponents claim that their currency is a revolution against centralized oversight of monetary transactions, the truth is they have built the perfect centralized surveillance solution. Paper dollar purchases are difficult to trace. Gold, silver, and barter purchases are nearly impossible to track. Bitcoin, though, is the most traceable form of currency on the planet, and this is basically REQUIRED by the network itself. The entire trade history of every bitcoin is recorded. The digital landscape is the ultimate form of privacy invasion, especially for the likes of super computer wielding agencies like the NSA. Bitcoin aids the development of this intrusive system.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin Relies On The Continued Survival Of The Open Web</strong></p>
<p>Yes, bitcoins can be stored on physical wallet devices, but the majority portion of bitcoin trading and bitcoin mining requires the continued operation of the web. The internet is NOT a creative commons, as many believe. It is in fact a controlled networking system that we have simply been allowed to use. The exposure by Edward Snowden of NSA activities has proven once and for all that nothing you do on the web is private. Everything is tracked and recorded. Period.</p>
<p>Web access can also be easily denied by governments, and power centers around the globe have been utilizing this option more and more. During a national crisis, whether real or engineered, the continued function of the internet as we know it is not guaranteed. A currency relying on a government dominated internet is not truly independent. A grid down situation would also make bitcoin stores virtually useless.</p>
<p><strong>The Suspicious Nature Of Bitcoin</strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin is consistently touted as a superior option to precious metals as a way to decouple from central bank fiat. Under examination, though, it appears to me that bitcoin is instead a deliberate distraction away from gold and silver, and other tangible solutions; in other words, I believe it to be a form of controlled opposition.</p>
<p>A vital aspect of physical gold and silver investment is not only to break from the dollar, but to also remove physical metal from the system and starve international banks that issue millions of fraudulent unbacked paper certificates. The strategy, which I still stand by, is for the public to absorb as much of the precious metals market as possible until manipulators like JP Morgan finally have to admit that they don&#8217;t have the coins and bars to back all the fake ETF&#8217;s they have been issuing investors for years. In the process, we decouple from the dollar AND do damage to the banking cartel itself. The bitcoin fad, in my opinion, is designed to lure the public away from overtaking the metals market while banks and foreign governments vacuum up remaining physical in preparation for a dollar collapse.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s market value is not only extremely volatile, the currency is also subject to replacement at any time. Anyone with an interest can create a cryptocurrency. There is nothing particularly special about the bitcoin design, and if someone offered a digital currency tomorrow that was truly anonymous, it could quickly supplant bitcoin. Though its cryptography makes it difficult to artificially inflate (again, for now), other digital currencies can still be produced out of thin air. Bitcoiners desperately want to equate cryptography with tangibility, but the truth is that there is no comparison. Physical gold and silver cannot be artificially produced by anyone, anywhere. Digital currencies can be produced at will and hyped like Dutch tulip mania.</p>
<p>The most unsettling aspect of bitcoin, however, is not its distraction away from precious metals. Rather, it is the distraction away from localized solutions. Bitcoin proponents may be searching for decentralization, but they seem to have forgotten the most most important part of the process – localism. The trade of digital mechanisms over impersonal web networks and online marketplaces is not conducive to local economic stability or sustainability. Bitcoin does not encourage people to build local markets, to adopt useful trade skills, to prepare for a grid down scenario, or circulate wealth within one&#8217;s community. Bitcoin only furthers the removal of independence and self sustainability from local economies by fooling activists into thinking that buying things without dollars is enough.</p>
<p>If Americans in particular want to pursue any solution to the threat of globalism or dollar collapse, they are going to have to start with themselves, and the community around them. Online trade is the last thing they should be worried about. Only when neighborhoods, towns, and counties become producers and self suppliers will they be safe from financial instability. Only when those same communities band together for mutual aid and self defense will they be safe from tyrannical political entities. Bitcoin accomplishes nothing in either of these categories, making it possibly the most popular non-solution for liberty to date.</p>

			<p><em>It is the responsibility of intellectuals to speak the Truth and expose lies.</em> — Noam Chomsky.</p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/enemyofthestate3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>My book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1610162528?tag=lewrockwell"><em>The Wizards of Ozymandias</em></a>, was dedicated <em>“To the memory and spirit of Sophie and Hans Scholl and the White Rose, who reminded us what it means to be civilized.”</em> These wonderful young people — most in their teens or twenties — lived in Germany during the Hitler regime, and spent much of their time writing and distributing leaflets exposing and criticizing the policies and practices of the Nazi state. They were found out; brought to trial; found guilty of treason, the demoralization of the troops, and abetting the enemy, and summarily beheaded. Sophie’s Gestapo interrogator raises the same arguments one hears directed against such modern speakers of truth as Chelsea Manning, Ed Snowden, Julian Assange, Glenn Greenwald, and others. Those whose moral and intellectual standards can rise no higher than to whine “the law is the law,” would do well to consider the exchange between Sophie and her prosecutor. The Nazi functionary declares: <em>“Without law, there is no order. What can we rely on if not the law?”</em> Sophie responds: <em>“Your conscience. Laws change. Conscience doesn’t.”</em></p>
<p>Our Western culture is in a state of total collapse. Our institutionalized world is increasingly hostile to any utterances of truth that would be upsetting to the status quo. The mainstream media and most of academia long ago gave themselves over to propagandizing on behalf of defending and/or enhancing the coercive power structure of the state. When war policies are under discussion, retired Army generals or officials from “think-tanks” funded by the national defense industry, are trotted out to “debate” such non-issues as how many troops to send in, who to attack, etc., etc., all to maintain the pretense of having a “fully-informed” public. But when was the last time you saw a Robert Higgs, Noam Chomsky, Lew Rockwell, Amy Goodman, Justin Raimondo, Angela Keaton, Karen Kwiatkowski, Chris Hedges, or other critic of the war system allowed to raise the kinds of questions that are not supposed to be asked in this best of all possible worlds? Do you recall the insult to human intelligence perpetrated by the GOP (Grand Old Pettifoggers) in its efforts to prevent Ron Paul from expressing his contrary views?</p>
<p>Noam Chomsky’s above quote doesn’t go far enough: it is the responsibility of <em>all </em>thinking people — not just so-called “intellectuals” — to speak the truth and to expose lies! To this end, increasing numbers of people understand that the sources to whom they have been conditioned to look for truth, analysis, and understanding, have largely failed in their roles. To put the proposition more frankly: more and more people have grasped the fact that the free flow of information is disruptive of the interests of the institutional order, whose established position depends upon suppressing or destroying all evidence of the lies, conflicts, contradictions, and destructive nature upon which its primacy depends. This is why so much of the media and academia are peopled with those unable or unwilling to shed light on the dysfunctional nature of the well-ordered madness of the world; men and women who remain content to tread water at the shallow end of the human gene pool!</p>
<p>The political establishment has implicitly embraced the mindset of Hitler’s Propaganda Minister, Dr. Joseph Goebbels:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension the truth becomes the greatest enemy of the State.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This is why the state is so threatened by such modern technologies as the Internet, as well as by the “whistleblowers” who insist on exposing the state’s embarrassing truths to the general public. It is also why the classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1491076933?tag=lewrockwell"><em>The Emperor’s New Clothes </em></a>needs to be read to every child — as well, perhaps, to adults.</p>
<p>Cable news channels continue providing platforms for those who remind us that the whistleblowers “broke the law,” and need to be punished. They recite their bromides with the kind of self-assurance that comes from the delusion that they are actually saying something profound. I find it particularly amusing to hear such babbling coming from lawyers who ought to know that <em>all </em>laws are meant to be broken. Imagine what would happen if every legal dictate were to be obeyed by everyone: no speeding or reckless driving; no illegal drug use; no murders, rapes, or robberies; no discriminatory hiring practices; no zoning violations; etc. What would be the likely consequences? Men and women might then begin to ask the kinds of questions the state could not afford to have asked: why do we need the police, or courts, or prisons? In the world of realpolitik, those who are driven <em>not </em>by a need for social order, but by the ambition for coercive power over their neighbors, would have to dream up new “wrongs” to be policed. The mania that underlies political programs based on “climate change” is just one example of how those who want power over others must invent more and more “conflicts” with which to rationalize their coercive ambitions. It is this sense that Edmund Burke had in mind when he characterized lawyers as “the fomenters and conductors of the petty wars of village vexation.” The habit is not confined to lawyers!</p>
<p>This also explains Randolph Bourne’s observation that “war is the health of the state.” The war system — whose schemes and chicanery the whistleblowers have been exposing — depends upon the kinds of endless conflicts with the rest of the world that will cause Boobus Americanus to part with his liberty, wealth, and life.</p>
<p>Sophie and Hans Scholl and their White Rose friends had minds capable of distinguishing what was <em>legal </em>and what was <em>right</em>, a skill that depends upon separating what is <em>popular </em>from what is <em>true. </em>Sophie’s insights were reflected, years later, in Hannah Arendt’s observation: “The aim of totalitarian education has never been to instill convictions, but to destroy the capacity to form any.”</p>

<p>It was the winter of 1939, only a few months earlier the Soviet Union and Hitler&#8217;s Third Reich had signed a partially secret accord known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact; essentially a non-aggression treaty which divided Europe down the middle between the fascists and the communists. Hitler would take the West, and Stalin would take the East. Stalin&#8217;s war machine had already steamrolled into Latvia. Lithuania, and Estonia. The soviets used unprecedented social and political purges, rigged elections, and genocide, while the rest of the world was distracted by the Nazi blitzkrieg in Poland. In the midst of this mechanized power grab was the relatively tiny nation of Finland, which had been apportioned to the communists.</p>
<p>Apologists for Stalinist history (propagandists) have attempted to argue that the subsequent attack on Finland was merely about “border territories” which the communists claimed were stolen by the Finns when they seceded from Russia during the Bolshevik Revolution. The assertion that the soviets were not seeking total dominance of the Finns is a common one. However, given the vicious criminal behavior of Russia in nearby pacified regions, and their posture towards Finland, it is safe to assume their intentions were similar. The Finns knew what they had to look forward to if they fell victim to the iron hand of Stalin, and the soviet propensity for subjugation was already legendary.</p>
<p>The Russian military was vastly superior to Finland&#8217;s in every way a common tactician would deem important. They had far greater numbers, far better logistical capability, far better technology, etc, etc. Over 1 million troops, thousands of planes, thousands of tanks, versus Finland&#8217;s 32 antiquated tanks, 114 planes which were virtually useless against more modern weapons, and 340,000 men, most of whom were reservists rallied from surrounding farmlands. Finland had little to no logistical support from the West until the conflict was almost over, though FDR would later pay lip service to the event, “condemning” soviet actions while brokering deals with them behind the scenes. Russian military leadership boasted that the Finns would run at the sound of harsh words, let alone gun fire. The invasion would be a cakewalk.</p>
<p>The battle that followed would later be known as the “Winter War”; an unmitigated embarrassment for the Soviets, and a perfect example of a small but courageous indigenous guerrilla army repelling a technologically advanced foe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To Fight, Or Pretend To Fight?</strong></p>
<p>Fast forward about seven decades or so, and you will discover multiple countries around the globe, including the U.S., on the verge of the same centralized and collectivized socialist occupation that the Finnish faced in 1939. The only difference is that while their invasion came from without, our invasion arose from within. The specific methods may have changed, but the underlying face of tyranny remains the same.</p>
<p>In America, the only existing organization of people with the slightest chance of disrupting and defeating the march towards totalitarianism is what we often refer to as the “Liberty Movement”; a large collection of activist and survival groups tied together by the inexorable principles of freedom, natural law, and constitutionalism. The size of this movement is difficult to gauge, but its social and political presence is now too large to be ignored. We are prevalent enough to present a threat, and prevalent enough to be attacked, and that is all that matters. That said, though we are beginning to understand the truly vital nature of our role in America&#8217;s path, and find solidarity in the inherent values of liberty that support our core, when it comes to solutions to the dilemma of globalization and elitism, we are sharply divided.</p>
<p>While most activist movements suffer from a complete lack of solutions to the problems they claim to recognize, constitutional conservatives tend to have TOO MANY conceptual solutions to the ailments of the world. Many of these solutions rely upon unrealistic assumptions and methods that avoid certain inevitable outcomes. Such strategies center mostly on the concepts of “non-aggression” or pacifism idealized and romanticized by proponents of Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr, and the anti-war movements of the 1960&#8242;s and 1970&#8242;s. The post-baby boomer generations in particular have grown up with an incessant bombardment of the “higher nature” of non-violence as a cure-all for every conceivable cultural ailment.</p>
<p>We have been taught since childhood that fighting solves nothing, but is this really true?</p>
<p>I can understand the allure of the philosophy. After all, physical confrontation is mentally and emotionally terrifying to anyone who is not used to experiencing it. The average “reasonable” person goes far out of their way on every occasion to avoid it. Most of the activists that I have met personally who deride the use of force against tyrannical government have never actually been in an outright confrontation of any kind in their lives, or if they have, it ended in a failure that scarred them. They have never trained for the eventuality. Many of them have never owned a firearm. The focus of their existence has been to hide from pain, rather than overcome their fears to achieve something greater.</p>
<p>There is nothing necessarily wrong with becoming an “intellectual warrior”, unless that person lives under the fantasy that this alone will be enough to defeat the kind of evil we face today.</p>
<p>Non-aggression methods rely on very specific circumstances in order to be effective. Most of all, they rely on a system of government that is forced to at least PRETEND as if it cares what the masses think of it. Gandhi&#8217;s Indian Independence Movement, for example, only witnessed noticeable success because the British government at that time was required to present a semblance of dignity and rule of law. But what happens if a particular tyranny reaches a point where the facade of benevolence disappears? What happens when the establishment turns to the use of the purge as a tool for consolidation? What happens when the mask comes completely off?</p>
<p>How many logical arguments or digital stashes of ethereal Bitcoins will it take to save one&#8217;s life or one&#8217;s freedom then?</p>
<p><strong>Arguments For And Against Violent Action</strong></p>
<p>The position against the use of “violence” (or self defense) to obstruct corrupt systems depends on three basic debate points:</p>
<p><em><strong>1) Violence only feeds the system and makes it stronger.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>2) We need a “majority” movement in order to be successful.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>3) The system is too technologically powerful – to fight it through force of arms is “futile”, and our chances are slim to none.</strong></em></p>
<p>First, violence does indeed feed the system, if it is driven by mindless retribution rather than strategic self defense. This is why despotic governments often resort to false flag events; the engineering of terrorist actions blamed on scapegoats creates fear within the unaware portions of the population, which generates public support for further erosion of freedoms. However, there is such a thing as diminishing returns when it comes to the “reach, teach, and inspire” method.</p>
<p>The escalation of totalitarianism will eventually overtake the speed at which the movement can awaken the masses, if it has not done so already. There will come a time, probably sooner rather than later, when outreach will no longer be effective, and self defense will have to take precedence, even if that means subsections of the public will be shocked and disturbed by it. The sad fact is, the faster we wake people up, the faster the establishment will degrade social stability and destroy constitutional liberties. A physical fight is inevitable exactly because they MAKE it inevitable. Worrying about staying in the good graces of the general populace or getting honest representatives elected is, at a certain point, meaningless. I find it rather foolish to presume that Americans over the next decade or two or three have the time needed to somehow inoculate the system from within. In fact, I&#8217;m starting to doubt that strategy has any merit whatsoever.</p>
<p>Second, the idea that a movement needs a “majority” of public backing to shift the path of a society is an old wives tale. Ultimately, most people throughout history are nothing more than spectators in life, watching from the sidelines while smaller, ideologically dedicated groups battle for superiority. Global developments are decided by true believers; never by ineffectual gawkers. Some of these groups are honorable, and some of them are not so honorable. Almost all of them have been in the minority, yet they wield the power to change the destiny of the whole of the nation because most people do not participate in their own futures. They merely place their heads between their legs and wait for the storm to pass.</p>
<p>All revolutions begin in the minds and hearts of so-called “outsiders”. To expect any different is to deny the past, and to assume that a majority is needed to achieve change is to deny reality.</p>
<p>Third, I&#8217;m not sure why non-aggression champions see the argument of statistical chance as relevant. When all is said and done, the “odds” of success in any fight against oligarchy DO NOT MATTER. Either you fight, or you are enslaved. The question of victory is an afterthought.</p>
<p>Technological advantage, superior numbers, advanced training, all of these things pale in comparison to force of will, as the Finnish proved during the Winter War. Some battles during that conflict consisted of less than a hundred Finns versus tens-of-thousands of soviets. Yet, at the end of the war, the Russians lost 3500 tanks, 500 aircraft, and had sustained over 125,000 dead (official numbers). The Finns lost 25,000 men. For every dead Finn, the soviets lost at least five. This is the cold hard reality behind guerrilla and attrition warfare, and such tactics are not to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Do we go to the Finnish and tell them that standing against a larger, more well armed foe is “futile”? Do we tell them that their knives and bolt action rifles are no match for tanks and fighter planes? And by extension, do we go to East Asia today and tell the Taliban that their 30 year old AK-47&#8242;s are no match for predator drones and cruise missiles? Obviously, victory in war is not as simple as having the biggest gun and only the uneducated believe otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>The Virtues Of Violence</strong></p>
<p>The word “violence” comes with numerous negative connotations. I believe this is due to the fact that in most cases violence is used by the worst of men to get what they want from the weak. Meeting violence with violence, though, is often the only way to stop such abuses from continuing.</p>
<p>At Alt-Market, we tend to discuss measures of non-participation (not non-aggression) because all resistance requires self-sustainability. Americans cannot fight the criminal establishment if they rely on the criminal establishment. Independence is more about providing one&#8217;s own necessities than it is about pulling a trigger. But, we have no illusions about what it will take to keep the independence that we build. This is where many conceptual solutions are severely lacking.</p>
<p>If the system refuses to let you walk away, what do you do? If the tyrants would rather make the public suffer than admit that your social or economic methodology is better for all, how do you remove them? When faced with a cabal of psychopaths with deluded aspirations of godhood, what amount of reason will convince them to step down from their thrones?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry to say, but these questions are only answered with violence.</p>
<p>The Liberty Movement doesn&#8217;t need to agree on the “usefulness” of physical action because it is coming regardless. The only things left to discern are when and how. Make no mistake, one day each and every one of us will be faced with a choice – to fight, or to throw our hands in the air and pray they don&#8217;t shoot us anyway. I certainly can&#8217;t speak for the rest of the movement, but in my opinion only those who truly believe in liberty will stand with rifle in hand when that time comes. A freedom fighter is measured by how much of himself he is willing to sacrifice, and how much of his humanity he holds onto in the process. Fear, death, discomfort; none of this matters. There is no conundrum. There is no uncertainty. There are only the chains of self-defeat, or the determination of the gun. The sooner we all embrace this simple fact, the sooner we can move on and deal with the dark problem before us.</p>

<p>In 33 years of forecasting trends, the Trends Research Institute has never seen a new year that will witness severe economic hardship and social unrest on one hand, and deep philosophic enlightenment and personal enrichment on the other. A series of dynamic socioeconomic and transformative geopolitical trend points are aligning in 2014 to ring in the worst and best of times.</p>
<p>Ready or not, here they come.</p>
<p><strong>March Economic Madness:</strong> One of the most difficult aspects of trend forecasting is getting the timing right. And when it comes to economics, there are many wildcards that can stall or detour any on-rushing trend. We called the Crash of ’87, the 1997 Asian Currency Crisis and the Panic of ’08 (we even established the domain name in 2007) right on the button. But we missed the mark with our Crash of 2010 prediction.</p>
<p>Why? The Federal Reserve and central banks around the world were secretly pumping tens of trillions of dollars into a failing financial system. These were, at the time, unimagined schemes for nations that pride themselves on capitalism. And while we are not naïve to the dirty dealings of the financial industry, rigging the daily multi-trillion dollar LIBOR and FOREX markets was not on our radar. Thus, what we believed to be economic truths and hard facts were, in fact, cover-ups and lies….</p>
<p>Such unforeseeable factors aside, we forecast that around March, or by the end of the second quarter of 2014, an economic shock wave will rattle the world equity markets. What will cause this econo-shock? How can you prepare for it? It’s a Top Trend of 2014. Read about it in the Winter Trends Journal.</p>
<p><strong>Global Chinatowns:</strong> Name the continent or pick a country, every one contains its own brand of Chinatown. The Chinese global buying binge, now in its early growth stage, will noticeably accelerate in 2014. From coal mines in Zambia, to Borscht Belt resorts in New York, to factories in Italy, and to farmlands in Ukraine, a seemingly endless variety of Chinese development projects are being incubated around the world. If there is a deal to be had and a need to be filled, Chinese players are increasingly at the front of the line.</p>
<p>Wealthy investors, college graduates without jobs, skilled and unskilled laborers will be migrating out of their overpopulated, congested and highly polluted nation to foreign shores. Where are the new growth areas? What actions will be taken to stop or control the trend? Who will benefit? Who will lose? And what are the dangers and opportunities? You’ll find the answers in the Winter Trends Journal.</p>
<p><strong>Wake Up Call:</strong> Last year we forecast the Great Awakening 2.0, a period reminiscent of the first Great Awakening that provided the intellectual, philosophical and spiritual ammunition that ignited the American Revolution. The “Awakening” has begun. Throughout 2014, and beyond, you will hear the Wake Up Call. It will be loud and distinct.</p>
<p>In 2013, the White House and Congress proved their extreme incompetence with a series of public failures. From closing down the government, to the debt ceiling debacle, to the aborted attack on Syria and, ultimately, to the disastrous launch of Obamacare, the ineptness of our political leaders was overwhelming. As polls show, a majority of citizens registered levels of scorn and ridicule unparalleled in modern America.</p>
<p>But this phenomenon is not limited to America. Around the world, citizen distrust has turned into universal disdain for entrenched political parties whose draconian austerity measures and punishing economic policies have thrown millions into poverty and pushed millions of protesters into the streets. Civil wars, civil unrest, revolts and revolutions will be just some of the cards dealt by an angry public that has lost everything and has nothing left to lose.</p>
<p>Will those in power hear the Wake Up Call? Or will they attempt to stamp it down and drown it out? Hear it or not, the movement is unstoppable. It will be a battle of the classes. What will it mean? Where will it take the biggest toll? Can the protests and disturbances of tomorrow bring peace and enlightenment that will lead to the Great Awakening 2.0? It’s all in the Top Trends 2014 Winter Trends Journal.</p>
<p><strong>Seniors Own Social Media:</strong> Seniors now comprise the fastest-growing user segment of the social media world, and the year ahead will see the retail, business, political, health and entertainment industries evolve aggressive strategies to realize the robust economic potential in engaging seniors.</p>
<p>The gamut of possibilities is so grand that we forecast technological and product advances that impact everything from nursing home life to political campaigns and causes. Read the Winter Trends Journal to pinpoint how this trend will unfold and affect you and your interests.</p>
<p><strong>Populism: </strong>Regardless of how professional politicians deride it or how the traditional media describe it, “populism” is a megatrend sweeping Europe, and it will soon spread across the globe. Mired in prolonged recession, disgusted with corrupt political parties, and forced to follow EU, ECB and IMF austerity dictates, populist movements are seeking to regain national identity and break free from the euro and Brussels domination. These movements are positioned to bring down ruling parties and build up new ones.</p>
<p>The discontent of the one-size-fits-all Euro Union formula is so deep that populists are expected to gain some 25 percent of the European Parliament seats in next year’s elections. “We have the big risk to have the most ‘anti-European’ European Parliament ever,” cried Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta. “The rise of populism is today the main European social and political issue,” Mr. Letta added. “To fight against populism, in my view, is a mission today – in Italy and in the other countries.”</p>
<p>Already, some nations, such as Spain, have passed new laws restricting public demonstrations while imposing police-state measures to stamp out dissent. What is the future of populism? How far will it spread? Will it lead to the formation of new parties, or lead to civil wars? Read about it in the Trends Journal’s Top Trends 2014 edition.</p>
<p><strong>Trouble in Slavelandia:</strong> Even as total US personal wealth soars above a record high of $77 trillion, fueled by the stock market’s own record highs, life for the growing number of have-nots in Slavelandia has become more desperate. In today’s Plantation Economy – driven by the bottom line needs of multinationals and flailing austerity-prone governments – low-paying service jobs and reduced hours engineered to evade corporate responsibility to provide benefits, are making it tough for the working poor, a group that now includes debt-burdened and underemployed college graduates and seniors as well as the traditional underclass.</p>
<p>Nearly half of the requests for emergency assistance to stave off hunger or homelessness comes from people with full-time jobs. As government safety nets are pulled out from under them – as they will continue to be for the foreseeable future – the citizens of Slavelandia will have no recourse but action. The fast-food worker strikes of 2013, seeking a higher minimum wage, were just a mild taste of what is to come. Learn more in the WinterTrends Journal.</p>
<p><strong>The New Altruism:</strong> Several burgeoning trends identified for 2014 will coalesce in a welcome trend toward selfless concern for the wellbeing of others and an interest in the common good. Across the age divide, from people in their youth to those of advanced years, the search for meaning will intensify and become more widespread in response to waning resources, want, and an over-commodified culture. As despair quietly takes more prisoners, Doing Good will be recognized as the key to escape.</p>
<p>Ironically, the Internet that has been much maligned for currying narcissism will make the donation of money, time and talents so easy that people will be able to enact their better natures without resistance. Be they Boomers in renaissance or populists in revolt, people will discover and expand the humanist side of globalism and act accordingly. See why in the Top Trends of 2014 Winter edition of the Trends Journal.</p>
<p><strong>Private Health Goes Public:</strong> While the world focused on the blockbuster NSA surveillance revelations and other cyber-snooping episodes of 2013, another powerful trend line was firmly planted: Your health data has been progressively mined, assembled and made accessible to a widening group of interested parties.</p>
<p>While signing up for the Affordable Care Act brought some attention to this developing trend, around the globe, data on individuals’ health status, behaviors, prescriptions and even their genetic indicators have been funneled to a wide range of databases. Those databases have many purposes and a growing number of hands on them.</p>
<p>The positive and negative implications of this trend are equally powerful. Individuals and their health care providers can more easily tie vital physical data with worldwide medical databases to anticipate and potentially prevent disease. But, in the wrong hands, the data can be used to exploit, damage and take advantage of individuals and their families. Security concerns will rise in equal importance with the potential benefits of this critical trend line.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you, your family, or your business? The Winter Trends Journal will provide the answers.</p>
<p><strong>Boomer Renaissance Arrives:</strong> Distinct and strengthening economic, lifestyle and societal determinants are building a creative foundation for the older population as it discovers new approaches to work and finds long-elusive contentment in the process.</p>
<p>You already know that older workers, seeing their retirement plans shattered, have to work beyond traditional retirement years. You also know that those same economic dynamics are forcing aging Boomers to entirely rethink retirement. And, of course, you know that as Boomers are living longer, traditional thinking about retirement has been stood on its head. What you might not realize is how these factors are compelling Boomers to unearth potent creative energies not only to survive, but to realize potential that evaded them in traditional work roles.</p>
<p>In 2014, we will see growing evidence of this Boomer Renaissance, accentuated by waves of self-guided entrepreneurism that alchemizes commerce, survival and self-actualization into a new world and self view. The Winter Trends Journal will explore this compelling 2014 trend in depth.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Learning Explodes:</strong> Fears that online educational platforms fall short of providing depth and effectiveness in the learning experience will all but disappear. Across the entire educational spectrum, online learning will expand to include not only course instruction, but also a wealth of real-life learning experience, with considerable participation by the skills-hungry business community.</p>
<p>For individuals, educational institutions, industries, small businesses and up-and-coming entrepreneurs, the implications are enormous. From traditional degree-based education to very specific micro skills-based learning, this trend line explodes. The Trends Research Institute will break down the implications for individuals, business professionals and a range of industries in its Winter Trends Journal.</p>

<p>A top financial advisor, worried that Obamacare, the NSA spying scandal and spiraling national debt is increasing the chances for a fiscal and social disaster, is recommending that Americans prepare a “bug-out bag” that includes food, a gun and ammo to help them stay alive.</p>
<p>David John Marotta, a Wall Street expert and financial advisor and Forbes contributor, said in a note to investors, “Firearms are the last item on the list, but they are on the list. There are some terrible people in this world. And you are safer when your trusted neighbors have firearms.”</p>
<p>His memo is part of a series addressing the potential for a “financial apocalypse.” His view, however, is that the problems plaguing the country won’t result in armageddon. “There is the possibility of a precipitous decline, although a long and drawn out malaise is much more likely,” said the Charlottesville, Va.-based president of Marotta Wealth Management.</p>
<p>Marotta said that many clients fear an end-of-the-world scenario. He doesn’t agree with that outcome, but does with much of what has people worried.</p>
<p>“I, along with many other economists, agree with many of the concerns expressed in these dire warnings. The growing debt and deficit spending is a tax on those holding dollars. The devaluation in the U.S. dollar risks the dollar’s status as the reserve currency of the world. Obamacare was the worst legislation in the past 75 years. Socialism is on the rise and the NSA really is abrogating vast portions of the Constitution. I don’t disagree with their concerns,” he wrote.</p>
<p>In his latest note, he said that Americans should have a survival kit to take in case of a financial or natural disaster. It should be filled with items that will help them stay alive for the first 72-hours of a crisis, including firearms.</p>
<p>“A bug-out bag is a good idea depending on where you live even if the emergency is just power outages, earthquakes and hurricanes. And with your preparedness you will be equipped to help others who might be in need,” he wrote. “Be prepared. Especially because it keeps you from being scared.”</p>
<p>He provided a list of items and even a link to bug-out bags on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ready-America-70280-Grab-n-Go-Emergency/dp/B000FJQQVI/ref=sr_1_3?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388077463&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=bug+out+bag" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.</p>

<p><em></em><em><strong>&#8220;The powers of financial capitalism had (a) far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences. The apex of the systems was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland; a private bank owned and controlled by the world&#8217;s central banks which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank&#8230; sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world.&#8221;</strong></em><em> - Carroll Quigley, member of the Council on Foreign Relations</em></p>
<p>If one wishes to truly understand the actions behind private Federal Reserve policy, one must come to terms with a fundamental reality – everything the Fed does it does for a reason, and the most apparent reasons are not always the primary reasons. If you think that the Fed simply acts on impulsive stupidity or hubris, then you haven&#8217;t a clue what is going on. If you think the Fed only does what it does in order to hide the numerous negative aspects of our current economy, then you only know half the story. If you think the Fed does not have a plan, then you are sorely mistaken&#8230;</p>
<p>Central Bankers and their political proponents espouse a globalist ideology, meaning, they are internationalists in their orientation and motivations. They do not have loyalties to any particular country. They do not take an oath to any particular constitution. They do not have empathy for any particular culture or social experiment. They have their own subculture, with their own “values”, and their own social hierarchy. They are a kind of “tribe” or “sect”; a cult,if you will, that views itself as superior to all others. This means that when the central bankers that run the Fed act, they only act with the intention to support and promote globalization, not the best interests of America and Americans.</p>
<p>The process of globalization REQUIRES the dissolution of the U.S. economy as it exists today. Period. There is no way around it. America can no longer remain a superpower in the face of what globalists call “harmonization”. The dollar can no longer maintain its petro-currency status or its world reserve status if total centralization under a new global currency is to be achieved. Globalists believe that America must be sacrificed on the altar of “progress”, and diminished into a mere enclave, a feudal colony of a greater global system. The globalists at the Fed are no different.</p>
<p>Once this driving philosophy is understood, the final conclusion is obvious – the Fed exists to destroy the U.S. financial system and the U.S. currency mechanism. That is what they are here for.</p>
<p>This is why the dollar has lost 98% of its value since the Fed was established in 1913. This is why the Fed deliberately engineered the derivatives bubble crisis through the implementation of artificially low interest rates. This is why their response to the crisis was to create yet another massive bubble in stocks and bonds through QE stimulus. This is why the Fed is cutting stimulus today.</p>
<p>How does the taper play into the long running program of dollar destruction and globalization? Let&#8217;s take a look&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>The Multifaceted Taper Strategy</strong></p>
<p>In my article <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/1721-is-the-fed-ready-to-cut-americas-fiat-life-support">&#8216;Is The Fed Ready To Cut America&#8217;s Fiat Life Support&#8217;</a>, and my article <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/1837-expect-devastating-global-economic-changes-in-2014">&#8216;Expect Devastating Global Economic Changes In 2014&#8242;</a>, I predicted that a Fed taper was highly likely. Central banks almost always implant policy shift rumors into the mainstream media a few months before they implement them. They did this for TARP, for QE1, QE2, QE3, and the Taper. In fact, the Fed spent the better part of the past quarter conditioning investors to the idea of stimulus cuts, so I was not at all surprised when they followed through.</p>
<p>The Fed has, of course, now announced a $10 billion QE reduction just in time for Christmas and the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the privately run institution. In the past, I have pointed out the tendency of central banks to enforce detrimental policy changes while the government, the economy and/or the bank itself is in the midst of a major transition. The Fed&#8217;s taper announcement comes just in time for the end of Ben Bernanke&#8217;s term as chairman, and the expected nomination of Janet Yellen.</p>
<p>This is done, I believe, because it provides an opportunity to divert blame for a crisis event they know is on the horizon. If attention is ever focused on the Fed specifically for a market downturn or bond disaster triggered by the ever present dollar bubble, Yellen can simply blame the QE policies of Bernanke (who will be long gone), while promising that her “new” policies will surely repair the damage. This placates the public and buys the central bankers time to do even MORE damage.</p>
<p>The taper itself is not just a “head fake”, however. It is a far more complex action. Tapering provides a method of psychologically distancing the Federal Reserve from the consequences of market movements. The banksters are essentially proclaiming to the public that their work is done, they have saved the economy, and now they are moving on, be it only $10 billion at a time. Whatever happens from here on is “not their fault”.</p>
<p>Most alternative analysts expected no taper of QE, and for good reason. While the mainstream touts the propaganda of economic recovery, independent financial experts understand that little to nothing was actually accomplished by the bailouts. Virtually no stimulus was absorbed in a localized way by mainstreet business. Real unemployment counting U-6 measurements still stands at around 20%. Real estate markets and home prices have a received a small boost, which at first glance appears positive until one examines who is actually buying; namely big banks and international investment firms snapping up properties only to reissue them on the market as rentals:</p>
<p><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/behind-the-rise-in-house-prices-wall-street-buyers/?_r=0">http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/behind-the-rise-in-house-prices-wall-street-buyers/?_r=0</a></p>
<p>U.S. holiday retail sales and annual retail sales have been the weakest since 2009:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-30/black-friday-traffic-seen-thinning-as-stores-open-early.html">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-30/black-friday-traffic-seen-thinning-as-stores-open-early.html</a></p>
<p>The only thing that QE ultimately accomplished was a spectacular rise in stocks through direct manipulation, which Fed agents like Alan Greenspan and Richard Fisher now openly admit to. The problem is, while gamblers in equities proudly boast about the Fed induced bull run in the Dow and how much money they have made, they remain oblivious to the underlying cost of the charade. Market investors have been enriched, yes, but little do they know that stock legitimacy is about to be sacrificed.</p>
<p>The price to earnings ratio of stocks (the market value of stocks versus what they SHOULD be valued according to the actual earnings of the companies listed) in the S&amp;P 500 today stands at around 15, which is the highest it has been since before the 2008 market crash. Mainstream economists attempt to dismiss the issue by using a 15 year average while claiming that the P/E ratio in 2013 is mild compared to the tech bubble of the late 90&#8242;s. What they don&#8217;t seem to grasp is that the market of the past four to five years is an entirely different animal compared to 15 years ago.</p>
<p>Stocks in general have received considerable support through purchases by Fed bolstered banks and the Fed itself, creating an atmosphere of artificial demand for equities using QE fiat injections. Though no full audit of the bailouts exists (TARP is the only measure audited so far), it is projected that the banking sector alone has garnered tens of trillions in Fed fiat, which they have used to bolster their otherwise debt ridden holdings. It is only logical to expect that this capital tsunami has been used by numerous companies as a way to present false earnings.<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/01/wall-street-bailout-executive-compensation">Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Morgan Stanley all reported substantial profits for 2009</a> while at the same time reporting massive liabilities caused by the derivatives crash so that they could collect on the bailout bonanza.</p>
<p>So which one is it? Are companies making profits, or are they wallowing in insurmountable debt while presenting government stimulus as a form of profit?</p>
<p>What the Fed and corporate banks have done is create a market in which neither earnings, nor stock values can be trusted. The fact that the P/E ratio is higher than it has been since 2008 despite this manipulation should concern anyone with any sense.</p>
<p>Worst of all, the Fed&#8217;s monetization of U.S. Treasury debt has only expanded while foreign investment in long term debt has contracted. With our official national debt growing by at least $1 trillion per year, our country cannot continue to function without an ever increasing amount of foreign investment, or, Federal Reserve printing. The Fed cannot make cuts to QE if our system is to survive (if you want to call it survival), the Fed must expand QE forever, or at least until the dollar implodes due to hyperinflation.</p>
<p>So then, why has the taper been introduced at all? No one wants it. The government shouldn&#8217;t want it. Investors certainly don&#8217;t want it. Our economy is utterly dependent on the opposite. What purpose does it serve?</p>
<p>The assumption has always been that the Fed wants to keep the system afloat. I submit that things have changed. I submit that the Fed no longer wishes to prop up our fiscal structure, or at least, no longer wishes to be seen as propping it up. I submit that the Fed is not pursuing dollar destruction through standard hyperinflation, but rather, they are preparing the U.S. for default, which also will result in currency implosion.</p>
<p><strong>The Taper Parallels</strong><em><strong></strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;It must not be felt that the heads of the world&#8217;s chief central banks were themselves substantive powers in world finance. They were not. Rather they were the technicians and agents of the dominant investment bankers of their own countries, who had raised them up, and who were perfectly capable of throwing them down. The substantive financial powers of the world were in the hands of these investment bankers who remained largely behind the scenes in their own unincorporated private banks. These formed a system of international cooperation and national dominance which was more private, more powerful, and more secret than that of their agents in the central banks. &#8220;</strong> - Carroll Quigley, Tragedy And Hope</em></p>
<p>Initial shock over the taper scenario has not sunk into the markets yet (<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-12-18/what-happened-last-time-major-central-bank-tapered-qe">as Zero Hedge points out</a>, the last time a major central bank cut stimulus measures to a dependent country, stocks rallied, then crashed within months). Few people see much difference between $75 billion per month and $85 billion per month, but the size of the cuts is not really the issue. Rather, it is the Fed&#8217;s act of fading into the background that should concern us.</p>
<p>The taper announcement parallels perfectly with the accelerating debate over the U.S. debt ceiling, and I do not think this is at all a coincidence. Tapering seems inconceivable to many, but for the Fed it makes perfect sense if the goal of the globalists is to generate a default scenario while diverting blame. I believe that Americans are being prepared psychologically for just such an event. Already, the White House is warning that government funding will essentially disappear by the end of February:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/19/us-usa-fiscal-idUSBRE9BF1FW20131219">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/19/us-usa-fiscal-idUSBRE9BF1FW20131219</a></p>
<p>The expectation fostered by the mainstream media is that a debt fight similar to the October theater will not happen again. I agree. I believe the next debate will be much worse. The vast majority will assume that the “can” will be kicked down the road again, and they may be right, but given the Fed&#8217;s behavior, and given that they have begun to taper despite what appears logical, many people may be in for a shock when our government also suddenly decides one day soon to buck assumptions and default rather than prolong the pain.</p>
<p>The full spectrum failure of Obamacare only adds excuse and incentive. There is no longer a legislative centerpiece rationale for further spending. Obama&#8217;s approval rating is at historic lows for any president. The stage has been set for the most epic of fake political battles.</p>
<p>The Left and Right leadership, at the top of the pyramid, are nothing more than flunkies for the global elite. If globalists have decided that it is time to apply the final death blows to the dollar, default would be the quickest and most efficient way, and political puppetry can easily make it happen. The calamity would be blamed on “partisan bickering” and “government gridlock”, or even the inefficiency of “democracy”. The Fed, with its taper in place and its fake recovery established, would be presented as the only “sane” institution at America&#8217;s disposal.</p>
<p>Perhaps at this point even more pervasive QE programs would recommence, perhaps not. At bottom, though, the taper is not a peripheral issue. It is an action at the center of a much more elaborate process, an action that seems to have been undertaken in preparation for a larger event. The next year is shaping up to be the most chaotic since the debt crisis began in 2008, and as the situation progresses, the subtleties of the Federal Reserve and the international banks that back it must not go unnoticed, or in the end, unpunished.</p>

</div>
<p>Practiced for thousands of years by cultures around the world &#8211;detoxification is about resting, cleansing and nourishing the body from the inside out. By removing and eliminating toxins, then feeding your body with healthy nutrients, detoxifying can help protect you from disease and renew your ability to maintain optimum health. These foods will assist in boosting your metabolism, optimizing digestion, while allowing you to lose weight and fortify your immune system.</p>
<div>
1. ARTICHOKES<br />
<img alt="" src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/artichoke-d1_small.jpg" width="264" height="189" longdesc="http://veracityvoice.com/images/artichoke-d1_small.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Artichokes help the liver function at its best, which in turn will help your body purge itself of toxins and other things it doesn’t need to survive. It ups the liver’s production of bile, and since bile helps break down foods which helps your body use the nutrients inside them, an increase in bile production is typically a good thing.</p>
<div>
2. APPLES<br />
<img alt="" src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/apple-d1_small.jpg" width="264" height="189" longdesc="http://veracityvoice.com/images/apple-d1_small.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Apples are full of wonderful nutrients. You get fibre, vitamins, minerals and many beneficial phytochemicals such as D-Glucarate, flavonoids and terpenoids. All of these substances are used in the detox process. One flavonoid, Phlorizidin (phlorizin), is thought to help stimulate bile production which helps with detox as the liver gets rid of some toxins through the bile. Apples are also a good source of the soluble fibre pectin, which can help detox metals and food additives from your body. It&#8217;s best to eat only <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/09/042809_organic.shtml" target="_blank">organic apples</a> as the non-organic varieties are among the top 12 foods that have been found to contain the most pesticide residues. Organically produced apples also have a <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/09/042809_organic.shtml" target="_blank">15 percent higher antioxidant capacity</a> than conventionally produced apples.</p>
<div>
3. ALMONDS<br />
<img alt="" src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/almonds-d1_small.jpg" width="264" height="189" longdesc="http://veracityvoice.com/images/almonds-d1_small.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Almonds are the best nut source of Vitamin E. In fact, just one ounce contains 7.3 mg of &#8220;<a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/13/031513_Foods-Highest-In-Vitamin-E-Prevent-Cancer-Not-Supplements.shtml" target="_blank">alpha-tocopherol</a>&#8221; vitamin E, the form of the vitamin the body prefers. They&#8217;re also high in fiber, calcium, magnesium, and useable protein that helps stabilize blood sugar and remove impurities from the bowels.</p>
<div>
4. ASPARAGUS<br />
<img alt="" src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/asparagus-d1_small.jpg" width="264" height="189" longdesc="http://veracityvoice.com/images/asparagus-d1_small.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Not only does asparagus help to detoxify the body, it can help you wage the anti-aging battle, protect you from getting cancer, help your heart to stay healthy, and is a general anti-inflammatory food. It’s also known to help with liver drainage, which might sound like a bad thing, but since the liver is responsible for filtering out the toxic materials in the food and drinks we consume, anything that backs up its drainage is not doing you any favors. Asparagus also helps <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/12/070912_Eating-These-Foods-Lowers-Death-From-Breast-Cancer.shtml" target="_blank">reduce risk of death from breast cancer</a> and increase the odds of survival.</p>
<div>
5. AVOCADOS<br />
<img alt="" src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/avocado-d1_small.jpg" width="264" height="189" longdesc="http://veracityvoice.com/images/avocado-d1_small.jpg" />
</div>
<p>This wonder fruit is packed with antioxidants, lowers cholesterol and dilates the blood vessels while blocking artery-destroying toxicity. Avocados contain a nutrient called glutathione, which blocks at least 30 different carcinogens while helping the liver detoxify synthetic chemicals. Researchers at the University of Michigan found that elderly people who had high levels of glutathione were healthier and less likely to suffer from arthritis. <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/13/022213_Amazing-News-For-People-Who-Consume-Avocados.shtml" target="_blank">Consuming avocados is associated with better diet quality and nutrient intake level</a>, lower intake of added sugars, lower body weight, BMI and waist circumferences, higher “good cholesterol” levels and lower metabolic syndrome risk.</p>
<div>
6. BASIL<br />
<img alt="" src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/basil-d1_small.jpg" width="264" height="189" longdesc="http://veracityvoice.com/images/basil-d1_small.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Basil has anti-bacterial properties, and it’s full of antioxidants to protect the liver. The active ingredients are terpenoids. It is also wonderful for digestion and detoxification, too. It supports the functioning of the kidneys and also acts as a diuretic to help the body expel unwanted toxins. Basil has been known to have <a href="http://www.zhion.com/herb/Basil.html">anti-ulcer</a> qualities as well as antimicrobial effects that guard against bacteria, yeast, fungi and mold. Basil seed can also help with constipation. The <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/13/062713_17-Spices-Scientifically-Proven-To-Prevent-and-Treat-Cancer.shtml" target="_blank">anticancer properties of basil</a> may also relate to its ability to influence viral infections.</p>
<div>
7. BEETS<br />
<img alt="" src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/beets-d1_small.jpg" width="264" height="189" longdesc="http://veracityvoice.com/images/beets-d1_small.jpg" />
</div>
<p>A single serving of beets can do more for your health than most foods in the produce isle. Not only can they <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/13/031113_This-Root-Prevents-Cancer-Lowers-Blood-Pressure-Boosts-Your-Brain-And-Your-Sex-Life.shtml" target="_blank">boost your energy and lower your blood pressure</a>, but eating beets in the long-term can help you fight cancer, reduce arthritic pain, boost your brain as well as help you lose weight. Beets contain a unique mixture of natural plant chemicals (phytochemicals) and minerals that make them superb fighters of infection, blood purifiers, and liver cleansers. They also help boost the body’s cellular intake of oxygen, making beets excellent overall body cleansers. When you’re detoxing, beets will help by making sure that the toxins you’re getting out actually make it out of your body. Many detox cleanses go wrong when toxins are reintroduced to the body because they don’t make it all the way out.</p>
<div>
8. BLUEBERRIES<br />
<img alt="" src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/blueberries-d1_small.jpg" width="264" height="189" longdesc="http://veracityvoice.com/images/blueberries-d1_small.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Blueberries contain natural aspirin that helps lessen the tissue-damaging effects of chronic inflammation, while lessening pain. Just <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/13/022013_Just-300-Grams-of-Blueberries-Protects-Against-DNA-Damage-In-Humans.shtml" target="_blank">300 grams of blueberries protects against DNA damage</a>. Blueberries also act as antibiotics by blocking bacteria in the urinary tract, thereby helping to prevent infections. They have antiviral properties and are loaded with super-detoxifying phytonutrients called proanthocyanidins.</p>
<div>
9. BRAZIL NUTS<br />
<img alt="" src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/brazilnuts-d1_small.jpg" width="264" height="189" longdesc="http://veracityvoice.com/images/brazilnuts-d1_small.jpg" />
</div>
<p>These tasty treats are packed with selenium, which is key to flushing mercury out of your body. The body uses selenium to make ‘selenoproteins’, which work like antioxidants preventing damage to cells and there is growing body of evidence to show it has a key role in our health. The consumption of brazil nuts has been found to be <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/13/112113_Large-Scale-Study-Shows-Nuts-Decrease-Cancer-Risk-More-Than-One-Thirds.shtml" target="_blank">inversely associated with risk of pancreatic cancer</a>, independent of other potential risk factors for pancreatic cancer.</p>
<div>
10. BROCCOLI<br />
<img alt="" src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/broccoli_-d1_small.jpg" width="264" height="189" longdesc="http://veracityvoice.com/images/broccoli_-d1_small.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Broccoli specifically works with the enzymes in your liver to turn toxins into something your body can eliminate easily. If you’re stuck for ways on how to make broccoli taste better try dehydrating or consider eating it raw. But don’t microwave it as this destroys both the nutritional and detox potential. Broccoli contains a <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/13/082913_Broccoli-Based-Medicine-Against-Cancer-Osteoporosis-and-Cardiovascular-Protection.shtml" target="_blank">very powerful anti-cancer, anti-diabetic and anti-microbial called sulforaphane</a> which helps prevent cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis and allergies.</p>
<div>
11. BROCCOLI SPROUTS<br />
<img alt="" src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/broccoli_sprouts-d1_small.jpg" width="264" height="189" longdesc="http://veracityvoice.com/images/broccoli_sprouts-d1_small.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Broccoli sprouts can actually provide more benefit than regular broccoli as they contain 20 times more sulfurophane. They contain important phytochemicals that are released when they&#8217;re chopped, chewed, fermented, or digested. The substances are released then break down into sulfurophanes, indole-3-carbinol and D-glucarate, which all have a specific effect on detoxification. Add these to your salads and get creative with them in your meals. Researchers have found that an oral preparation made from <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/09/031209_broccoli.shtml" target="_blank">broccoli sprouts trigger an increase in inflammation-fighting enzymes</a> in the upper airways.</p>
<div>
12. CABBAGE<br />
<img alt="" src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/cabbage_-d1_small.jpg" width="264" height="189" longdesc="http://veracityvoice.com/images/cabbage_-d1_small.jpg" />
</div>
<p>In addition to cleansing your liver, cabbage will also aid in helping you go to the bathroom, which in turn helps you expel the toxins, getting them out of your system so you can start fresh. It contains sulfur, which is essential when it comes to breaking down chemicals and removing them from your body. Along with other cole crops, cabbage is a source of<a title="Indole-3-carbinol" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indole-3-carbinol" target="_blank">indole-3-carbinol</a>, a chemical that boosts DNA repair in cells and appears to <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/12/111512_Eating-Purple-Cabbage-Is-Great-For-Your-Skin-And-Prevents-Cancer.shtml" target="_blank">block the growth of cancer cells</a>.</p>
<div>
13. CILANTRO<br />
<img alt="" src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/cilantro_-d1_small.jpg" width="264" height="189" longdesc="http://veracityvoice.com/images/cilantro_-d1_small.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Cilantro, also known as coriander, Chinese parsley or dhania, contains an<a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/12/090612_Cilantro-A-Powerhouse-of-Minerals-and-Vitamins.shtml" target="_blank">abundance of antioxidants</a>. Cilantro helps mobilize mercury and other metals out of the tissue so it can attach to it other compounds and allow it to be excreted from the body. It also contains an antibacterial compound called dodecenal, which laboratory tests showed is twice as effective as the commonly used antibiotic drug gentamicin at killing Salmonella.</p>
<div>
14. CINNAMON<br />
<img alt="" src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/cinnamon_-d1_small.jpg" width="264" height="189" longdesc="http://veracityvoice.com/images/cinnamon_-d1_small.jpg" />
</div>
<p>The oils from cinnamon contain active components called cinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl acetate, and cinnamyl alcohol. Cinnamaldehyde has been well-researched for its effects on blood platelets helps prevent unwanted clumping of blood cells. Cinnamon&#8217;s essential oils also qualify it as an &#8220;anti-microbial&#8221; food, and cinnamon has been studied for its ability to help stop the growth of bacteria as well as fungi, including the commonly problematic yeast Candida. Cinnamon&#8217;s antimicrobial properties are so effective that recent research demonstrates this spice can be used as an alternative to traditional food preservatives. It has one of the <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/12/031212_Once-Valued-More-Precious-Than-Gold-Cinnamon-Is-The-Epitome-of-Natural-Medicine.shtml" target="_blank">highest antioxidant values of all foods</a> and its use in medicine treats everything from nausea to menstruation and energy to diabetes.</p>
<div>
15. CRANBERRIES<br />
<img alt="" src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/cranberries_-d1_small.jpg" width="264" height="189" longdesc="http://veracityvoice.com/images/cranberries_-d1_small.jpg" />
</div>
<p>While they are more popular as fruits that help prevent urinary tract infections, cranberries are antibacterial and are known to remove many different toxins from your body. Cranberries feature a rich profile of anti-inflammatory nutrients, provide immune and cardiovascular support, as well as promote digestive health. Consuming cranberry products has been<a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/13/071613_How-Do-Cranberries-Prevent-Infections.shtml" target="_blank">associated with prevention of urinary tract infections</a> (UTIs) for over 100 years.</p>
<div>
16. DANDELIONS<br />
<img alt="" src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/dandelions_-d1_small.jpg" width="264" height="189" longdesc="http://veracityvoice.com/images/dandelions_-d1_small.jpg" />

</div>
<p>Grapefruits can prevent weight gain, treat diabetes, lower cholesterol, fight cancer, heal stomach ulcers, reduce gum disease and even keep stroke and metabolic syndrome at bay. Grapefruits <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/12/051112_Grapefruits-Can-Treat-Disease-As-Well-As-Pharmaceuticals-Without-The-Side-Effects.shtml" target="_blank">can treat disease as well as pharmaceuticals without the side effects</a>. The rich pink and red colors of grapefruit are due to lycopene, a carotenoid phytonutrient. Among the common dietary carotenoids, lycopene has the highest capacity to help fight oxygen free radicals, which are compounds that can damage cells. The big takeaway on grapefruit is that it gets your liver fired up and ready for action, while infusing the rest of your organs with nutrient-laden fruit juice.</p>

</div>
<p>Some liver cleanses out there call for olive oil mixed with fruit juice in order to trigger your liver to expunge its gallstones. But aside from that olive oil should be your go-to oil when you’re trying to detox the body.

</div>
<p>This ubiquitous kitchen staple is as healthy as it is tasty. It’s brimming with sulfur-containing amino acids, which efficiently detox the liver. Raw onions deliver the most health benefits. Even a small amount of &#8220;overpeeling&#8221; can result in unwanted loss of flavonoids. For example, a red onion can lose about 20% of its quercetin and almost 75% of its anthocyanins if it is &#8220;overpeeled&#8221;. <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/12/121112_Onions-Soak-Up-Arsenic-Cadmium-Lead-Mercury-and-Tin-In-Contaminated-Foods.shtml" target="_blank">Onions will soak up arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury and tin in contaminated foods</a>. The total polyphenol content of onion is not only higher than its fellow allium vegetables, garlic and leeks, but also higher than tomatoes, carrots, and red bell pepper. Onions have been shown to inhibit the activity of macrophages, specialized white blood cells that play a key role in our body&#8217;s immune defense system, and one of their defense activities involves the triggering of large-scale inflammatory responses.</p>

They also relieve bloating during menstruation. The flavonoids in parsley&#8211;especially luteolin&#8211;have been shown to function as antioxidants that combine with highly reactive oxygen-containing molecules (called oxygen radicals) and help prevent oxygen-based damage to cells. In addition, extracts from parsley have been used in animal studies to help increase the antioxidant capacity of the blood.</p>

</div>
<p>Seaweed may be the most underrated vegetable in the Western world. Studies at McGill University in Montreal showed that seaweeds bind to radioactive waste in the body so it can be removed. Radioactive waste can find its way into the body through some medical tests or through food that has been grown where water or soil is contaminated. Seaweed also binds to heavy metals to help eliminate them from the body. In addition, it is a powerhouse of minerals and trace minerals. Seaweed extracts <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/12/060412_Seaweed-Extracts-Can-Help-You-Lose-Weight-Mostly-Body-Fat.shtml" target="_blank">can help you lose weight, mostly body fat</a>.</p>

<p>Sesame seeds&#8217; phytosterols have beneficial effects which are so dramatic that they have been extracted from many foods and added to processed foods, such as &#8220;butter&#8221;-replacement spreads, which are then touted as cholesterol-lowering &#8220;foods.&#8221; But why settle for an imitation &#8220;butter&#8221; when Mother Nature&#8217;s nuts and seeds are a naturally rich source of phytosterols&#8211;and cardio-protective fiber, minerals and healthy fats as well? Sesame seeds contain minerals important in a number of antiinflammatory and antioxidant enzyme systems. Sesame represents<a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/13/021913_The-Top-10-Healthiest-Seeds-on-Earth.shtml" target="_blank">one of the top 10 healthiest seeds on Earth</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>There is no remission to Washington’s belligerence towards Iran and no deal seems to be an antidote to this venom of spite secreted out on the part of the US officials on a daily basis.</p>
<p>In a tone not unfamiliar to Iranian ears, US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on board the USS Ponce, just 120 miles off the coast of Iran once again<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hagel-reminds-iran-that-threat-of-force-still-an-option/" target="_blank">reminded</a> the servicemen that the “threat of US military force still exists even though the Obama administration is pursuing a six-month long diplomatic process with Iran to freeze its nuclear program.”</p>
<p>There was some hope that the nuclear deal between Iran and the six world powers would considerably alleviate the tensions on Iran, relieve the inhumane sanctions against the Iranian population and offset future internal and external attempts directed at imposing more illegal sanctions against the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>However, the sanctions are not only still in place but there is also a perceptibly powerful force at work in Washington to intensify the sanctions that have already taken human toll in Iran.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/09/iran-usa-legislation-idUSL1N0JO1B320131209" target="_blank">reports</a>, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Robert Menendez, and Republican Senator Mark Kirk are on the verge of “agreeing on legislation that would target Iran’s remaining oil exports, foreign exchange reserves and strategic industries.”</p>
<p>Widely considered the major engineers of the anti-Iran sanctions, these two senators are at the beck and call of the Zionists and their efforts are certainly aimed at gratifying their Iranophobic desires.</p>
<p>Quite naturally, Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/09/us-iran-nuclear-zarif-idUSBRE9B810320131209" target="_blank">warned</a> Washington of imposing new sanctions as they would definitely kill the nuclear deal.</p>
<p>A top Republican Senate aide has told Reuters that the legislation is “an insurance policy to protect against Iranian deception.”</p>
<p>Time and again, Sen. Robert Menendez has proved to be cravenly submissive to Tel Aviv and has frequently warned Washington of the impending danger Iran poses towards the entity. For instance, in September, he recklessly <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/3/iran-hezbollah-could-possibly-strike-israel-sen-ro/" target="_blank">said</a> that Iran and Hezbollah “could possibly” strike Israel.</p>
<p>“The Iranians and Hezbollah… ultimately could possibly strike against neighbors in the region, including our ally, the state of Israel.”</p>
<p>Apart from playing an extremely effective role in imposing sanctions on Iran, he has resorted to any brute means to instill a sense of threat and phobia about Iran.</p>
<p>Also, in his AIPAC address, he clearly said that he would make every endeavor to <a href="http://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/-chairman-menendez-delivers-remarks-to-aipac-policy-conference" target="_blank">safeguard</a> the interests of Israel.</p>
<p>“The committee has helped every American president, from Harry Truman to Barack Obama, protect and defend our fundamental promise to stand with Israel and the Israeli people in a strong and lasting and enduring alliance. And as chairman, I can say without hesitation I will keep that promise as I always have. There will never be any daylight between the United States and Israel on my watch. Never. Not on my watch.”</p>
<p>Prominent among his numerous political hunger games are designing anti-Iran sanctions after sanctions under the aegis of Tel Aviv, authorizing the US President the use of military force in Afghanistan and his refusal to vote against the Iraq Resolution, which terminated in an invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>In this diabolical league comes in Sen. Mark Kirk, who tries in a similar way to disseminate fear of Iran in the world. During an invitation-only phone briefing for supporters, Kirk <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/11/21/exclusive_gop_senator_unloads_in_private_call/" target="_blank">said</a>, “It’s the reason why I ran for the Senate, [it] is all wrapped up in this battle. I am totally dedicated to the survival of the state of Israel in the 21st century. This has been very much a one-senator show, unfortunately.”</p>
<p>After all, Sen. Mark Kirk is a darling of the Zionists. In 2012, when he was still home recovering from a stroke that incapacitated him from making an appearance at AIPAC, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced his “sincere request” during his keynote and <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/pressroom/2012/pages/pm_netanyahu_aipac_policy_conference_5-mar-2012.aspx" target="_blank">said</a>, “I want to send a special message to a great friend of Israel who is not here tonight: Senator Mark Kirk, the co-author of the Kirk-Menendez Iran Sanctions Act. Senator Kirk, I know you’re watching this tonight. Please get well soon. America needs you; Israel needs you. I send you wishes for a speedy recovery. So get well and get back to work.”</p>
<p>Indeed it is not hard to imagine that these well-financed marionette-handlers in Washington are playing in the hands of Tel Aviv to advance their ultimate goals regarding Iran, which is clearly regime change. As time passes and realities come to surface, one acquires conviction that the rift that keeps deepening more and more between Iran and the West has nothing to do with a West concerned about Iran’s intention in trying to build a nuclear bomb; rather, it is an ulterior motive long cherished and shaped by the West and the Zionists: uprooting a tree of truth.</p>
<p>The confrontational attitude of these senators against Iran and the unfortunate and powerful sway they exercise on the powers-that-be in America leave no room for optimism in restructuring a politically correct attitude on the part of Washington towards Iran.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, global awakening is on the horizon. Manipulation of public opinion has run its course. Distorting the realities on the ground is a threadbare ploy. It is now generally acknowledged that the West’s narrative on Iran’s intention to produce nuclear weapons is but a thumping big lie and a fairy tale forcefully woven into the warps and wefts of public opinion. Indeed, it is, in Shakespeare’s words, “a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing.”</p>

<p>As a general rule, extreme economic decline is almost always followed by extreme international conflict. Sometimes, these disasters can be attributed to the human survival imperative and the desire to accumulate resources during crisis. But most often, war amid fiscal distress is usually a means for the political and financial elite to distract the masses away from their empty wallets and empty stomachs.</p>
<p>War galvanizes societies, usually under false pretenses. I’m not talking about superficial “police actions” or absurd crusades to “spread democracy” to Third World enclaves that don’t want it. No, I’m talking about REAL war: war that threatens the fabric of a culture, war that tumbles violently across people’s doorsteps. The reality of near-total annihilation is what oligarchs use to avoid blame for economic distress while molding nations and populations.</p>
<p>Because of the very predictable correlation between financial catastrophe and military conflagration, it makes quite a bit of sense for Americans today to be concerned. Never before in history has our country been so close to full-spectrum economic collapse, the kind that kills currencies and simultaneously plunges hundreds of millions of people into poverty. It is a collapse that has progressed thanks to the deliberate efforts of international financiers and central banks. It only follows that the mind-boggling scale of the situation would “require” a grand distraction to match.</p>
<p>It is difficult to predict what form this distraction will take and where it will begin, primarily because the elites have so many options. The Mideast is certainly an ever-looming possibility. Iran is a viable catalyst. Syria is not entirely off the table. Saudi Arabia and Israel are now essentially working together, forming a strange alliance that could promise considerable turmoil — even without the aid of the United States. Plenty of Americans still fear the Al Qaeda bogeyman, and a terrorist attack is not hard to fabricate. However, when I look at the shift of economic power and military deployment, the potential danger areas appear to be growing not only in the dry deserts of Syria and Iran, but also in the politically volatile waters of the East China Sea.</p>
<p>China is THE key to any outright implosion of the U.S. monetary system. Other countries, like Saudi Arabia, may play a part; but ultimately it will be China that deals the decisive blow against the dollar’s world reserve status. China’s dollar and Treasury bond holdings could be used as a weapon to trigger a global sell-off of dollar-denominated assets. China has stopped future increases of dollar forex holdings, and has cut the use of the dollar in bilateral trade agreements with multiple countries.  Oil-producing nations are shifting alliances to China because it is now the world’s largest consumer of petroleum. And, China has clearly been preparing for this eventuality for years. So, given these circumstances, how can the U.S. government conceive of confrontation with the East? Challenging one’s creditors to a duel does not usually end well. At the very least, it would be economic suicide. But perhaps that is the point. Perhaps America is meant to make this seemingly idiotic leap.</p>
<p>Here are just some of the signs of a buildup to conflict&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Currency Wars And Shooting Wars</strong></p>
<p>In March 2009, U.S. military and intelligence officials gathered to participate in a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-23/china-sabotages-dollar-defeats-u-s-in-alarming-financial-war-game-books.html" target="_blank">simulated war game</a>, a hypothetical economic struggle between the United States and China.</p>
<p>The conclusions of the war game were ominous. The participants determined that there was no way for the United States to win in an economic battle with China. The Chinese had a counterstrategy to every U.S. effort and an ace up their sleeve – namely, their U.S. dollar reserves, which they could use as a monetary neutron bomb, a chain reaction that would result in the abandonment of the dollar by exporters around the world . They also found that China has been quietly accumulating hard assets (including land and gold) across globe, using sovereign wealth funds, government-controlled front companies, and private equity funds to make the purchases. China could use these tangible assets as a hedge to protect against the eventual devaluation of its U.S. dollar and Treasury holdings, meaning the losses on its remaining U.S. financial investments was acceptable should it decide to crush the dollar.</p>
<p>The natural response of those skeptical of the war game and its findings is to claim that the American military would be the ultimate trump card and probable response to a Chinese economic threat. Of course, China’s relationship with Russia suggests a possible alliance against such an action and would definitely negate the use of nuclear weapons (unless the elites plan nuclear Armageddon). That said, it is highly likely that the U.S. government would respond with military action to a Chinese dollar dump, not unlike Germany’s rise to militarization and totalitarianism after the hyperinflationary implosion of the mark. The idea that anyone except the internationalists could “win” such a venture, though, is foolish.</p>
<p>I would suggest that this may actually be the plan of globalists in the United States and their counterparts in Asia and Europe. China’s rise to financial prominence is not due to its economic prowess. In fact, China is ripe with poor fiscal judgment calls and infrastructure projects that have gone nowhere. But what China does have on its side are massive capital inflows from global banks and corporations, mainly based in the United States and the European Union. And, it has help in the spread of its currency (the Yuan) from entities like JPMorgan Chase and Co. The International Monetary Fund is seeking to include China in its global basket currency, the SDR, which would give China even more leverage to use in breaking the dollar’s reserve status. Corporate financiers and central bankers have made it more than possible for China to kill the dollar, which they openly suggest is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBO34qcnoqM" target="_blank">“good thing.”</a></p>
<p>Is it possible that the war game scenarios carried out by the Pentagon and elitist think-tanks like the RAND Corporation were not meant to prevent a war with China, but to ensure one takes place?</p>
<p><strong>The Senkaku Islands</strong></p>
<p>Every terrible war has a trigger point, an event that history books later claim “started it all.” For the Spanish-American War, it was the bombing of the USS Maine. For World War I it was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. For U.S. involvement in World War I, it was the sinking of the Lusitania by a German U-Boat. For U.S. involvement in World War II, it was the attack on Pearl Harbor. For Vietnam, it was the Gulf of Tonkin Incident (I recommend readers look into the hidden history behind all of these events). While the initial outbreak of war always appears to be spontaneous, the reality is that most wars are planned far in advance.</p>
<p>As evidence indicates, China has been deliberately positioned to levy an economic blow against the United States. Our government is fully aware what the results of that attack will be, considering they have gamed the scenario multiple times. And, by RAND Corporation’s own admission, China and the United States have been preparing for physical confrontation for some time, centered on the concept of <a href="http://www.rand.org/blog/2013/08/us-china-and-an-unthinkable-war.html" target="_blank">pre-emptive strikes</a>.  Meaning, the response both sides have exclusively trained for in the event of confrontation is to attack the other first!</p>
<p>The seemingly simple and petty dispute over the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea actually provides a perfect environment for the pre-emptive powder keg to explode.</p>
<p>China has recently declared an “air defense zone” that extends over the islands, which Japan has already claimed as its own. China, South Korea and the United States have all moved to defy this defense zone. South Korea has even extended its own air defense zone to <a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/s-korea-expands-air-defence-zone-includes-islands-claimed-by-china-1.1580117" target="_blank">overlap China’s</a>.</p>
<p>China has responded with warnings that its military aircraft will now monitor the region and demands that other nations provide it with civilian airline flight paths.  China has also stated that it plans to <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2013/1205/Southeast-Asia-eyes-Chinese-air-zone-expansion-video">create MORE arbitrary defense zones</a> in the near future.</p>
<p>The U.S. government under Barack Obama has long planned a military shift into the Pacific, which is meant specifically to counter China’s increased presence. It’s almost as if the White House knew a confrontation <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/16/world/la-fg-obama-asia-20111117" target="_blank">was coming</a>.</p>
<p>The shift is now accelerating due to the Senkaku situation, as the U.S. transfers <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/02/us-japan-china-planes-idUSBRE9B104220131202" target="_blank">submarine-hunting jets</a> to Japan while <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/28/us-usa-china-idUSBRE9AQ0T920131128">pledging full support for Japan</a> should war ignite.</p>
<p>And most recently, the Japanese press has suggested that war between the two countries<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/28/us-usa-china-idUSBRE9AQ0T920131128">could erupt as early as January</a>.</p>
<p>China, with its limited navy, has focused more of its energy and funding into advanced missile technologies — including “ship killers,” which fly too low and fast to be detected with current radar.  This is the same strategy of cheap compact precision warfare being adopted by countries like Syria and Iran, and it is designed specifically to disrupt tradition American military tactics.</p>
<p>Currently, very little diplomatic headway has been made or attempted in regards to the Senkaku Islands. The culmination of various ingredients so far makes for a sour stew.</p>
<p>All that is required now is that one trigger event — that one ironic “twist of fate” that mainstream historians love so much, the spark that lights the fuse. China could suddenly sell a mass quantity of U.S. Treasuries, perhaps in response to the renewed debt debate next spring. The United States could use pre-emption to take down a Chinese military plane or submarine.  A random missile could destroy a passenger airliner traveling through the defense zone, and both sides could blame each other. The point is nothing good could come from the escalation over Senkaku.</p>
<p><strong>Why Is War Useful?</strong></p>
<p>What could possibly be gained by fomenting a war between the United States and China?  What could possibly be gained by throwing America&#8217;s economy, the supposed &#8220;goose that lays the golden eggs&#8221;, to the fiscal wolves?  As stated earlier, distraction is paramount, and fear is valuable political and social capital.</p>
<p>Global financiers created the circumstances that have led to America’s probable economic demise, but they don’t want to be blamed for it. War provides the perfect cover for monetary collapse, and a war with China might become the cover to end all covers. The resulting fiscal damage and the terror Americans would face could be overwhelming. Activists who question the legitimacy of the U.S. government and its actions, once considered champions of free speech, could easily be labeled “treasonous” during wartime by authorities and the frightened masses. (If the government is willing to use the Internal Revenue Service against us today, just think about who it will send after us during the chaos of a losing war tomorrow.) A lockdown of civil liberties could be instituted behind the fog of this national panic.</p>
<p>Primarily, war tends to influence the masses to agree to more centralization, to relinquish their rights in the name of the “greater good”, and to accept less transparency in government and more power in the hands of fewer people. Most important, though, is war&#8217;s usefulness as a philosophical manipulation after the dust has settled.</p>
<p>After nearly every war of the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> century, the subsequent propaganda implies one message in particular: National sovereignty, or nationalism, is the cause of all our problems. The establishment then claims that there is only one solution that will solve these problems: globalization. <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/comment/east-china-sea-islands-dispute-a-long-game-for-patient-china-20131208-2yz79.html">This article by Andrew Hunter</a>, the chairman of the Australian Fabian Society, is exactly the kind of narrative I expect to hear if conflict arises between the United States and China.</p>
<p>National identity and sovereignty are the scapegoats, and the Fabians (globalist propagandists) are quick to point a finger. Their assertion is that nation states should no longer exist, borders should be erased and a one-world economic system and government should be founded. Only then will war and financial strife end. Who will be in charge of this interdependent one world utopia? I’ll give you three guesses&#8230;</p>
<p>The Fabians, of course, make no mention of global bankers and their instigation of nearly every war and depression for the past 100 years; and these are invariably the same people that will end up in positions of authority if globalization comes to fruition. What the majority of people do not yet understand is that globalists have no loyalties to any particular country, and they are perfectly willing to sacrifice governments, economies, even entire cultures, in the pursuit of their &#8220;ideal society&#8221;.  &#8220;Order out of chaos&#8221; is their motto, after all.  The bottom line is that a war between China and the United States will not be caused by national sovereignty. Rather, it will be caused by elitists looking for a way to END national sovereignty. That’s why such a hypothetical conflict, a conflict that has been gamed by think tanks for years, is likely to be forced into reality.</p>

<p>“The white man wanted what we had, our land, but he didn’t want us.  We wanted what the white man had his improvements, his guns, his modern conveniences – but we didn’t want him.  And so we fought, each wanting what the other had but not wanting the other and trying to eliminate him; and we lost.  That’s the story.”    A mid-Twentieth Century account by an old Indian at the Owyhee reservation in Nevada.  From “The American Indian” R. J. Rushdoony</p>
<p>The late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rousas_John_Rushdoony  ">Rousas Rushdoony</a> was born to immigrant parents and raised in an Armenian society on a farm in California.   He was a Christian truth-seeker with a brilliant mind, a photographic memory, and a work driven disposition.  His perspective on the American culture was not maligned by popular partisan descriptions and his accurate evaluations were often prophetic.</p>
<p>Though we never met his writing transformed my understanding of Christianity.</p>
<p>Truth steps on the toes of those who live and defend fantasy and Rushdoony had big feet.  Arminianism denuded Christianity.  It is a ubiquitous heresy and Rushdoony brought the full weight of his mighty intellect against it.  He exposed the sinful insanity of claiming to follow Christ while refusing to obey His legal standards.  As it always does his true pronouncements dragged him into controversy.</p>
<p>Ross House Books recently released “The American Indian” a paper-backed book of slightly over 100 pages. It chronicles Rushdoony’s mission to the Shoshone and Paiute Indians at the Owyhee reservation in Nevada from 1944 to 1953.    <span style="color: #0000ff;"> </p>
<p>Rushdoony’s portrays the Indian differently than the dream laden pictures presented in our movies and history books.  He found the older Indians to be astute, realistic, and pragmatic.  They were quick to notice that White American Christians did not actually believe in the religion they were trying to transmit; they did not practice it, their schools did not teach it, and their government did not follow its principles.  This sad reality resulted in the subtitle of the book, “A Standing Indictment Against Christianity and Statism in America.</p>
<p>Rushdoony liked and admired the Indian character.  They were realists and so was he.  Yes, they were savages capable of shocking cruelty but they were also open to technical advances and were more willing to offer others hospitality than most Christians.  An Indian was never without food and shelter since every family would unquestionably provide it whether to a stray adult or an orphaned child.</p>
<p>The book vividly portrays the devastation that results from dependence on government handouts. Tribal life centered on survival and since the government provided everything they needed the core of their life was destroyed. The result is wide spread debauchery, gambling, alcoholism, sexually immorality, and rape.</p>
<p>A tendency to addiction combined with the malignancy of government dependence contributed to the alcohol problem.  The old Indians called it “The Whiskey Religion”.  They reasoned that what Christians look for in Christ, alcoholic Indians (Whites too) find in the bottle.  Alcohol was not the only problem: Peyote, a narcotic, was worshiped and used extensively with devastating results.    </p>
<p>Indian children were coddled; never disciplined.  Rushdoony reasoned that such leniency resulted in an inability to withstand frustration and this weakness contributed to widespread alcoholism.  When the doctrine of original sin is missing discipline is usually lacking.</p>
<p>Indians were trained to be valiant.  The old Indians remembered in past times young Indians entered manhood through a ritual that involved cutting open and exposing back muscles that were then thonged and tightened to keep the initiate on his tiptoes.  They were forbidden to acknowledge pain and urged to dance around a pole for three days and nights.  If they passed out they ruptured their back muscles and waited at least another year to enter manhood. </p>
<p>Before the arrival of the White man survival was the primary objective of Indian culture.  The story of Jenny Owyhee showcases Indian spiritism, savagery, and intent to survive.  Jenny and Rushdoony arrived on the Reservation about the same time.  Jenny had worked for a family named Riddle.  Grant Riddle died at the age of eighty. He said Jenny had worked for his family before he was born and had grown children when he was a child.  She remembered the tribe being marched to the Reservation and would have been close to 120 year of age.  Rushdoony writes, “Jenny told me that her first four babies were girls.  At the birth of the fourth, her husband broke the power of the spirits by grabbing the new-born girl and braining her on a rock.  Jenny’s next child was a boy.  She was a kind and thoughtful woman. For her, the killing of the girl was a sad necessity in order to insure a boy – for a boy meant survival in the wilderness.”</p>
<p>Rushdoony had great respect for Indians warriors.  He believed Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce Indians was the “greatest military strategist the North American continent has ever produced.   He writes that Chief Joseph with a “handful” of warriors defeated the U. S. Army several times while transporting and protecting a large number of women and children.  Superior numbers and superior equipment were needed to defeat the resilient Indians who refused to give up.</p>
<p>Indians were never enslaved; they fought or they ran away.   They could not be converted to servant hood.  The older Indians viewed Negros as inferior because they allowed themselves to become slaves.</p>
<p>Both the writer and the Indians had great respect for realism.  Sentimentality is condemned and there is no reference to repentance. Rushdoony expresses disdain for recounting past offenses instead of concentrating on current behavior.  He recounted the indiscretions of both the Indians and the White settlers.  The White settlers bore additional guilt because they were supposedly Christians but there is nothing about the incursion of European civilization into what had previously been Indian occupied territory.</p>
<p>Important information about this period of Rushdoony’s ministry is mysteriously missing.  His first wife, Arda, bore him four children (Rebecca, Joanna, Sharon, and Martha) and they adopted an Indian child (Ronald).  Arda is not mention in his writing nor is her image found in the several pictures taken at the Owyhee Reservation. Following a divorce she became a non-person.  Dorothy Rushdoony, his second wife, who after giving birth to a son (Thomas Kirkwood, Jr.), had also been divorced, took Arda’s place as if she never existed.  I could find only one reference to Arda on the Internet.  Read it <a href="http://heresyintheheartland.blogspot.com/2013/08/voiceless-women-arda-j-rushdoony.html  ">here</a>.</p>
<p>There may be good reason for the dearth of information on Arda and Ronald Rushdoony; but since information is not available the mystery remains.  These events certainly influenced the family.</p>
<p>An appropriate ending to this essay comes from a story Rushdoony recounts about a Whisky religion renegade Indian who had been in the armed services and occupied various jails around the country.  In the midst of a session of bragging about his brawls he became serious and said, “Look at those people of mine.  They’re no good.  They’re like me, just no account.  All they are fit for is a reservation where someone puts a fence around them.  That’s it.  They are not fit for anything else.”</p>
<p>“But,” he went on, “I’ve been across the country two or three times now in the last few years, and I’ve learned something: the white man isn’t much better.  He has reservation fever now.  He wants someone to put a fence around the whole North American continent and take care of him.  He wants the government to give him a handout and look after him just like Uncle Sam looks after us. And he is going to get it. If some outfit doesn’t come in and do it for him, some foreign country will turn the whole United States into a reservation: he’ll to do it to himself.  You wait and see. ‘Cause he’s got reservation fever.”</p>

<p><b>Would you be surprised to hear that the human race is slowly becoming dumber, and dumber?</b></p>
<p>Despite our advancements over the last tens or even hundreds of years, some ‘experts’ believe that humans are losing cognitive capabilities and becoming more emotionally unstable. One Stanford University researcher and geneticist, Dr. Gerald Crabtree, believes that our intellectual decline as a race has much to do with adverse genetic mutations. But human intelligence is suffering for other reasons as well.</p>
<p>According to Crabtree, our cognitive and emotional capabilities are fueled and determined by the combined effort of thousands of genes. If a mutation occurred in any of of these genes, which is quite likely, then intelligence or emotional stability can be negatively impacted.</p>
<p>“I would wager that if an average citizen from Athens of 1000 BC were to appear suddenly among us, he or she would be among the brightest and most intellectually alive of our colleagues and companions, with a good memory, a broad range of ideas, and a clear-sighted view of important issues. Furthermore, I would guess that he or she would be among the most emotionally stable of our friends and colleagues,” the geneticist began his article in the scientific journal Trends in Genetics.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.redicecreations.com/ul_img/28015idiocracy-1_1.jpg" align="left" />Further, the geneticist explains that people with specific adverse genetic mutations are more likely than ever to survive and live amongst the ‘strong.’ Darwin’s theory of ‘survival of the fittest’ is less applicable in today’s society, therefore those with better genes will not necessarily dominate in society as they would have in the past.</p>
<p>While this hypothesis does have some merit: are genes really the primary reason for the overall cognitive decline of the human race? If humans really are lacking in intelligence more than before, it’s important to recognize other possible causes. Let’s take a look at how our food system plays a role in all of this.</p>
<p>It’s sad, but true; our <b>food system today</b> is contributing to <b>lower human intelligence</b>across the board.</p>
<p><b>Pesticides are Diminishing Human Intelligence</b></p>
<p>One study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that pesticides, which are rampant among the food supply, are creating lasting changes in overall brain structure — changes that have been linked to lower intelligence levels and decreased cognitive function. Specifically, the researchers found that a pesticide known as chlorpyrifos (CPF) has been linked to ”significant abnormalities”. Further, the negative impact was found to occur even at low levels of exposure.</p>
<p>Lead researcher Virginia Rauh, a professor at the Mailman School of Public Health, summarized the findings:</p>
<p>“Toxic exposure during this critical period can have far-reaching effects on brain development and behavioral functioning.”</p>
<p><b>Processed Foods, High Fructose Corn Syrup Making People ‘Stupid’</b></p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.redicecreations.com/ul_img/28015rundown.jpg" align="right" />Following 14,000 children, British researchers uncovered the connection between processed foods and reduced IQ. After recording the children’s’ diets and analyzing questionnaires submitting by the parents, the researchers found that if children were consuming a processed diet at age 3, IQ decline could begin over the next five years. The study found that by age 8, the children had suffered the IQ decline. On the contrary, children who ate a nutrient-rich diet including fruit and vegetables were found to increase their IQ over the 3 year period. The foods considered nutrient-rich by the researchers were most likely conventional fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>Interestingly, one particular ingredient ubiquitous in processed foods and sugary beverages across the globe -high fructose corn syrup – has been tied to reduced IQ. The UCLA researchers coming to these findings found that HFCS may be damaging the brain functions of consumers worldwide, sabotaging learning and memory. In fact, the official release goes as far to say that high-fructose corn syrup can make you ‘stupid’.</p>
<p>Gene mutations may have something to do with the ongoing decline in human intelligence, but let’s stop to think for a moment what we’re doing to ourselves to make this decline even more prominent.</p>

<p>It is often said there only two kinds of people in this world: those who know, and those who don’t. I would expand on this and say that there are actually three kinds of people: those who know, those who don’t know, and those who don’t care to know. Members of the last group are the kind of people I would characterize as “sheeple.”</p>
<p>Sheeple are members of a culture or society who are not necessarily oblivious to the reality of their surroundings; they may have been exposed to valuable truths on numerous occasions. However, when confronted with facts contrary to their conditioned viewpoint, they become aggressive and antagonistic in their behavior, seeking to dismiss and attack the truth by attacking the messenger and denying reason.  Sheeple exist on both sides of America&#8217;s false political paradigm, and they exist in all social &#8220;classes&#8221;.  In fact, the &#8220;professional class&#8221; and the hierarchy of academia are rampant breeding grounds for sheeple; who I sometimes refer to as &#8220;intellectual idiots&#8221;.  Doctors and lawyers, scientists and politicians are all just as prone to the sheeple plague as anyone else; the only difference is that they have a bureaucratic apparatus behind them which gives them a false sense of importance.  All they have to do is tow the establishment line, and promote the establishment view.</p>
<p>Of course the common argument made by sheeple is that EVERYONE thinks everyone else is blind to the truth, which in their minds, somehow vindicates their behavior.  However, the characteristic that absolutely defines a sheeple is not necessarily a lack of knowledge, but an unwillingness to consider or embrace obvious logic or truth in order to protect their egos and biases from harm.  A sheeple&#8217;s mindset is driven by self centered motives.</p>
<p>So-called mainstream media outlets go out of their way to reinforce this aggressive mindset by establishing the illusion that sheeple are the “majority” and that the majority perception (which has been constructed by the MSM) is the only correct perception.</p>
<p>Many liberty movement activists have noted recently that there has been a surge in media propaganda aimed at painting the survival, preparedness and liberty cultures as “fringe,” “reactionary,” “extremist,” “conspiracy-minded,” etc. National Geographic’s television show “Doomsday Preppers” appears to have been designed specifically to seek out the worst possible representatives of the movement and parade their failings like a carnival sideshow. Rarely do they give focus to the logical arguments regarding why their subjects become preppers, nor do they normally choose subjects who can explain as much in a coherent manner. This is a very similar tactic used by the establishment media at large-scale protests; they generally attempt to interview the least-eloquent and easiest-to-ridicule person present and make that person a momentary mascot for the entire group and the philosophy they hold dear.</p>
<p>The goal is to give sheeple comfort that they are “normal” and that anyone who steps outside the bounds of the mainstream is “abnormal” and a welcome target for the collective.</p>
<p>It would appear that the life of a sheeple is a life of relative bliss. The whole of the establishment machine seems engineered to make them happy and the rest of us miserable. But is a sheeple’s existence the ideal? Are they actually happy in their ignorance? Are they truly safe within the confines of the system? Here a just a few reasons why you should feel sorry for them.</p>
<p><strong>Sheeple Are Nothing Without The Collective</strong></p>
<p>A sheeple gathers his entire identity from the group. He acts the way he believes the group wants him to act. He thinks the way he believes the group wants him to think. All of his “ideas” are notions pre-approved by the mainstream. All of his arguments and talking points are positions he heard from the media, or academia, and he has never formed an original opinion in his life. Without the group telling him what to do, the average sheeple is lost and disoriented. When cast into a crisis situation requiring individual initiative, he panics or becomes apathetic, waiting for the system to come and save him rather than taking care of himself. Sheeple are so dependent on others for every aspect of their personality and their survival that when faced with disaster, they are the most likely people to curl up and die.</p>
<p><strong>Sheeple Crave Constant Approval From Others</strong></p>
<p>Sheeple are not only reliant on the collective for their identity and their survival; they also need a steady supplement of approval from others in order to function day to day. When a sheeple leaves his home, he is worried about how his appearance is perceived, how his attitude is perceived, how his lifestyle is perceived and how his opinions are perceived. Everything he does from the moment his day begins revolves around ensuring that the collective approves of him. Even his acts of “rebellion” are often merely approved forms of superficial “individualism” reliant on style rather than substance. This approval becomes a kind of emotional drug to which the sheeple is addicted. He will never make waves among the herd or stand out against any aspect of the herd worldview, because their approval sustains and cements his very existence. To take collective approval away from him would be like cutting off a heroin junky’s supplier. To be shunned by the group would destroy him psychologically.</p>
<p><strong>Sheeple Are Incapable Of Original Creativity</strong></p>
<p>Because sheeple spend most of their waking moments trying to appease the collective, they rarely, if ever, have the energy or inclination to create something of their own. Sheeple do not make astonishing works of art. They do not achieve scientific discovery. They do not make history through philosophical or ideological innovation.  Instead, they regurgitate the words of others and hijack ideas from greater minds.  They remain constant spectators in life, watching change from the bleachers, caught in the tides of time and tossed about like congealed satellites of Pacific Ocean garbage from the after-wash of Fukushima. The destiny of the common sheeple is entirely determined by the outcome of wars and restorations waged by small groups of aware individuals — some of them good, some of them evil.</p>
<p><strong>Sheeple Have No Passion</strong></p>
<p>If you draw all of your beliefs from what the collective deems acceptable, then it is difficult, if not impossible, to become legitimately passionate about them. Sheeple have little to no personal connection to their ideals or principles; so they become mutable, empty and uninspired. They tend to turn toward cynicism as a way to compensate, making fun of everything, especially those who ARE passionate about something. The only ideal that they will fight for is the collective itself, because who they are is so intertwined with the survival of the system. To threaten the concept of the collective is to threaten the sheeple’s existence by extension.</p>
<p><strong>Sheeple Are Useless</strong></p>
<p>The average sheeple does not learn how to be self-reliant because it is considered “abnormal” by the mainstream to be self-reliant. The collective and the state are the provider. They are mother and father. Sheeple have full faith that the system will protect them from any and all harm. When violence erupts, they cower and hide instead of defending themselves and others. When large-scale catastrophe strikes, they either sit idle waiting for the state to save them or they join yet another irrational mob. They do not take proactive measures, because they never felt the need to learn how.</p>
<p>Consider this: Why do the mainstream and the people subject to it care if others prepare for disaster or end their dependency on the establishment? Why are they so desperate to attack those of us who find our own path? If the system is so effective and the collective so correct in its methodology, then individualists are hurting only themselves by walking away, right? But for the sheeple, successfully self-reliant individuals become a constant reminder of their own inadequacies. They feel that if they cannot survive without the system, NO ONE can survive without the system; and they will make sure that individualists never prove otherwise. “You didn’t build that” becomes the sheeple motto, as they scratch and scrape like spoiled children, trying to dismantle the momentum of independent movements and ventures in non-participation.</p>
<p><strong>Sheeple Are Easily Forgotten</strong></p>
<p>To live a life of endless acceptance is to live a life of meaningless obscurity. When one arrives at his deathbed, does he want to reflect on all of his regrets or all of his accomplishments? Most of us would rather find joy than sadness when looking back over our past. For sheeple, though, this will not be possible — for what have they ever done besides conform? What will they have left behind except a world worse off than when they were born? What will they have accomplished, but more pain and struggle for future generations? In the end, what have their lives really been worth?</p>
<p>I cannot imagine a torture more vicious and terrifying than to realize in the face of one’s final days that one wasted his entire life trying to please the plethora of idiots around him, instead of educating them and himself and molding tomorrow for the better. I cannot imagine a punishment more severe than to spend the majority of one’s years as a slave without even knowing it. I cannot imagine an existence more deserving of pity and remorse than that of the sheeple.</p>

			<p>New York &#8211; Jeremy Hammond sat in New York’s Metropolitan Correctional Center last week in a small room reserved for visits from attorneys. He was wearing an oversized prison jumpsuit. The brown hair of the lanky 6-footer fell over his ears, and he had a wispy beard. He spoke with the intensity and clarity one would expect from one of the nation’s most important political prisoners.</p>
<p>On Friday the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/28/jeremy-hammond-anonymous-hacker-guilty-stratfor_n_3347215.html">28-year-old activist</a> will appear for sentencing in the Southern District Court of New York in Manhattan. After having made a plea agreement, he faces the possibility of a 10-year sentence for hacking into the Texas-based private security firm Strategic Forecasting Inc., or Stratfor, which does work for the Homeland Security Department, the Marine Corps, the Defense Intelligence Agency and numerous corporations including Dow Chemical and Raytheon.</p>
<p>Four others involved in the hacking have been convicted in Britain, and they were sentenced to less time combined—the longest sentence was 32 months—than the potential 120-month sentence that lies before Hammond.</p>
<p>Hammond turned the pilfered information over to the website WikiLeaks and <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/the-rise-and-fall-of-jeremy-hammond-enemy-of-the-state-20121207">Rolling Stone</a> and other publications. The 3 million email exchanges, once</p>

<p>made public, exposed the private security firm’s infiltration, monitoring and surveillance of protesters and dissidents, especially in the Occupy movement, on behalf of corporations and the national security state. And, perhaps most important, the information provided chilling evidence that anti-terrorism laws are being routinely used by the federal government to criminalize nonviolent, democratic dissent and falsely link dissidents to international terrorist organizations. Hammond sought no financial gain. He got none.The email exchanges Hammond made public were entered as evidence in <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/the_last_chance_to_stop_the_ndaa_20130902">my lawsuit</a>against President Barack Obama over Section 1021 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Section 1021 permits the military to seize citizens who are deemed by the state to be terrorists, strip them of due process and hold them indefinitely in military facilities. Alexa O’Brien, a content strategist and journalist who co-founded US Day of Rage, an organization created to reform the election process, was one of my co-plaintiffs. Stratfor officials attempted, we know because of the Hammond leaks, to falsely link her and her organization to Islamic radicals and websites as well as to jihadist ideology, putting her at risk of detention under the new law. Judge Katherine B. Forrest ruled, in part because of the leak, that we plaintiffs had a credible fear, and she nullified the law, a decision that an appellate court overturned when the Obama administration appealed it.</p>
<p>Freedom of the press and legal protection for those who expose government abuses and lies have been obliterated by the corporate state. The resulting self-exile of investigative journalists such as <a href="http://www.advocate.com/print-issue/current-issue/2013/10/24/enemy-state">Glenn Greenwald</a>, <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/jacob-appelbaum-utopia-interview">Jacob Appelbaum</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/laura-poitras-snowden.html">Laura Poitras</a>, along with the indictment of <a href="http://freebarrettbrown.org/">Barret Brown</a>, illustrate this. All acts of resistance—including nonviolent protest—have been conflated by the corporate state with terrorism. The mainstream, commercial press has been emasculated through the Obama administration’s repeated use of the Espionage Act to charge and sentence traditional whistle-blowers. Governmental officials with a conscience are too frightened to reach out to mainstream reporters, knowing that the authorities’ wholesale capturing and storing of electronic forms of communication make them easily identifiable.</p>
<p>Elected officials and the courts no longer impose restraint or practice oversight. The last line of defense lies with those such as Hammond, Julian Assange, Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning who are capable of burrowing into the records of the security and surveillance state and have the courage to pass them on to the public. But the price of resistance is high.</p>
<p>“In these times of secrecy and abuse of power there is only one solution—transparency,” wrote <a href="http://www.dw.de/sarah-harrison-ally-of-ex-nsa-contractor-snowden-in-germany/a-17211444">Sarah Harrison</a>, the British journalist who accompanied Snowden to Russia and who also has gone into exile, in Berlin. “If our governments are so compromised that they will not tell us the truth, then we must step forward to grasp it. Provided with the unequivocal proof of primary source documents people can fight back. If our governments will not give this information to us, then we must take it for ourselves.”</p>
<p>“When whistleblowers come forward we need to fight for them, so others will be encouraged,” she went on. “When they are gagged, we must be their voice. When they are hunted, we must be their shield. When they are locked away, we must free them. Giving us the truth is not a crime. This is our data, our information, our history. We must fight to own it. Courage is contagious.”</p>
<p>Hammond knows this contagion. He was living at home in Chicago in 2010 under a 7-a.m.-to-7-p.m. curfew for a variety of acts of civil disobedience when Chelsea (formerly Bradley) Manning was arrested for giving WikiLeaks secret information about military war crimes and government lies. Hammond at the time was running social aid programs to feed the hungry and send books to prisoners. He had, like Manning, displayed a remarkable aptitude for science, math and computer languages at a young age. He hacked into the computers at a local Apple store at 16. He hacked into the computer science department’s website at the University of Illinois-Chicago as a freshman, a prank that saw the university refuse to allow him to return for his sophomore year. He was an early backer of “cyber-liberation” and in 2004 started an “electronic-disobedience journal” he named Hack This Zine. He called on hackers in a speech at the 2004 DefCon convention in Las Vegas to use their skills to disrupt that year’s Republican National Convention. He was, by the time of his 2012 arrest, one of the shadowy stars of the hacktivist underground, dominated by groups such as Anonymous and WikiLeaks in which anonymity, stringent security and frequent changes of aliases alone ensured success and survival. Manning’s courage prompted Hammond to his own act of cyber civil disobedience, although he knew his chances of being caught were high.</p>
<p>“I saw what Chelsea Manning did,” Hammond said when we spoke last Wednesday, seated at a metal table. “Through her hacking she became a contender, a world changer. She took tremendous risks to show the ugly truth about war. I asked myself, if she could make that risk shouldn’t I make that risk? Wasn’t it wrong to sit comfortably by, working on the websites of Food Not Bombs, while I had the skills to do something similar? I too could make a difference. It was her courage that prompted me to act.”</p>
<p>Hammond—who has black-inked tattoos on each forearm, one the open-source movement’s symbol known as <a href="http://www.catb.org/hacker-emblem/">the “glider”</a> and the other <a href="http://www.iching123.com/7_text.htm">the shi hexagram</a> from the I Ching—is steeped in radical thought. As a teenager, he swiftly migrated politically from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party to the militancy of the <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/the_cancer_of_occupy_20120206">Black Bloc</a> anarchists. He was an avid reader in high school of material put out by <a href="http://www.crimethinc.com/">CrimethInc</a>, an anarchist collective that publishes anarchist literature and manifestos. He has molded himself after old radicals such as Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman and black revolutionaries such as George Jackson, Elaine Brown and Assata Shakur, as well as members of the Weather Underground. He said that while he was in Chicago he made numerous trips to Waldheim Cemetery to visit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Haymarket_Martyr's_Memorial.jpg">Haymarket Martyrs Monument</a>, which honors four anarchists who were hanged in 1887 and others who took part in the labor wars. On the 16-foot-high granite monument are the final words of one of the condemned men, August Spies. It reads: “The day will come when our silence will be more powerful than the voice you are throttling today.” Emma Goldman is buried nearby.</p>
<p>Hammond became well known to the government for a variety of acts of civil disobedience over the last decade. These ranged from painting anti-war graffiti on Chicago walls to protesting at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York to hacking into the right-wing website Protest Warrior, for which he was sentenced to two years in the Federal Correctional Institute at Greenville, Ill.</p>
<p>He said he is fighting as “an anarchist communist” against “centralized state authority” and “exploitative corporations.” His goal is to build “leaderless collectives based on free association, consensus, mutual aid, self-sufficiency and harmony with the environment.” It is essential, he said, that all of us work to cut our personal ties with capitalism and engage in “mass organizing of protests, strikes and boycotts.” Hacking and leaking, he said, are part of this resistance—“effective tools to reveal ugly truths of the system.”</p>
<p>Hammond spent months within the Occupy movement in Chicago. He embraced its “leaderless, non-hierarchical structures such as general assemblies and consensus, and occupying public spaces.” But he was highly critical of what he said were the “vague politics” in Occupy that allowed it to include followers of the libertarian Ron Paul, some in the tea party, as well as “reformist liberals and Democrats.” Hammond said he was not interested in any movement that “only wanted a ‘nicer’ form of capitalism and favored legal reforms, not revolution.” He remains rooted in the ethos of the Black Bloc.</p>
<p>“Being incarcerated has really opened my eyes to the reality of the criminal justice system,” he said, “that it is not a criminal justice system about public safety or rehabilitation, but reaping profits through mass incarceration. There are two kinds of justice—one for the rich and the powerful who get away with the big crimes, then for everyone else, especially people of color and the impoverished. There is no such thing as a fair trial. In over 80 percent of the cases people are pressured to plea out instead of exercising their right to trial, under the threat of lengthier sentences. I believe no satisfactory reforms are possible. We need to close all prisons and release everybody unconditionally.”</p>
<p>He said he hoped his act of resistance would encourage others, just as Manning’s courage had inspired him. He said activists should “know and accept the worst possible repercussion” before carrying out an action and should be “aware of mass counterintelligence/surveillance operations targeting our movements.” An informant posing as a comrade, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector_Xavier_Monsegur">Hector Xavier Monsegur</a>, known online as “Sabu,” turned Hammond and his co-defendants in to the FBI. Monsegur stored data retrieved by Hammond on an external server in New York. This tenuous New York connection allowed the government to try Hammond in New York for hacking from his home in Chicago into a private security firm based in Texas. New York is the center of the government’s probes into cyber-warfare; it is where federal authorities apparently wanted Hammond to be investigated and charged.</p>
<p>Hammond said he will continue to resist from within prison. A series of minor infractions, as well as testing positive with other prisoners on his tier for marijuana that had been smuggled into the facility, has resulted in his losing social visits for the next two years and spending “time in the box [solitary confinement].” He is allowed to see journalists, but my request to interview him took two months to be approved. He said prison involves “a lot of boredom.” He plays chess, teaches guitar and helps other prisoners study for their GED. When I saw him, he was working on the statement, a personal manifesto, that he will read in court this week.</p>
<p>He insisted he did not see himself as different from prisoners, especially poor prisoners of color, who are in for common crimes, especially drug-related crimes. He said most inmates are political prisoners, caged unjustly by a system of totalitarian capitalism that has snuffed out basic opportunities for democratic dissent and economic survival.</p>
<p>“The majority of people in prison did what they had to do to survive,” he said. “Most were poor. They got caught up in the war on drugs, which is how you make money if you are poor. The real reason they get locked in prison for so long is so corporations can continue to make big profits. It is not about justice. I do not draw distinctions between us.”</p>
<p>“Jail is essentially enduring harassment and dehumanizing conditions with frequent lockdowns and shakedowns,” he said. “You have to constantly fight for respect from the guards, sometimes getting yourself thrown in the box. However, I will not change the way I live because I am locked up. I will continue to be defiant, agitating and organizing whenever possible.”</p>
<p>He said resistance must be a way of life. He intends to return to community organizing when he is released, although he said he will work to stay out of prison. “The truth,” he said, “will always come out.” He cautioned activists to be hyper-vigilant and aware that “one mistake can be permanent.” But he added, “Don’t let paranoia or fear deter you from activism. Do the down thing!”</p>
