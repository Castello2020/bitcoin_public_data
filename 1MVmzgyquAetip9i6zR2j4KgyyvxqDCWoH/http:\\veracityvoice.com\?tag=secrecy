<p>The Robber Barons of the 19th and 20th century had nothing over the elites of today’s globalist transnational financial conglomerates. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2014/03/03/forbes-billionaires-full-list-of-the-richest-americans/">The Richest Americans</a>, listed in Forbes conceals the real power that controls the economy. Net worth is deficient in gauging dominance in financial commercialism and monetary preeminence.

Those who demand higher minimum wage compensation do not understand how business works. The inordinate wealth divide, cannot and will not be reduced, until genuine economic prosperity is achieved.</p>
<p>Analyze the idiocy of a naive Undergraduate Research Fellow, Brian Chesley in <a href="http://www.mn2020hindsight.org/view/3-ways-to-reduce-the-wealth-gap">3 Ways to Reduce the Wealth Gap</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
1. Open higher education to everyone.</p>
<p>2. Increase the minimum wage.</p>
<p>3. Increase taxes on the rich.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Such ignorant and illiterate attitudes demonstrate that institutions of higher learning encourage an atmosphere of social collectivism that plays directly into the hands of the new tyrannical tycoons.</p>
<p>The New York Times OP-ED piece by Daniel Altman (an adjunct associate professor of economics at the New York University Stern School of Business and a former member of the New York Times editorial board), proposes a foolish mindset and proposal in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/19/opinion/to-reduce-inequality-tax-wealth-not-income.html?_r=0">To Reduce Inequality, Tax Wealth, Not Income</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In 1992, the top tenth of the population controlled 20 times the wealth controlled by the bottom half. By 2010, it was 65 times. Our graduated income-tax system redistributes a small amount of money every year but does little to slow the polarization of wealth.&#8221;</p>
<p>American household wealth totaled more than $58 trillion in 2010. A flat wealth tax of just 1.5 percent on financial assets and other wealth like housing, cars and business ownership would have been more than enough to replace all the revenue of the income, estate and gift taxes, which amounted to about $833 billion after refunds. Brackets of, say, zero percent up to $500,000 in wealth, 1 percent for wealth between $500,000 and $1 million, and 2 percent for wealth above $1 million would probably have done the trick as well.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Absent in redistribution of wealth schemes is that the method of authentic free enterprise is never understood. Nor is there ever an effort to reestablish the principles of real business competition. The marketplace of voluntary and mutually beneficial commercial transactions, destroyed by the systemic Corporatocracy model, is the ultimate reason why wealth disparity is so great. The literal legacy of the Robber Barons is the internationalist financial system of central banking that predetermines the outcomes of selective patrons from calculating crony capitalism.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/CorporateProfitsWagesCartoon.jpg" alt="CorporateProfitsWagesCartoon.jpg" align="right" /></p>
<p>Public companies, once established to develop, produce and sell innovative goods or services are rare in an environment where financial manipulation is the primary vehicle to riches. Equity exchanges, based upon raising capital for industrious and constructive ventures, seldom function for this utilitarian purpose. The global economy, in reality, has perfected an anti-free enterprise filter that stamps out initiative and penalties upstarts that are not part of the cartels.</p>
<p>With the insolvency of the world-banking system an inescapable fact, the prospects for even more concentration of real assets into the hands of the financial elites, posed for the final wealth confiscation, of resources not already in their hands, is upon us.</p>
<p>When the internationalist financial system implodes and business screeches to a halt, a populist movement to clawback century long fraudulent gains of the hidden stashes from the interlocked illuminati families is the only coherent alternative to establish a fiscally sound financial future.</p>
<div>Julie Lévesque writes in Global Research, <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/bilderberg-2014-war-criminals-big-oil-and-too-big-to-jail-banksters-meet-in-secrecy/5384502">Bilderberg 2014: War Criminals, Big Oil and &#8220;Too Big to Jail&#8221; Banksters Meet in Secrecy</a>. He also cites our Negotium essay, <a href="http://www.batr.org/negotium/081512.html">Goldman Sachs Above the Law</a>.</div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The 2014 Bilderberg meeting is another example of those &#8220;blurred lines&#8221; between government, big oil and the financial sector, the three pillars of war. According to some <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/bilderberg-agenda-revealed-elite-desperate-to-rescue-unipolar-world/5384291?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=bilderberg-agenda-revealed-elite-desperate-to-rescue-unipolar-world">reports</a>, the topics of discussion at this year’s meeting will include the situation in Ukraine and the Russia-NATO relationship, as well as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), an agreement which, <a href="http://stopttip.net/">according to Stop TTIP</a>, &#8220;is in fact a corporate coup that will take us to a ‘corporatocracy’, a corporate-run world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The mental confusion that blocks out the way the world fundamentally functions prevents focusing upon any essential debate as to substitute economic parameters for an equitable stake and remuneration for productive contributions to the success of any commercial venture.</p>
<p>The term Robber Barons, should not be substituted for every prosperous risk taker or self-made entrepreneur. The corruption within the cabal economy is rooted in the very nature of the favorable treatment given to participants in the criminal corporatist syndicate.</p>
<p>As Ms. Lévesque correctly describes the methods and operations of this New World Order neo-feudalism, the only structure that offers any prospects for an economic renaissance must target and strip the political influence of the globalists as much as the confiscation of their vast holdings.</p>
<p>Do not be deceived, by communist or socialist newspeak. Sharing the wealth is not the objective. The goal is imposing an unconditionally surrender upon the banksters, which is serious business. Start with the elimination of the <a href="http://www.batr.org/negotium/100913.html">Rehypothecation of Collateral</a>. Lawful business has no room for coexistence with derivatives and swaps.Holding the body politic accountable and committed to breaking up the banksters’ monopoly requires compliance regulatory resistance from within the business community. It is just as important as customer and buyer rejection of the corporate induced consumer society. Sadly, most people simply are uninformed about the principles of sound business.</p>
<p>Most CEO’s are not businesspersons, but are globalist enablers and often are outright thieves. The needed business revolution will not be lead by their ilk.</p>
<p>Real competition can never be encouraged until inventive and audacious risk-takers have practical alternatives to fund their enterprises. Only then, will the wealth ratio narrow as affluence, that is more tangible, expands and the fortunes of the oligarchy diminish.</p>

<p>On the surface, the economic atmosphere of the U.S. has appeared rather calm and uneventful. Stocks are up, employment isn’t great but jobs aren’t collapsing into the void (at least not openly), and the U.S. dollar seems to be going strong. Peel away the thin veneer, however, and a different financial horror show is revealed.</p>
<p>U.S. stocks have enjoyed unprecedented crash protection due to a steady infusion of fiat money from the Federal Reserve known as quantitative easing. With the advent of the “taper”, QE is now swiftly coming to a close (as is evident in the overall reduction in treasury market purchases), and is slated to end by this fall, if not sooner.</p>
<p>Employment has been boosted only in statistical presentation, and not in reality. The Labor Department’s creative accounting of job numbers omits numerous factors, the most important being the issue of long term unemployed. Millions of people who have been jobless for so long they no longer qualify for benefits are being removed from the rolls. This quiet catastrophe has the side bonus of making it appear as though unemployment is going down.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury bonds, and by extension the dollar, have also stayed afloat due to the river of stimulus being introduced by the Federal Reserve. That same river, through QE, is now drying up.</p>
<p>In my article <em><a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/1977-the-final-swindle-of-private-american-wealth-has-begun" target="_blank">The Final Swindle Of Private American Wealth Has Begun</a>, </em>I outline the data which leads me to believe that the Fed taper is a deliberate action in preparation for an impending market collapse. The effectiveness of QE stimulus has a shelf-life, and that shelf life has come to an end. With debt monetization no longer a useful tool in propping up the ailing U.S. economy, central bankers are publicly stepping back. Why? If a collapse occurs while stimulus is in full swing, the Fed immediately takes full blame for the calamity, while being forced to admit that central banking as a concept serves absolutely no meaningful purpose.</p>
<p>My research over many years has led me to conclude that a collapse of the American system is not only expected by international financiers, but is in fact being engineered by them. The Fed is an entity created by globalists for globalists. These people have no loyalties to any one country or culture. Their only loyalties are to themselves and their private organizations.</p>
<p>While many people assume that the stimulus measures of the Fed are driven by a desire to save our economy and currency, I see instead a concerted program of destabilization which is<em>meant </em>to bring about the eventual demise of our nation’s fiscal infrastructure. What some might call “kicking the can down the road,” I call deliberately stretching the country thin over time, so that any indirect crisis can be used as a trigger event to bring the ceiling crashing down.</p>
<p>In the past several months, the Fed taper of QE and subsequently U.S. bond buying has coincided with steep declines in purchases by China, a dump of one-fifth of holdings by Russia, and an overall decline<a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-20/pboc-says-no-longer-in-china-s-favor-to-boost-record-reserves.html" target="_blank"> in new purchases of U.S. dollars for FOREX reserves.</a></p>
<p>With the Ukraine crisis now escalating to fever pitch, BRIC nations are openly discussing the probability of “de-dollarization” in international summits, and the ultimate dumping of the dollar<a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-05-13/russia-holds-de-dollarization-meeting-china-iran-willing-drop-usd-bilateral-trade" target="_blank">as the world reserve currency.</a></p>
<p>The U.S. is in desperate need of a benefactor to purchase its ever rising debt and keep the system running. Strangely, a buyer with apparently bottomless pockets has arrived to pick up the slack that the Fed and the BRICS are leaving behind. But, who is this buyer?</p>
<p>At first glance, it appears to be the tiny nation of <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/15/usa-economy-capital-idUSL1N0O117Z20140515" target="_blank">Belgium</a>.</p>
<p>While foreign investment in the U.S. has sharply declined since March, Belgium has quickly become the third largest buyer of Treasury bonds, just behind China and Japan, purchasing more than $200 billion in securities in the past five months, adding to a total stash of around $340 billion. This development is rather bewildering, primarily because Belgium’s GDP as of 2012 was a miniscule $483 billion, meaning, Belgium has spent nearly the entirety of its yearly GDP on our debt.</p>
<p>Clearly, this is impossible, and someone, somewhere, is using Belgium as a proxy in order to prop up the U.S. But who?</p>
<p>Recently, a company based in Belgium called Euroclear has come forward claiming to be the culprit behind the massive purchases of American debt. Euroclear, though, is not a direct buyer. Instead, the bank is a facilitator, using what it calls a “collateral highway” to allow central banks and international banks to move vast amounts of securities <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.world-exchanges.org/news-views/euroclear%E2%80%99s-global-%E2%80%9Ccollateral-highway%E2%80%9D-boost-collateral-flows" target="_blank">around the world</a> faster than ever before.</p>
<p>Euroclear claims to be an administrator for more than $24 trillion in worldwide assets and transactions, but these transactions are not initiated by the company itself. Euroclear is a middleman used by our secret buyer to quickly move U.S. Treasuries into various accounts without ever being identified. So the question remains, who is the true buyer?</p>
<p>My investigation into Euroclear found some interesting facts. Euroclear has financial relationships with more than 90 percent of the world’s central banks and was once partly owned and run by 120 of the largest financial institutions back when it was called the “Euroclear System”. The organization was consolidated and operated by none other than JP Morgan Bank in 1972. In 2000, Euroclear was officially incorporated and became its own entity. However, one must remember, once a JP Morgan bank, <a style="color: #006699;" href="https://www.euroclear.com/en/about/Our-history.html" target="_blank"><em>always</em> a JP Morgan bank.</a></p>
<p>Another interesting fact – Euroclear also has <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.sberbank-cib.ru/eng/about/news/Sberbank_CIB_in_press/index.wbp?number=1373">a strong relationship with the Russian government </a>and is a primary broker for Russian debt to foreign investors. This once again proves my ongoing point that Russia is tied to the global banking cabal as much as the United States. The East vs. West paradigm is a sham of the highest order.</p>
<p>Euroclear’s ties to the banking elite are obvious; however, we are still no closer to discovering the specific groups or institution responsible for buying up U.S. debt. I think that the use of Euroclear and Belgium may be a key in understanding this mystery.</p>
<p>Belgium is the political center of the EU, with more politicians, diplomats and lobbyists than Washington D.C. It is also, despite its size and economic weakness, a member of an exclusive economic club called the <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.bis.org/list/g10publications/index.htm" target="_blank">“Group Of Ten”</a> (G10).</p>
<p>The G10 nations have all agreed to participate in a “General Arrangement to Borrow” (GAB) launched in 1962 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The GAB is designed as an ever cycling fund which members pay into. In times of emergency, members can ask the IMF’s permission for a release of funds. If the IMF agrees, it then injects capital through Treasury purchases and SDR allocations. Essentially, the IMF takes our money, then gives it back to us in times of desperation (with strings attached).  A similar program called &#8216;New Arrangements To Borrow&#8217; (NAB) involves 38 member countries.  This fund was boosted to approximately 370 billion SDR (or $575 billion dollars U.S.) as the derivatives crisis struck markets in 2008-2009.  Without a full and independent audit of the IMF, however, it is impossible to know the exact funds it has at its disposal, or how many SDR&#8217;s it has created.</p>
<p>It should be noted the Bank of International Settlements is also an overseer of the G10. If you want to learn more about the darker nature of globalist groups like the IMF and the BIS, read my articles, <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2074-russia-is-dominated-by-global-banks-too"><em>Russia Is Dominated By Global Banks, Too</em></a>, and <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2126-false-eastwest-paradigm-hides-the-rise-of-global-currency"><em>False East/West Paradigm Hides The Rise Of Global Currency</em>.</a></p>
<p>The following article from <em>Harpers</em> titled <em>“</em>Ruling The World Of Money,” was published in 1983 and boasts about the secrecy and “ingenuity” of the Bank Of International Settlements, an unaccountable body of financiers that dominates the <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.sharelynx.com/papers/BISRTWOM.php" target="_blank">very course of economic life</a> around the world.</p>
<p>It is my belief that Belgium, as a member of the G10 and the GAB/NAB agreements, is being used as a proxy by the BIS and the IMF to purchase U.S. debt, but at a high price. I believe that the banking elite are hiding behind their middleman, Euroclear, because they do not want their purchases of Treasuries revealed too soon. I believe that the IMF in particular is accumulating U.S. debt to be used later as leverage to absorb the dollar and finalize the rise of their SDR currency basket as the world reserve standard.</p>
<p>Imagine what would happen if all foreign creditors abandoned U.S. debt purchases because the dollar was no longer seen as viable as a world reserve currency.  Imagine that the Fed&#8217;s efforts to stimulate through fiat printing became useless in propping up Treasuries, serving only to devalue the domestic buying power of our currency.  Imagine that the IMF swoops in as the lender of last resort; the only entity willing to service our debt and keep the system running.  Imagine what kind of concessions America would have to make to a global loan shark like the IMF.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, the plan to replace the dollar is not mere &#8220;theory&#8221;.  In fact, IMF head Christine Lagarde <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2011/0214/297662-g20/">has openly called for a &#8220;global financial system&#8221;</a> to take over in the place of the current dollar based system.</p>
<p>The Bretton Woods System, established in 1944, was used by the United Nations and participating governments to form international rules of economic conduct, including fixed rates for currencies and establishing the dollar as the monetary backbone. The IMF was created during this shift towards globalization as the BIS slithered into the background after its business dealings with the Nazis were exposed. It was the G10, backed by the IMF, that then signed the Smithsonian Agreement in 1971 which ended the Bretton Woods system of fixed currencies, as well as any remnants of the gold standard. This led to the floated currency system we have today, as well as the slow poison of monetary inflation which has now destroyed more than 98 percent of the dollar’s purchasing power.</p>
<p>I believe the next and final step in the banker program is to reestablish a new Bretton Woods style system in the wake of an engineered catastrophe. That is to say, we are about to go full circle. Perhaps Ukraine will be the cover event, or tensions in the South China Sea. Just as Bretton Woods was unveiled during World War II, Bretton Woods redux may be unveiled during World War III. In either case, the false East/West paradigm is the most useful ploy the elites have to bring about a controlled decline of the dollar.</p>
<p>The new system will reintroduce the concept of fixed currencies, but this time, all currencies will be fixed or “pegged” to the value of the SDR global basket. The IMF holds a global SDR summit every five years, and the next meeting is set for the beginning of 2015.</p>
<p>If the Chinese yuan is brought into the SDR basket next year, if the BRICS enter into a conjured economic war with the West, and if the dollar is toppled as the world reserve, there will be nothing left in terms of fiscal structure in the way of a global currency system. If the public does not remove the globalist edifice by force, the IMF and the BIS will then achieve their dream – the complete dissolution of economic sovereignty, and the acceptance by the masses of global financial governance. The elites don’t want to hide behind the curtain anymore. They want recognition. They want to be worshiped. And, it all begins with the secret buyout of America, the implosion of our debt markets, and the annihilation of our way of life.</p>

			<h4>Origin of the Master Model</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/modern-slavery.jpg" alt="" />The master plan for world domination we see playing out today was first proposed to the US at the end of World War I. However, there were no takers. People were too war weary. However, when the plan was again proposed at the end of World War II, it was accepted. Consequently, World War II quietly transitioned into the secret “war” to set up what has become known as the “new world order” — an absolute dictatorship over the entire planet.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The United States set up the School of the Americas to train future dictators and terrorists who would be sent out into the world to destroy sovereign nations and place them under US domination by installing puppet governments obedient to the United States. Many conquests were made quietly using clever economic tricks <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote2" name="fn2">[2]</a>. However, leaders who refused to submit quietly would see their entire country reduced to rubble and the land rendered unlivable by uranium dust scattered by US bombs. The message was clear: Submit to the United States or face total destruction.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A social model based upon the assumption that cleverness and power automatically convey the right to take anything desired from those who are less adept and unable to resist is not a sustainable model for harmonious social interactions. However, this is the chosen model. The mantra for this model, “A man’s true worth is measured by the amount of other peoples’ happiness that he can <em>possess </em>and <em>destroy</em>” <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote1" name="fn1">[1]</a>, is essentially a call for a class war between the greedy elite and the innocent masses of the world who simply desire a peaceful existence.</p>
<h4>Acquisitions</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">The United States looks at the rest of the world as a “resource”. If a country has something — oil, gold, minerals, etc. — that the US covets, it believes it has the right to take those things by whatever means necessary. In many cases the coveted resource is human slave labor. Let’s look at some representative examples:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong><a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/US_ThirdWorld/US_Guat.html" target="_blank">Guatemala: The Banana Wars</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">With the cooperation of the dictator, United Fruit Company (US) owned almost half of the country and used the locals as slaves to harvest its Chiquita brand bananas. However, during the period from 1945-1954 new leaders made changes. They helped the poor and set up social security and health care. Then they took land away from United Fruit and gave it to the local people. United fruit complained to the CIA that its business interests were being interfered with by the “communist” government. Any government which shows kindness to the poor and weak is called communist by the US. The US attacked Guatemala — killed the elected leaders and many thousands of citizens — and established a puppet dictatorship which would obey the will of United Fruit. The people were returned to a state of slavery. The CIA trained death squads to make sure the people were crushed into submission.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Strip Mining in Africa <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote4" name="fn4">[4]</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In Africa, the International Monetary Fund — a puppet of the US — destroys a country with strip mining. The original country was self sustaining. People were able to grow lots of food and hunt animals. However, once the land was ruined by US corporations, it was unusable to plant crops and the native animals died. The people had to buy food from other countries with money loaned to them by the IMF which they could never hope to repay. Therefore, a once free and self supporting people were made debt slaves of the IMF. Once all the natural resources have been stolen, the corporations will simply pack up and leave the indigenous people to starve and die.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Countries Used as Trash Dumps <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote5" name="fn5">[5]</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Used computers and associated items are dumped in poor countries where starving barefoot children sift through the mess of hazardous waste and broken obsolete glass computer monitors hoping to find something they can sell to get enough money to stay alive another day. Property stickers show the waste is mainly from the US government and various US state governments.</p>
<h4>Corruption of Trusted Sources</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Reporters and News Organizations</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The masses are conditioned to believe news they receive from establishment sources. In the earlier times, this assumption was often correct. It was considered so important by the founding fathers that freedom of the press was enshrined in the US constitution. However, times have changed.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Walter Cronkite was known as the “trusted voice”. No one knew he was also the official announcer at the secret Bohemian Grove meetings. The leaders of the world’s news organizations also attend this event. That is why, even though the meetings began over one hundred years ago, until recently no one knew this group even existed. President George W. Bush may have set a new record for bribing journalists to allow their trusted name to be used as the author of material actually written by government propaganda experts. Apparently, everyone has a price and the government, of course, has no problem when it comes to money.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">When Ronald Reagan reportedly ordered the death of investigative reporter Jessica Savitch <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote6" name="fn6">[6]</a>, the message to independent journalists was clear: Go against the official party line an you’re done!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Today, dedicated journalists face mysterious deaths and strange single car accidents but a few survive long enough to give us a glimpse of truths we would otherwise never know. They are true heroes.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Churches</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Churches are everywhere. Unfortunately, legitimate Spiritual teachers are not. People look at churches either as harmless or with some sort of conditioned hypnotic respect. Churches send out “missionaries”. However, the “mission” of these missionaries may not be so clear. If you wanted to infiltrate a foreign country, these people would be an ideal asset.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Churches are not Spiritual centers. At best, all they want is your money. At worst, they are Satanic and you are in severe Spiritual danger if you come under their influence and control.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Catholic Church has been a trusted asset of the US intelligence community for quite some time. Significant information obtained by priests during confessions is routinely passed on to the government.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This agreement predates the internet by many years. Because the church has branches in almost every country, it has great potential for covert activities. For example, if you need to get an operative who is in danger out of a country, they can go to a Catholic church for “confession”. Once the door is closed, they can exit through a secret passage, be disguised in robes and spirited safely out of the country. Church secrecy is at least on a par with US secrecy. Also, the Catholic church and the US shadow government share the same Satanic value system and engage in child rape and ritual killings.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Doctors and the Medical Industry</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Medicine in the United States is an industry. It is no longer a profession. Its corporate model puts profit above all else. If some patients accidentally benefit they are the lucky ones.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The medical community has a rigid hierarchical structure and effective mechanisms for enforcing secrecy. Essentially, its model closely resembles the military chain of command structure. This makes it a perfect partner for the government in the area of secret human experiments.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For example, when the government was doing radiation experiments on humans, a doctor or someone dressed as a doctor would just walk up to unsuspecting patients and inject them with radioactive material. They were then secretly followed for years to see what would happen. Eventually, some of those who survived were told the truth. Most people used in the MK Ultra and subsequent secret projects were never notified.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Hospitals are set up to protect themselves. Staff may appear to be dedicated, smiling people who truly care about you. However, they are basically prostitutes who are being nice because you are worth money to them. When they make mistakes they have a “loss prevention” department staffed by clever lawyers who are trained to protect the financial interests of the hospital by denying everything and fabricating believable coverups. They are trained to do whatever is necessary. The staff will all agree to support whatever lies are needed. They know their job and their financial future depends upon maintaining strict secrecy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The only people who receive legitimate medical care are the select elite cleared to access<a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/top-secret-medicine/" target="_blank">top secret medicine</a>. These people always get excellent care because the doctors work for the shadow government and mistakes on their part are simply not tolerated.</p>
<h4>Infiltrations</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Countries which have the resources to sustain an intelligence community generally try to get operatives (spies) into other countries so they can directly observe activities. When real people gather intelligence, this is called <em>human intelligence </em>or HUMINT. The US, of course, does this too. However, you may not be aware of the extent to which the US also infiltrates itself. The central government really does not trust anyone.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Essentially all local police departments, state offices and state governors have a covert federal agent working close by pretending to be just another employee. Also, every US neighborhood has an informer who reports to the federal government. Large corporations, which tend to behave like “mini governments”, need to be infiltrated and kept under observation. Colleges and universities are also monitored.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Here is how this spy network operates: The NSA likes to recruit young kids right out of college. When they are hired and sworn to secrecy they still do not know what their assignment will be. They must agree to do this assignment without first being told what it is.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Some agents, like John Perkins <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote2" name="fn2">[2]</a>, are assigned to work in other countries. However, others are assigned to work inside the US. Their assignment could be to go to some state and apply to join the local police department. They would pretend to be just a regular person looking for a job. They would take the necessary training and spend their life as a local policeman so they could directly observe other local police from the inside and report to the NSA. Since they are actually an employee of the NSA, presumably they get to keep both salaries and, eventually, both retirements. All significant local police forces in the US are infiltrated this way.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Additionally, some agents will be assigned to get a job on the state governor’s staff as well as in major local state agencies. A CIA or NSA agent is always on the staff at major colleges and universities. The same goes for major corporations.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Senior level agents are allowed to have special TV receivers in their homes linked to the secret government TV network. This way everyone stays on the same page. The channels on this network actually broadcast the truth. TV channels available to ordinary people contain only government approved propaganda mixed with “bread and circuses” presentations to make sure the <em>sheeple </em>stay asleep and content.</p>
<h4>Fronts</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">The US government is involved in illegal activities internationally and domestically. If it performed these activities overtly in the name of the United States, there would be serious consequences under both international and local laws. To avoid this situation, the US government operates thousands of “front organizations” which appear to be private but are actually shadow operatives of the US.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For example, John Perkins <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote2" name="fn2">[2]</a> explained that he was recruited, hired and trained by the NSA. He was an NSA agent. However, for his cover as an <em>economic hit man</em>, he “officially” worked for a “private” company called Charles T. Main. This company was a government front to shield the US because the activities the NSA trained Perkins to do were illegal.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is standard operating procedure for the US as well as other countries and many corporations. It shields them from legal recourse by providing deniability for the crimes they actually direct and commit.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Generally, when the US wants to influence other sovereign countries, it creates harmless looking NGO’s which appear to be independent but are actually fronts for covert activities.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Domestically, colleges and universities — especially those with associated medical schools and hospitals — are great places to conceal a variety of covert projects such as the MK Ultra series of human experiments which, reportedly, continue today using new cover names. The US also likes to create non-profit corporations which exist only to provide classified services to the United States. A good example would be the Institutes for Defense Analysis (IDA). The US, reportedly, is its only client.</p>
<h4>Programming</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Mass media “programming” is actually programming you. It has developed into a subtle form of mind control. Before radio and television, special interests recognized that motion pictures could be used to alter public opinion in their favor. Perhaps, for example, you wanted to attack labor unions. When radio and later television came along providing access to national and international audiences, the temptation to exploit these technologies became irresistible. Originally, the US government recognized this and set up fairness rules to prevent monopolies from taking over the broadcast media and blocking opposing viewpoints. All this ended, unfortunately, when Ronald Regan canceled all the fairness regulations. Today, a handful of powerful corporations own and control essentially all content delivered by radio and television.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Television is the main vehicle for mass indoctrination. It is said that people watching TV actually fall into a light hypnotic trance. The “entertainment” you see on TV does not “just happen to be there”. It is very carefully planned and timed to attract and influence targeted audiences. It is said that if some event were to somehow shut down all television broadcasts the government would experience a severe crisis because it would lose control over the minds of the masses.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">TV creates sort of a “hive mind” among the masses and keeps everyone coordinated and tuned into the official party line. Without this, people would have no choice but to start thinking for themselves and forming independent opinions. Clearly, this would be a disaster.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The radio broadcast of “War of the Worlds” and the later movie “The Day the Earth Stood Still” are said to be CIA psychological experiments to judge how the general public would react to some type of ET contact.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Today, broadcasting is not just a one way event. Because people react to events and use social media to express these reactions, the effect of specific propaganda can be analyzed in real time. Since the government now intercepts all electronic communications, it is able to see general opinions and then tweak algorithms to maximize the desired effect of propaganda. This ability makes TV a two-way communications system although most people, of course, do not realize this and have no concept of the level of sophistication these technologies have reached.</p>
<h4>Information Theory</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Information Theory is the name of a relatively new branch of science which became popular in the 1960′s. It covers a broad range of technologies. Basically, it is the science of the flow of information and how that flow can be selectively controlled so that information flows only in desired pathways. As you may have already guessed, governments love this sort of stuff.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>ECM</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">ECM stands for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">El</span>ectronic <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Co</span>unter <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Me</span>asures. In general, these are techniques to disable other electronic devices. Basically, it is electronic warfare. When the secret service is active in an area, for example, they will selectively jam all radio frequencies except for the specific frequencies they are using so that no one else can communicate.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">World leaders, who are generally terrified of “threats” materializing from practically anywhere, like to travel with ECM generators running just in case “someone” from “somewhere” was trying to target them for “some reason”. Basically, they are paranoid whack jobs.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">People familiar with aviation tell the story of how Tony Blair, while traveling to or near a commercial airport, reportedly caused a commercial jet to crash because all the ECM garbage he was transmitting jammed the plane’s navigation system. Of course, the British government would never admit this.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Secure Communication With Submarines</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7754" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/standard-procedure-1.jpg" alt="" width="273" height="315" />Since submarines were invented, communicating with them has been a problem because conventional radio waves will not travel underwater. Therefore, early submarines had to get close enough to the surface to put up some kind of antenna in the air to send or receive radio messages. Obviously, this could pose a problem if you did not wish to be discovered and located. After all, the motivation to create submarines in the first place was the feeling that they would be able to move about the planet secretly. However, newer technologies now make this impossible.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">To solve the problem of reliable secure communication without the need to surface, scientists learned that sea water was essentially transparent to a special type of Argon laser. To set up the current communications network, it was decided to use several satellites with each satellite sending only part of an encrypted communication signal. The complete signal could only be received at a specific point underwater where all the laser beams intersected. Intercepting only one or two beams would prove useless. This communications system is considered to be impossible to intercept.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Quantum Entanglement</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Returning to the submarine issue for a moment, before modern communications were perfected, there was a search for some reliable method to send a signal to a submerged submarine that could not be detected. This was considered necessary in a war situation to secretly transmit an attack command. What they originally did was to locate a couple of people who could communicate telepathically. One would be at the command base and the other on the submarine. Doing a bit more research, it was determined that this type of communication is instantaneous and somehow operated outside of time. Radio waves travel at the speed of light.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Quantum entanglement is a process which uses technology to send and receive signals outside of space-time. Now, why would you possibly want to do this? Well, if you had a base or a colony on a planet in some other solar system light years away, you would not want to wait years for messages to be received. Following this thread — and adding some basic common sense — why would you want to dedicate resources to search for habitable planets in distant solar systems when you had already “proven” it would be impossible to ever get there? Could it just be that someone is not coming clean with whole story?</p>
<h4>The Separation Barrier</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is a model of the separation barrier which insulates the ruling class from the slave class. It is essentially “intellectual apartheid”. The question is, why is it there. It takes considerable effort, money and manpower to maintain this artificial barrier. What is the reasoning behind not having a level playing field for everyone? Why does this idea absolutely terrify the elite? What are they afraid of?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Pirate Story</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is a summary of a story told years ago on a radio broadcast most likely by Paul Harvey:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ordinary people were afraid. The Earth was flat so they dare not venture far from home. Periodically, a pirate ship would come. They did not know how it got there or from where it came. It brought treasures they had never seen. The Chief Pirate would encourage the young men to study and specialize in specific skills. He wanted them to become educated but only in one narrow area. The Chief Pirate knew the world was not flat and how to navigate to other lands. However, this knowledge was never discussed. This “top secret” knowledge or the “big picture of the known world” would only be given to the Chief Pirate’s son who would inherit his title and someday become the Chief Pirate.</p></blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;">This story is about the origin of the concept we call <em>compartmentalization</em> — the process of controlling the slave masses by only allowing them to know specific bits of the truth while the leaders are allowed to know total truth.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">Leaders can only maintain their status if there are slaves. Otherwise, everyone would be equal and operate on a level playing field. This means “leaders” would have to pull their own weight like everyone else. Clearly, this would be intolerable. Leaders love beautiful and exotic things but don’t want to do the work needed to create these things. They probably could not even plant a garden much less build the various “ivory towers” where they like to live surrounded by servants. If left on their own they would very likely starve. This is why it is so important to create and maintain the complex separation barrier.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Why don’t people who live above the separation barrier ever “come down” and talk to the people below the barrier? Well, other than the obvious fact that they would likely be killed or jailed for espionage or treason, there is another, simpler, reason.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Would you like to spend your days sitting in an open field with kindergarten kids looking for four leaf clovers? Probably not. You have progressed beyond that. The slaves below the separation barrier cannot even imagine the world of those who live above the barrier. In fact, the elite do not even consider the slaves human. They call them “disposable biological units”. The United Nations prefers the slang term “the herd”. Slaves can be easily bred in quantities needed and programmed to do desired tasks. Then, they can be easily disposed of when no longer useful. That’s how they look at you. So, why would they want to make friends with you?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Mars Example</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There is an interesting event playing out today that you may have noticed. This concerns the recruitment and selection of people to be sent to Mars. There are simulation projects where volunteers are locked away to imitate the long voyage to Mars. They are being told that this is a one way trip and they can never hope to return to Earth.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">What you are witnessing is the selection process for the “seed people” who will be used to breed the future slave class on Mars. In a situation similar to the period when most believed the Earth was flat and you would fall off if you tried to go to sea, these people are convinced that the only way to get to mars is to ride a rocket on a perilous journey taking years. Because they truly believe this, when they get to Mars, they will teach this crap to their kids along with other misconceptions like it is impossible to go faster than the speed of light and other associated obsolete scientific principles. They will have no<br />
desire to ever return to Earth or go anywhere else because they truly believe it is not possible. They will be contented slaves.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course the truth is that there are already secret colonies on Mars. It is not that hard to get there using antigravity and other secret propulsion methods and it is quite likely possible to simply walk through some kind of wormhole device and come out on Mars.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">However, the slaves will never know this. Just as it is done on Earth, there will be an artificial separation barrier. The insiders will know the truth and will be physically hidden from the slaves. There will be secret police and other methods — the same as are used on Earth — to make sure no slave ever escapes from the “information prison”. Business as usual will continue.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Reinforcement of Ignorance</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Governments and their oligarchs love to keep their subjects in a cloud of ignorance. Back in the days when people believed the Earth was flat, the inner circle ruling class knew it was round. Maintaining the deception was convenient because it kept the slaves from developing any desire to travel far from home.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Nothing has changed all that much today. Consider, for example, all the fuss over the missing MH370 plane. You are being played for a sucker. It is impossible for that plane to have “disappeared”.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The US DoD spy satellite system reportedly consists of ten constellations of satellites. Each constellation has over seven thousand satellites. They see and record everything that happens on this planet. The floor of the oceans can be seen just as clearly as the land areas. The resolution of the system is better than one square millimeter. Also, everything is recorded so you can go back in time and play past images.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7756" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/standard-procedure-2.jpg" alt="" width="141" height="141" />This is a picture of a common electric lamp. Take this lamp and throw it in the ocean — any ocean anywhere on this planet. The spy satellite system will locate it, give you the coordinates and give you a photo at least as good as the one above. That is the capability of the system. So, clearly, it is impossible not to know the location of something as large as a Boeing 777 plane. All the TV publicity is a choreographed play. You are being scammed and you need to wake up and realize this fact.</p>
<h4>Murders and Assassinations</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">To ensure a strong empire, dissent must be crushed. The United States trains assassins and carries out both domestic and foreign murders and assassinations on a regular basis. You may be familiar with the classic movie scenes where a black limousine with tinted windows drives by a target with thugs shooting machine guns. Although this would accomplish the task, it is a bit too obvious in a country that advertises itself to be a free, civilized democracy. Someone might catch on and begin to doubt the party line. Consequently, these things must be done quietly.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Inside the US, murders are reportedly carried out by a group known as “FBI Division Five”. Other agencies likely have the responsibility for foreign assassinations. However, the basic techniques used would be similar.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Typically, an agent would wake up every day and connect to the top secret internet to see who he was assigned to kill that day. There would be several options. If it was important to eliminate the target immediately, a fast acting chemical agent would be selected which, for example, would cause the target to die within a few hours of a “natural” heart attack.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">However, if time was not critical and the government just wanted the target out of the way, you might want to select one of the cancer causing agents such as those likely used to eliminate Hugo Chavez and Senator Ted Kennedy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There is also a third possibility. This involves character assassination instead of actual murder. Consider, for example, a person who has gained a lot of public recognition talking about, say, free energy. If you simply kill the person, there could be blowback and talk that he was silenced by the government. In such cases, it is easier to use a chemical agent designed not to kill but, rather, to cause states of mental confusion resulting in obviously strange behavior. This would be coordinated with the government controlled mainstream press to make sure everyone became convinced the person was a nut and would therefore ignore anything said without regard to the truth or validity of the message.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Once the appropriate chemical has been selected, you need to load it into the secret delivery system and locate your target. To find your target you will connect to the top secret internet and pinpoint the location of the target through their cell phone. You can also activate all the cameras and microphones in electronic gadgets connected to the internet associated with the target in case you wish to look around the target’s home and hear in real time what is taking place.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, this will not help you locate the target when it is time to actually do the hit. So, you need to get the top secret profile data which will show any predictable habits of the target. Everyone is constantly tracked through their cell phones and profiles are logged and stored. In this case, the profile shows that the target has a favorite restaurant and goes there for lunch every day around 11:30. Now, you know exactly what to do. You go to the restaurant, hang out until you see your target, and get in line behind the target. Now, all you need to do is slightly bump into the target to deliver the chemical. Generally, the targets never even notice.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This mission is now complete. If it is early enough, you can check back in to the top secret system to see who you are supposed to kill next. Just another day. Just a routine job.</p>
<h4>Money</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;"><em>Money</em> is an imaginary force. It is used to motivate and control slaves. Real forces effect all life forms. However, only people respond to money. The only reason they do is because they have been artificially programmed to do so.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Money can be created in unlimited quantities by those adept in the use of this force. The physical world is finite, however the world of imagination is not. There is no limit to the quantity of money that can be imagined into existence. Money can also be imagined out of existence.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Let’s assume that one day the entire financial system simply disappeared. If you lived in a rural area and had a nice veggie garden, some friendly chickens, collection facilities for rain water and a few photocells for electricity, you would not notice this. The veggies would continue to grow. Rain would periodically fall. The chickens would lay eggs as usual. The sun would continue to shine. However, if you lived in a city environment, you would be devastated.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Before money, people lived in small hunter-gatherer groups. The concept of ownership did not exist. People worked and survived as a group. Men and women were equal. Everyone contributed to the community. Resources were shared equally. The concept of “mine” and “yours” did not exist. Women generally became pregnant only once about every three years although there was no birth control. Later, when the concept of money entered the consciousness, women were seen as having less value because men were paid for work but women were not paid to raise and care for kids. Society has changed, however, the downgraded status of women has not.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Money systems have always been manipulated by clever people. When gold was used as money, people learned they could dilute pure gold with silver or maybe even lead to come up with something that looked like pure gold and had the correct weight but was a fraud. A king suspected he was being scammed but had no way to prove it. He called on the great minds of the time for help. This led to what is known as the <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://faculty.weber.edu/ewalker/Chem2990/Chem%202990%20Specific%20Gravity%20Readings.pdf" target="_blank">Archimedes’ principle</a> which is better known today as “specific gravity”. This principle made it possible to compare a sample known to be pure gold to a questionable sample and prove the unknown sample was not pure gold. Likely, some clever crook lost his head once this test became known.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There is a general belief that gold is the ultimate reference for all money. However, secrets concerning the exact quantity of gold make this a perilous assumption. Reportedly, the United States stole a tremendous quantity of physical gold from Japan towards the end of World War II. This gold exists off the books. To make matters worse, Japan was not all that concerned. Japan had been using gold bars as ballast on its ships because they were compact and heavy. They thought nothing of throwing the bars overboard as necessary. Japan used platinum as a money reference and the US never got that. This should make one rethink all the hype about the value of gold. It may be a lot more plentiful than we have been led to believe. Also, the secret off the books stashes of gold would allow its relative value to be manipulated at will just like other commodity markets.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Financial Axis of Evil <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote3" name="fn3">[3]</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7755" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/standard-procedure-3.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="231" />This is the model of the financial axis of evil which rules this planet. It consists of three main branches as shown above. Collectively, they are known as “The Empire of the City”. Briefly, here is how this system operates:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The London financial district is in London, Washington D.C. is in the United States and the Vatican is in Italy. However, these three places are not part of the countries where they exist. They are independent “city states” and have their own laws and constitution. They are, effectively, “mini countries” inside of other countries and fly their own flags. The city state of London is a private corporation and pays no taxes to actual London or to Britain. The city state of London is the master power center and is controlled by the <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.iamthewitness.com/DarylBradfordSmith_Rothschild.htm" target="_blank">Rothschild family</a> which considers itself to be the legal owner of this planet. The Vatican is the largest private land owner in the world and the first true multinational corporation with installations (churches) and secret agents (The Knights of Malta) everywhere. They control through the power of fear of the unknown and practice black magic. Washington D.C. relies upon brute military force. All three closely cooperate combining their specialties of financial trickery, witchcraft and military might. Of course, all three worship Satan as their Master.</p>
<h4>Slavery</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Slavery is alive and well throughout the world. The US constitution prohibits slavery, however, most americans live in slave-like conditions.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It is said that it will take the average college student until age fifty to pay back their student loan.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The constitutional amendment prohibiting slavery addressed the concept of physically owning another person. However, it did not address the issue of holding another person in bondage as a debt slave. It also did not consider the concept of private for profit prisons who force inmates to work as slaves. These systems exist today and are perfectly legal.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Actually, a recent report from prestigious Princeton University has reclassified the US government as an oligarchy — a country run by and for the rich elite. Former US President Carter has stated that the United States “no longer has a functioning democracy”. So much for the Founding Father’s dream. Speaking of dreams, check out the free you tube video titled “The American Dream”.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Other forms of slavery are illegal but still flourish. Sex slaves are always in demand. Traffickers are sometimes caught but you need to realize that your leaders use sex slaves and also routinely abuse young girls and boys. Sometimes they are also killed during occult rituals. No one ever talks about this and these people are never punished. This has been the normal way of life for Satan worshipers for many years and nothing has changed or is likely to ever change in the future. Stanley Kubrick’s last movie, <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em>, covers this subject. Some believe this intense dramatization of how the elite really live may have cost him his life.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">People still have some rights left in the United States but other countries are a different story. Qatar is doing construction for the World Cup. The event is not scheduled until the year 2022, however they have <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/2022-world-cup-qatar-accused-3303458" target="_blank">already killed 1200 slaves</a> <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote7" name="fn7">[7]</a> by working them to death. People are lured from poor countries with the promise of jobs and money. When they arrive, their passports are confiscated and they are forced to work until they literally drop dead. If the World Cup is actually held in Qatar in 2022, there will be glamorous TV coverage and no one will remember or care about all the dead slaves. The show must go on.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Qatar, incidentally, sponsors Al Jazeera TV network.</p>
<h4>Adaptation Techniques</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">The status quo of today will never change because the people who created it will never die. Because of <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/top-secret-medicine/" target="_blank">top secret medicine</a>, when men like Henry Kissinger, who heads the Bilderberg Group’s steering committee, get too feeble to function, they will simply go to one of the secret locations and use the temporal reversal device to regress back to about twenty years old. Their memories will be unaffected. Then they will get new identities and continue on. This process can be repeated indefinitely.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Because you can never change the status quo, your best hope for a lifetime of reasonable quality is to find clever ways to live in this world with as much independence as possible.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">One method of adaptation is autonomous and semi-autonomous communities. If the community is registered as a religious institution it is automatically shielded from most government interference by the US constitution. It pays no taxes and can pretty much write its own rules by simply calling whatever it wants to do “religious doctrine”. Many small semi-autonomous groups exist where people who share a common set of values find ways to quietly live out their lives pretty much on their own terms. The government does not seem interested in bothering these smaller groups as long as they live peacefully and are not doing anything that the government perceives to be a threat.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Amish people are a good example of an autonomous group. You would probably not want to live as they do, however, before you completely dismiss them, you may want to look at some definite advantages in their chosen lifestyle.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Remember, these are the people who reject technology. They just might have made the correct choice. Technology, at first, seemed like a good idea. However, now that people are addicted to technology they are also enslaved by technology. Everything they do is monitored and recorded by the government. Privacy no longer exists. It did not have to be this way.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Technology, in itself, is not evil. However, it can be quite evil if you live under a government run by sociopathic control freaks which, unfortunately, you do. In the Amish world, electronic surveillance does not exist because electronic devices do not exist. The constant propaganda from TV has no effect on people who do not have TV. A horse does not report its position to a GPS satellite and is not controlled by a computer.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Also, the people are generally healthy and do not suffer from many diseases common to the mainstream population. They are not being poisoned by fluorinated water or additives found in processed food because they don’t use these things. Also, they get lots of physical exercise.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Without totally withdrawing from the world, there are some positive steps you can take. By now you know never to drink fluorinated water or use any personal product containing fluoride such as many brands of toothpaste. To minimize harmful food additives, look for Kosher food which is marked with either the encircled “K” or “U” (Ultra Kosher). These foods have less or no harmful additives. The Jewish community is very protective of its people and the Mossad is widely considered to be the best intelligence service in the world. Therefore, they would have the inside scoop on everything including food and do not want to see their people harmed.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Whatever you decide to do, you definitely do not want to be part of so called mainstream society. These people are doomed. They are sheep (<em>sheeple</em>) slowly walking to the slaughter house. Don’t go there!</p>

<p><strong><em>The very idea that the individual has a natural-born right to his privacy and basic freedoms flies in the face of the collectivist ideal.</em></strong></p>
<p>Government is all about control.</p>
<p>Every government, over time, increases its level of control over its population in every way it can. Given enough time, any government will nibble away at its people’s freedoms until it reaches the point that the people have so little freedom left that the government feels safe in taking the remaining freedoms in ever-larger gulps. Some nations are taking very large gulps indeed.</p>
<p>One of the primary freedoms is privacy. Under the <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/uk00000_.html" target="_blank">British Constitution</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks</em><em>.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Further,</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The common law allows people to speak and act in their own homes as they please and to carry on their daily business, provided that they do not infringe the rights of others or commit an offence.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds downright libertarian, does it not? And it should, as the people who originally collected the bits and pieces that make up the British Constitution were those who, having had enough of the vague and often draconian edicts of various governments, sought to define the rights of the British citizen once and for all.</p>
<p>Of course, “once and for all” did not last very long. Subsequent governments have done their best to slowly erode the basic rights of the British people.</p>
<p>This is consistent with the governments of the world in general.</p>
<p>If we look across the pond to the US, we find in their Bill of Rights, the rights to privacy in numerous amendments, particularly the Fourth Amendment, which states,</p>
<blockquote><p>“<em>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>There can be little doubt that the political leaders of the UK and the US (and, let’s be fair, most of the world’s governments) have violated the basic right to privacy as often as they have been able.</p>
<p>In this, they generally stick together. Typically, international leaders offer no objection to other leaders (either their immediate political opponents or the leaders of other countries) infringing upon the privacy of their citizenries, no matter how extreme the intrusion. They do, however object quite strongly when they find that they themselves have had their own privacy infringed, such as Angela Merkel and Dilma Rousseff have, recently, after finding that the US was tapping their phones.</p>
<p>So, when the authors of the most central principles upon which the present-day UK and the US were founded, crafted their phrasings, what did they mean when they described such essential privacies as “daily business” and “papers and effects”?</p>
<h4>Financial Privacy</h4>
<p>Well, top of the list would surely be financial records, as, historically, these are considered to warrant greater privacy than most any other daily business, papers, and effects.</p>
<p>Yet, today, we are seeing ever-greater intrusion into our earnings, our investments, our savings, and the storage of our wealth. Much of the world—particularly under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (read: International Ministry for Intrusion into Financial Privacy)—is doing all it can to eliminate any and all barriers to its pursuit of personal financial information.</p>
<p>However, the prize for <em>Most Invasive Act of Privacy Destruction </em>must go to the US, whose Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) literally seeks to force financial institutions<em>in other countries</em> to turn over their records to the US.</p>
<p>And much of the world has caved in to this act. So, how is it that this has even been possible, given the fact that it blatantly opposes the founding principles of the US? Well, in a word: marketing.</p>
<p>(Editor’s Note: Be sure to check out: <a href="http://www.internationalman.com/im-forum/7-Asset-Diversification/19523-fatca-watch-list-of-countries-that-signed-agreements-and-those-that-will-not-comply-us-dictates" target="_blank"><em>FATCA Watch: List of Countries That Signed Agreements and Those That Will Not Comply with US Dictates</em></a>.)</p>
<h4>Banking Secrecy</h4>
<p>The OECD countries have done a bang-up job in recent years in attacking the very concept of financial privacy by referring to it by a similar but more sinister term: “secrecy.”</p>
<p>Secrecy, of course, implies that something rather underhanded is taking place and needs routing out. And the world’s low-tax jurisdictions do commit the unforgiveable sin of maintaining the principle that the depositor is <em>entitled </em>to privacy.</p>
<p>In each of these jurisdictions, it is the norm for the average banker to feel that a client’s account is nobody’s bloody business but his own. Whilst they can be quite vehement in this belief, it is also true that they are labouring under increasing pressure from the OECD (and now, FATCA) to compromise the privacy of their clients.</p>
<p>And, in doing so, the OECD has gained quite a following in the form of the media and the average person, as the very term “banking secrecy” now tends to falsely imply criminal acts. This is interesting, as the average person <em>does</em> still believe in privacy. He believes firmly that it is his right to maintain privacy in his bedroom or a public loo, or to draw the drapes in his living room in the evening. Yet these same people have been programmed to mentally remove financial privacy from other privacies.</p>
<p>Clearly, the OECD is going to continue in its intention to convince the world that the individual (unless he holds political office) has an <em>obligation</em> to relinquish his privacy with regard to his financial dealings. And, along the way, its marketing programme will succeed, through endless repetition, of convincing <em>boobus humanus</em> that this is altogether correct.</p>
<p>This suggests that the reader should simply give up and allow his government to invade his privacy at will. However, as those of us who are firm believers in internationalisation often comment, <em>“There is no perfect jurisdiction; there are only jurisdictions that may be more favourable than the home jurisdiction.”</em></p>
<p>As Doug Casey outlined in his visionary book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932496091/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0932496091&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=interman019-20" target="_blank"><em>The International Man</em></a>, in 1978, the concept of internationalising is not simply to pick up stakes and move to another country. Rather, it is the concept of “planting flags.” Investigate possible countries in which to live, to hold citizenship, to invest, in which to gain an income, and plant flags in each. Live in one, become a citizen in another, bank in a third, etc.</p>
<p>Some countries still do believe that it is your <em>right</em> to maintain financial privacy and, whilst they may feel pressure from your home country, they are more likely to do all they can to protect your privacy.</p>
<p>As in other concerns, there is no ideal country, but there are those that are decidedly<em>better</em>, where the term <em>privacy</em> still retains its original meaning and individual privacy is still respected.</p>

<p>Going offline or off the grid is not easy for everyone. Modern society has come to repudiate the very elements that make civilization possible. Living in cyber space is existence on life support at best. Until now, people had idiosyncratic relations, with intimate experiences and personal memories. Thoughts were internal and private conduct was confidential. Under a hi-tech environment, the system moves closer to an all knowing eye. But what happens, when the public becomes enlightened to the bondage of the tech prison, thanks to all the whistleblowers?</p>
<p>The irony befits the hypocrite techie class of privacy violators. Lamenting that their fiefdom of intrusive surveillance and data mining might be compromised, the high priests of SPY, Inc. are flustered. With the disclosure of a synergistic relationship of an <a href="http://click.thesaurus.com/click/nn1ov4?clkord=13&amp;clkpage=the&amp;clksite=thes&amp;clkld=0&amp;clkdest=http%3A%2F%2Fthesaurus.com%2Fbrowse%2Fintertwined">intertwined</a> nature, the high-tech prophets lay exposed. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-26/nsa-spying-risks-35-billion-in-u-s-technology-sales.html">NSA Spying Risks $35 Billion in U.S. Technology Sales</a> has the flagship government front companies in full damage control.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;News about U.S. surveillance disclosed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden has &#8220;the great potential for doing serious damage to the competitiveness&#8221; of U.S. companies such as Cupertino, California-based Apple, Facebook Inc., and Microsoft Corp., Richard Salgado, Google’s director for law enforcement and information security, told a U.S. Senate panel Nov. 13. &#8220;The trust that’s threatened is essential to these businesses.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>With the announcement that <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2083800/facebook-faces-lawsuit-for-allegedly-scanning-private-messages.html">Facebook faces lawsuit for allegedly scanning private messages</a>, the diminutive privacy on this social network just got smaller. &#8220;Facebook was one of the Web Services that was caught scanning URLs despite such activity remaining undisclosed to the user,&#8221; according to the complaint.Can your personal persona remain your own business? What exactly can be attempted to protect your identity and privacy?</p>
<p>Woodrow Hartzog and Evan Selinger propose in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/01/obscurity-a-better-way-to-think-about-your-data-than-privacy/267283/">Obscurity: A Better Way to Think About Your Data Than &#8216;Privacy&#8217;</a>, adding layers of complexity guards against most of the ordinary risks of scrutinized personal data. However, this argument is trite since the cyber world of digital transmission uses the technological routing and coding systems, engineered as part of the total government retrieval society.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Obscurity is the idea that when information is hard to obtain or understand, it is, to some degree, safe. Safety, here, doesn&#8217;t mean inaccessible. Competent and determined data hunters armed with the right tools can always find a way to get it. Less committed folks, however, experience great effort as a deterrent.</p>
<p>Online, obscurity is created through a combination of factors. Being invisible to search engines increases obscurity. So does using privacy settings and pseudonyms. Disclosing information in coded ways that only a limited audience will grasp enhances obscurity, too. Since few online disclosures are truly confidential or highly publicized, the lion&#8217;s share of communication on the social web falls along the expansive continuum of obscurity: a range that runs from completely hidden to totally obvious.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Privacy is a hindrance to corporate marketing, while secrecy is a threat to the national security establishment that observes the basic rule of all technology. Use the optimum scientific hi-tech enhancement to maintain and further the interests of the ruling elites. Any technological development is viewed as a useful advancement if it works to expand control over the economy or social structure.</p>
<p>Supporting this conclusion is an article from the master of facture awareness. Michael Snyder provides an impactful list of <a href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/32-privacy-destroying-technologies-that-are-systematically-transforming-america-into-a-giant-prison">32 Privacy Destroying Technologies That Are Systematically Transforming America Into A Giant Prison</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Many people speak of this as being the &#8220;Information Age&#8221;, but most Americans don’t really stop and think about what that really means. Most of the information that is considered to be so &#8220;valuable&#8221; is actually about all of us. Businesses want to know as much about all of us as possible so that they can sell us stuff. Government officials want to know as much about all of us as possible so that they can make sure that we are not doing anything that they don’t like.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If you need more convincing, examine the <a href="http://www.offthegridnews.com/2013/12/09/10-privacy-destroying-technologies-that-are-turning-america-into-a-police-state/">10 Privacy-Destroying Technologies That Are Turning America Into A Police State</a>, by Daniel Jennings. How many of these devices or practices are monitoring your every move and thought?</p>
<ol>
<li>Electric meters</li>
<li>Telematic devices on cars</li>
<li>Smartphones</li>
<li>RFID chips in drivers’ licenses, credit cards and other cards that allow the tracking of individuals</li>
<li>Data mining by local and federal government</li>
<li>Voice recognition. Russian scientists have invented software called Voice Grid Nation that can identify the voices of millions of different people</li>
<li>Fingerprint recognition</li>
<li>Chips that monitor your body functions</li>
<li>Behavior monitoring software</li>
<li>Next Generation surveillance systems such as Trapwire and Intellistreet</li>
</ol>
<p>Popular consensus would have you believe that this infringement into your most personal behavior is inevitable and it is futile to resist. From an institutional perspective that viewpoint seems correct. Nonetheless, the preservation of your human dignity demands a vigorous reassessment of the numerous ways you have the ability to influence, if not, protect against this tech assault.</p>
<p>Before assuming that tech is great, reflect upon the culture of expected progress. Proponents of applied science automatically assume that advancement comes from such evolution. Conversely, the actual function of various innovations often brings the loss of personal solitude. Tech is not neutral. By definition new or different technology changes the landscape.</p>
<p>What does not change is human nature. Supercharging the velocity and speed of functions and the distribution of information, without guarding the integrity of personal consent is intrinsically immoral. While that statement may seem obsolete as the <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/">NSA</a> constructs the largest digital computer memory center in the history of the world in Utah with the capability of storing 5 zettabytes of data, the principle of inherent autonomy still remains.Amitai Etzioni presents an academic postulation, attempting to answer the question, <a href="http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/26456309/are-new-technologies-enemy-privacy">Are New Technologies the Enemy of Privacy?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Privacy is one good among other goods and should be weighed as such. The relationship between technology and privacy is best viewed as an arms race between advancements that diminish privacy and those that better protect it, rather than the semi-Luddite view which sees technology as one-sided development enabling those who seek to invade privacy to overrun those who seek to protect it. The merits or defects of particular technologies are not inherent to the technologies, but rather, depend on how they are used and above all, on how closely their use is monitored and accounted for by the parties involved. In order to reassure the public and to ensure accountability and oversight, a civilian review board should be created to monitor the government’s use of surveillance and related technologies. Proper accountability requires multiple layers of oversight, and should not be left solely in the hands of the government.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem with this arms race is that it is waged among equally corrupt globalist factions. When Mr. Etzioni asserts &#8220;How they are used&#8221; he interjects the moral imperative. The record of Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, etc. respect and protection of personal confidentially is not exactly reassuring. Their government parent partner agencies in data mining use the telecommunication corporations like Verizon, AT&amp;T and ISP providers as giant sucking machines that feed the secretive intelligence community.Understanding the drill is simple, secrecy resides within the ruling class, while all personal privacy is relegated to the museum of family archives. Just how can such a relationship be monitored by some kind of nebulous civil board to ensure non consensual privacy?</p>
<p>With the overwhelming wherewithal, increasing technological capacities allow, even greater levels of abuse and evil applications. If no other lesson is internalized from the Edward Snowden disclosures, society better admit that trust in the secure use of communication technology is near zero.</p>
<p>When privacy is surrendered so willingly, especially with no consequences for the offending government agencies or complicit corporatist associates, the future of civilized life comes into question. Yet, people are so easily induced to acclimate into using the next wizard device.</p>
<p>Life is a beach no longer. <a href="http://entertainment.time.com/2014/01/02/disney-nsa-style-magic-bands-theme-park/">Now Disney Can Track Your Every Move with NSA-Style Wristbands</a>, is using the &#8220;Magic Bands&#8221; — which are currently optional — are part of a new MyMagic+ &#8220;vacation management system&#8221; that can track guests as they move throughout the park..Efficient? Perhaps. But post-Snowden, some worry that Magic Bands are nothing more than NSA-esque tracking devices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, that voluntary choice lasts only as long as it is offered. This culture of &#8220;personal space&#8221; invasion is meant to indoctrinate the friendly likes into a sleeping death from poison apples. Being buried alive, in a snow job of tech that promises you will be the fairest in the land, will not make you a queen.That prince charming kiss only comes with resisting any snooping gear that diminishes the innate right for privacy. Taking protective measure against technological enslavement is the real national security mandate. The enemy is not some fairy tale monster; just look no further than to your own government. You have the right to your secrets. Dump the smart devices and go as low-tech as possible.</p>

<p><em>Does anyone in authority anywhere tell the truth about Fukushima? If there is any government or non-government authority in the world that is addressing the disaster at Fukushima openly, directly, honestly, and effectively, it’s not apparent to the outside observer what entity that might be.</em></p>
<p>There is instead an apparent global conspiracy of authorities of all sorts to deny to the public reliably accurate, comprehensible, independently verifiable (where possible), and comprehensive information about not only the condition of the Fukushima power plant itself and its surrounding communities, but about the unceasing, uncontrolled release of radioactive debris into the air and water, creating a constantly increasing risk of growing harm to the global community.</p>
<p>While the risk may still be miniscule in most places, the range of risk rises to lethal in Fukushima itself. With the radioactive waste of four nuclear reactors (three of them in meltdown) under uncertain control for almost three years now, the risk of lethal exposure is very real for plant workers, and may decrease with distance from the plant, but may be calculable for anyone on the planet. No one seems to know. No one seems to have done the calculation. No one with access to the necessary information (assuming it exists) seems to want to do the calculation.</p>
<p>There is no moral excuse for this international collusion. The excuses are political or economic or social, but none of them excuses any authority for withholding or lying about information that has potentially universal and destructive impact on everyone alive today and everyone to be born for some unknown generations.</p>
<p><a href="http://fairewinds.org/media/fairewinds-videos/arnie-comments-fukushima-foia-documents" target="_blank">Japanese authorities</a> may be the worst current offenders against the truth, as well as the health and safety of their people. Now the <a href="http://rt.com/news/japan-state-secrets-law-712/" target="_blank">Japanese government</a> has passed a harsh <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2013/12/31/258655342/japans-state-secrets-law-hailed-by-u-s-denounced-by-japanese" target="_blank">state secrets law</a> that threatens to reduce or eliminate reliable information about Fukushima. The U.S. government officially applauded this <a href="http://rt.com/news/japan-state-secrets-law-712/" target="_blank">heightened secrecy</a>, while continuing its own tight control on nuclear information. Japanese authorities are already <a href="http://fairewinds.org/media/fairewinds-videos/japanese-government-isnt-saying-fukushima" target="_blank">attacking their own people</a> in defense of nuclear power: not only under-measuring and ignoring varieties of radioactive threat, but even withholding the iodine pills in 2011 that might have mitigated the <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1388611/surge-cancers-among-young-fukushima-experts-divided-cause" target="_blank">growing epidemic</a> of thyroid issues today. Failing to confront Fukushima honestly, the Japanese are laying the basis for what could amount to a radiological sneak attack on the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Just because no one seems to know what to do about Fukushima is no excuse to go on lying about and/or denying the dimensions of reality, whatever they might be.</p>
<p>There are hundreds, probably thousands of people with little or no authority who have long struggled to create a realistic, rational perspective on nuclear threats. The fundamental barrier to knowing the scale of the Fukushima disaster is just that: the scale of the Fukushima disaster.</p>
<h4>Chernobyl 1986 and Fukushima 2011 are Not Really Comparable</h4>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant" target="_blank">Chernobyl</a> is the closest precedent to Fukushima, and it’s not very close. Chernobyl at the time of the 1986 electric failure and explosion had four operating reactors and two more under construction. The Chernobyl accident involved one reactor meltdown. Other reactors kept operating for some time after the accident. The rector meltdown was eventually entombed, containing the meltdown and reducing the risk. Until Fukushima, Chernobyl was considered the worst nuclear power accident in history, and it is still far from over (albeit largely contained for the time being). The Chernobyl <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Exclusion_Zone" target="_blank">Exclusion Zone</a> of roughly 1,000 square miles remains one of the most radioactive areas in the world and the clean-up is not even expected to be complete before 2065.</p>
<p>At the time of the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster" target="_blank">Fukushima plant</a> had six operating reactors. Three of them went into meltdown and a fourth was left with a heavily laden fuel pool teetering a hundred feet above the ground. Two other reactors were undamaged and have been shut down. Radiation levels remain lethal in each of the melted-down reactors, where the meltdowns appear to be held in check by water that is pumped into the reactors to keep them cool. In the process, the water gets irradiated and that which is not collected on site in leaking tanks flows steadily into the Pacific Ocean. Within the first two weeks, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20285-fukushima-radioactive-fallout-nears-chernobyl-levels.html?full=true&amp;print=true#.UsSYgmRDuVs" target="_blank">Fukushima radiation</a> was comparable to Chernobyl’s and while the levels have gone down, they remain elevated.</p>
<p>The plant’s corporate owner, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Electric_Power_Company" target="_blank">Tokyo Electric Power</a> Company (TEPCO), in turn effectively owned by the Japanese government after a <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2012/05/tepco%E2%80%99s-nationalisation" target="_blank">2012 nationalization</a>, began removing more than 1,500 <a href="http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/nu/fukushima-np/removal4u/index-e.html" target="_blank">fuel rod assemblies</a> from the teetering fuel pool in November, a delicate process expected to take a year or more. There are additional fuel pools attached to each of the melted down reactors and a much larger general fuel pool, all of which contain nuclear fuel rod assemblies that are secure only as long as TEPCO continues to cool them. The Fukushima Exclusion Zone, a 12-mile radius around the nuclear plant, is about 500 square miles (much of it ocean); little <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/return-to-the-radiation-zone-fukushima-cleanup-operation-mired-in-fear-and-misinformation-8810158.html" target="_blank">specific information</a> about the exclusion zone is easily available, but <a href="http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,2064134,00.html" target="_blank">media coverage</a> in the form of <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/video/inside-japans-fukushima-exclusion-zone-15524477" target="_blank">disaster tourism</a> is plentiful, including a<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/imagery-on-google-maps-of-fukushima.html" target="_blank">Google Street View</a> interactive display.</p>
<p>Despite their significant differences as disasters, Chernobyl and Fukushima are both rated at 7 — a “major accident” on the International <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nuclear_Event_Scale" target="_blank">Nuclear Event Scale</a> designed in 1990 by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). That is the highest rating on the scale, a reflection of the inherent denial that colors most official nuclear thinking. Designed by nuclear “experts” after Chernobyl, the scale can’t imagine a worse accident than Chernobyl which, for all its intensity, was effectively over as an accident in a relatively short period of time. At Fukushima, by contrast, the initial set of events was less acute than Chernobyl, but almost three years later they continue without any resolution likely soon. Additionally Fukushima has three reactor meltdowns and thousands of precarious fuel rod assemblies in uncertain pools, any of which could produce a new crisis that would put Fukushima clearly off the scale.</p>
<p>And then there’s groundwater. Groundwater was not a problem at Chernobyl. Groundwater is a huge problem at the Fukushima plant that was built at the seashore, on a former riverbed, over an active aquifer. In a <a href="http://fairewinds.org/uncategorized/fukushima-daiichi-hard-clean" target="_blank">short video</a>, nuclear engineer Arnie Gunderson makes clear why groundwater makes Fukushima so hard to clean up, and why radiation levels there will likely remain dangerous for another hundred years.</p>
<h4>Fukushima Unit #3 Activity Led to Some Panic-Driven Reporting in 2013</h4>
<p>The Japanese government and nuclear power industry have a history of not telling the truth about nuclear accidents dating back at least to 1995, as reported by <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20263-japans-record-of-nuclear-coverups-and-accidents.html#.UsXbLmRDuVt" target="_blank"><em>New Scientist</em></a>and <a href="http://archives.politicususa.com/2011/03/15/rachel-maddow-japan-nuclear-2.html" target="_blank">Rachel Maddow</a>, among <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-17/japan-s-nuclear-disaster-caps-decades-of-faked-safety-reports-accidents.html" target="_blank">others</a>. Despite Japan’s history of nuclear dishonesty, Japanese authorities remain in total control of the Fukushima site and most of the information about it, without significant objection from most of the world’s governments, media, and other power brokers, whose reputation for honesty in nuclear matters is almost as bad as Japan’s. In such a context of no context, the public is vulnerable to <a href="http://www.turnerradionetwork.com/news/146-mjt" target="_blank">reports like this</a> from the <a href="http://turnerradionetwork.com/" target="_blank">Turner Radio Network</a> (TRN) on December 28:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><a href="http://www.turnerradionetwork.com/news/146-mjt" target="_blank">** NEWS FLASH — URGENT ** STEAM SUDDENLY EMANATING FROM FUKUSHIMA REACTOR # 3 — WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA SHOULD BEGIN PREPARATIONS FOR POSSIBLE RADIATION CLOUD WITHIN 3 TO 5 DAYS</a></em></p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/fukushima-radiation-wind-trajectories.jpg" width="300" height="200" />Five days after this story was posted, the “radiation cloud” had not developed despite the story’s assertion that: “Experts say this could be the beginning of a  spent fuel pool criticality (meltdown)’involving up to 89 TONS of nuclear fuel burning up into the atmosphere and heading to North America.” The story named no “experts” and provided links only to TEPCO announcements in Japanese. The bulk of the story reads like an infomercial for “protective” gear of various sorts that TRN makes a point of saying it does NOT sell. Despite such obvious warning signs, others — such as <a href="http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_round_up/2217953/fukushima_meltdown_mystery_steam_rising_over_reactor_3.html" target="_blank"><em>The Ecologist</em></a> and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/radioactive-mystery-steam-over-fukushima-could-mean-ano-1492280971" target="_blank"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> — reported the threat of “another meltdown” at Fukushima Unit #3 as imminent.</p>
<p>Clarification and reassurance quickly started chasing the “new meltdown” rumor around the Internet. <a href="http://enenews.com/steam-coming-from-fukushima-unit-3-reactor-building-observed-multiple-times-this-week" target="_blank"><em>ENENEWS</em></a> (Energy News) promptly posted the TEPCO reports in English, demonstrating that there was nothing “sudden” about the steam releases, they’ve been happening more or less daily since 2011, but condensation caused by cold weather makes them visible. At <a href="http://fairewinds.org/demystifying/fukushima-daiichi-unit-3-going-explode" target="_blank"><em>FAIREWINDS</em></a> (Energy Education), Arnie Gunderson posted on January 1:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“… the Internet has been flooded with conjecture claiming that Fukushima Daiichi Unit 3 is ready to explode… Our research, and discussions with other scientists, confirms that what we are seeing is a phenomenon that has been occurring at the Daiichi site since the March 2011 accident… While the plants are shutdown in nuke speak, there is no method of achieving cold shut down in any nuclear reactor. While the reactor can stop generating the actual nuclear chain reaction,<strong> the atoms left over from the original nuclear chain reaction continue to give off heat that is called the decay of the radioactive rubble (fission products)… constantly releasing moisture (steam) and radioactive products into the environment.” </strong></em>[emphasis added]</p></blockquote>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/fukushimaradiationmap3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>In other words, Fukushima Unit #3 continues to leak radioactivity into both air and water, as Units #1 and #2 presumably do as well. But as Gunderson explains, the level of radioactivity has declined sharply without becoming benign:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“When Unit 3 was operating, it was producing more than 2,000 megawatts of heat from the nuclear fission process (chain reaction in the reactor). Immediately after the earthquake and tsunami, it shut down and the chain reaction stopped, but Unit 3 was still producing about 160 megawatts of decay heat. Now, 30 months later, it is still producing slightly less than 1 megawatt (one million watts) of decay heat… 1 megawatt of decay heat is a lot of heat even today, and it is creating radioactive steam, but it is not a new phenomenon.”</em></p></blockquote>
<h4>Reassurances About Fukushima are As Misleading As Scare Stories</h4>
<p>The reassuring aspects of the condition of Unit #3 — radioactive releases are not new, they’re less intense than they once were, the nuclear waste is cooling — while true enough, provide only a false sense of comfort. Also true: radiation is released almost continuously, the releases are uncontrolled, no one seems to be measuring the releases, no one seems to be tracking the releases, no one is assessing accumulation of the releases. And while it’s true that the waste is cooling and decaying, it’s also true that a loss of coolant could lead to another uncontrolled chain reaction. (<em>“Fukushima Daiichi Unit 3 is not going to explode,”</em> says Gunderson in a headline, but he can’t know that with certainty.)</p>
<p>For the near future, what all that means, in effect, is that the world has to accept chronic radiation releases from Fukushima as the price for avoiding another catastrophic release. And even then, it’s not a sure thing.</p>
<p>But there’s another aspect of Fukushima Unit #3 that’s even less reassuring. Unit #3 is the one Fukushima reactor that was running on Mixed oxide fuel, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOX_fuel" target="_blank">MOX fuel</a>, in its fuel rods.<a href="http://www.nrc.gov/materials/fuel-cycle-fac/mox/faq.html" target="_blank">MOX fuel</a> typically uses Plutonium mixed with one or more forms of Uranium. Using<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium" target="_blank">Plutonium</a> in fuel rods adds to their toxicity in the event of a meltdown. In part because Plutonium-239 has a half-life of 240,000 years and can be used to make nuclear weapons of “dirty bombs,” its use in commercial reactors remains both <a href="http://www.nirs.org/factsheets/basicmoxinfo.htm" target="_blank">limited</a> and <a href="http://www.nirs.org/factsheets/basicmoxinfo.htm" target="_blank">controversial</a>. Because it contains Plutonium, MOX fuel is <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/03/15/mox-the-toxic-fuel-inside-japans-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-plant.html" target="_blank">more toxic</a> than other nuclear fuel and will burn at lower temperatures. As <em>Natural Resources News</em> reported in 2011:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The mixed oxide fuel rods used in the compromised number three reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi complex contain enough plutonium to threaten public health with the possibility of inhalation of airborne plutonium particles…. Plutonium is at its most dangerous when it is inhaled and gets into the lungs. The effect on the human body is to vastly increase the chance of developing fatal cancers.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Reportedly, TEPCO plans don’t call for the removal of the MOX fuel in Unit #3 for another decade or more. <a href="http://nuclear-news.net/2013/06/29/lethal-mox-fuel-to-be-removed-from-fukushima-reactor-no-3-starting-in-2020/" target="_blank">Fuel removal</a> from Units #1, #2, and #3 is complicated by lethal radiation levels at all three reactors, as well as TEPCO’s <a href="http://enenews.com/experts-portion-of-fukushimas-molten-fuel-is-believed-to-have-moved-into-earth-groundwater-contacting-melted-cores-may-have-caused-recent-spike-in-radiation-levels" target="_blank">inability so far to locate</a> the three melted cores with any precision.</p>
<p>There is ample reason to hope that Fukushima, despite the complex of uncontrollable and deteriorating factors, will not get worse, because even the Japanese don’t want that. But there is little reason to expect anything but worsening conditions, slowly or suddenly, for years and years to come. And there is even less reason to expect anyone in authority anywhere to be more than minimally and belatedly truthful about an industry they continue to protect, no matter how many people it damages or kills.</p>
<p>The perfect paradigm of that ruthlessly cynical nuclear mentality is the current Japanese practice of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/30/us-fukushima-workers-idUSBRE9BT00520131230" target="_blank">recruiting homeless people</a> to work at Fukushima in high level radiation areas where someone with something to lose might not be willing to go for minimum wage.</p>

<p>I also will be TWEETING it to every Media outlet I can find at <a href="https://twitter.com/wearewideawake">TWITTER</a>; but first a little background:</p>
<p>I learned about Vanunu while researching my first historical novel and wrote him into the Chapter <a href="http://wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1900&amp;Itemid=239">THANKSGIVING EVE 1987 </a></p>
<p>A few months later, I met Vanunu during my first of 8 journeys to both sides of The Wall in Israel Palestine and wrote that experience in the Chapter <a href="http://www.wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=940&amp;Itemid=201">16 Days in Israel Palestine</a><br />
<strong><br />
<a href="http://www.eileenfleming.org/index.php/eileens-blog/entry/mordechai-vanunus-upcoming-appeal-to-">The last time I saw Vanunu </a></strong>was a week before Thanksgiving 2013:</p>
<div><img title="b2ap3_thumbnail_112213-VMJC-ef.jpg" alt="b2ap3_thumbnail_112213-VMJC-ef.jpg" src="http://www.eileenfleming.org/images/easyblog_images/63/b2ap3_thumbnail_112213-VMJC-ef.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>One correction I have repeatedly addressed on the WWW is the <a href="http://www.wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=26">legend of Cindy/Cheryl and the “honey trap”</a>:</p>
<p>When I asked Vanunu what he was thinking when he took off with Cindy, he maintained eye contact and readily replied,</p>
<p>“It wasn’t like THAT-when Maxwell’s paper published my photo without ever talking to me and some of the stolen Dimona photos with a very bad story against me, I knew the Mossad was after me. Cindy said she had a sister in Rome and I thought I would be safe there until I could return to London.</p>
<p>“We went to movies and art galleries. I trusted her.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, as soon as I got into the apartment, I was hit on the head and drugged. When I woke up and they took me for interrogation, they threw the Times article on the table and said, ‘Look, what you did.’ I was so relieved they had published it and that I had done what I did.”</p>
<p>What &#8216;Cindy&#8217; did was masquerade as an American beautician on holiday in London. In reality, &#8216;Cindy&#8217; was the American Mossad agent, Cheryl Hanin Bentov who was using her sister-in-laws passport!</p>
<p>It is illegal under American-Israeli diplomatic protocols for the Mossad to operate in America.</p>

<p>Dear New York Times,</p>
<p>As the current leader of the <a href="https://www.causes.com/profiles/188026196/about">International Cause dedicated to help free Mordechai Vanunu</a>, I am informing you of Mordechai Vanunu&#8217;s mid December Appeal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eileenfleming.org/index.php/eileens-blog/entry/mordechai-vanunus-upcoming-appeal-to-">On 6 December, Vanunu wrote:</a> &#8220;Court hearing against the restrictions not to leave Israel, schedule hearing in the Supreme court will be Dec&#8217; 16, 2013. The same Appeal was in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011<strong>. The court can send me free and end all this case from 1986-2013.</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1986, Israel kidnapped Vanunu from Rome and after a closed door trial, convicted him of espionage and treason.   Although released on 21 April 2004, Israel has denied Vanunu the right to  &#8220;get on the first plane out of here.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1985, Vanunu suffered a crisis of conscience, when he realized he was &#8220;a bolt&#8221; in the manufacturing of WMD.</p>
<p>After a supervisor carelessly left the keys in the shower room, Vanunu seized his opportunity to document top secret locations within Israel&#8217;s 7-story underground nuclear facility and he spent a few intense hours doing just that!</p>
<p>View Vanunu&#8217;s photos of the Dimona at his YouTube Channel:<br />
<iframe title="YouTube video player" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4nSOlG6Wpr8?wmode=transparent" height="225" width="400" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>A few months later, Vanunu leaves Israel and travels throughout Europe with the two rolls of undeveloped film.   After meeting Peter Hounam, a reporter for the London Sunday Times, Vanunu shares all he knew in his position as a mid-level technician and the two develop the film.</p>
<p>A total of 1,200 pages of transcript of Vanunu&#8217;s closed door trial have been released.<br />
Defense witness Peter Hounam stated, &#8220;We did not pay him money, but only covered his expenses&#8230;Money did not motivate him.&#8221;</p>
<p>During my conversations with <a href="http://www.wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=26">Vanunu beginning in 2005, he told me:<br />
</a><br />
&#8220;All the secrets I had were published in 1989 in an important book, by [Nuclear Physicist] Frank Barnaby, <em><strong>The Invisible Bomb: Nuclear Arms Race in the Middle East.</strong></em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Barnaby testified, &#8220;I found Vanunu very straightforward about his motives for violating Israel&#8217;s secrecy laws he explained to me that he believed that both the Israeli and the world public had the right to know about the information he passed on. He seemed to me to be acting ideologically.<br />
<strong><br />
&#8220;Israel&#8217;s political leaders have, he said, consistently lied about Israel&#8217;s nuclear-weapons programme and he found this unacceptable in a democracy. </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The knowledge that Vanunu had about Israel&#8217;s nuclear weapons, about the operations at Dimona, and about security at Dimona could not be of any use to anyone today. He left Dimona in October 1985.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=26"><br />
Vanunu also told me:<br />
</a><br />
“Did you know that President Kennedy tried to stop Israel from building atomic weapons? In 1963, he forced Prime Minister Ben Guirion to admit the Dimona was not a textile plant, as the sign outside proclaimed, but a nuclear plant. The Prime Minister said, ‘The nuclear reactor is only for peace.’</p>
<p>“Kennedy insisted on an open internal inspection. He wrote letters demanding that Ben Guirion open up the Dimona for inspection.</p>
<p>“The French were responsible for the actual building of the Dimona. The Germans gave the money; they were feeling guilty for the Holocaust, and tried to pay their way out.</p>
<p>“When Johnson became president, he made an agreement with Israel that two senators would come every year to inspect. Before the senators would visit, the Israelis would build a wall to block the underground elevators and stairways. From 1963 to ’69, the senators came, but they never knew about the wall that hid the rest of the Dimona from them.</p>
<p>“Nixon stopped the inspections and agreed to ignore the situation. As a result, Israel increased production. In 1986, there were over two hundred bombs. Today, they may have enough plutonium for ten bombs a year.”</p>

<p>As the current leader of the <a href="https://www.causes.com/profiles/188026196/about">international cause dedicated to free Mordechai Vanunu </a>I write to alert you that on<a href="http://www.eileenfleming.org/index.php/eileens-blog/entry/mordechai-vanunus-upcoming-appeal-to-"> 9 December, Vanunu wrote:</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Changes in date, Court hearing against the restrictions not to leave Israel, schedule <strong>hearing in the Supreme court will be Dec&#8217; 25, 2013</strong>, moved from the Dec&#8217; 16, the same Appeal was 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. <strong>The court can send me free and end all this case from 1986-2013.</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>The restrictions that have subjected Vanunu to 24/7 surveillance [his movements, phone calls and emails] since he emerged from 18 years behind bars on 21 April 2004, come from the Emergency Defense Regulations, which were implemented by Britain against Palestinians and Jews after World War II.</p>
<p>Attorney Yaccov Shapiro, who later became Israel&#8217;s Minister Of Justice, described the Emergency Defense Regulations as &#8220;unparalleled in any civilized country: there were no such laws in Nazi Germany.&#8221;</p>

<p>On 2 October 2009,<strong> The Washington Times</strong> reported that President Obama agreed to keep Israel&#8217;s nukes &#8216;secret&#8217; and reaffirmed a 4-decade-old understanding that has allowed Israel to keep a nuclear arsenal without opening it to international inspections.</p>
<p>Three officials spoke on the condition that they not be named because they were discussing private conversations, but all said Obama pledged to maintain the agreement when he first hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House in May 2009.</p>
<p><strong>On 24, November 2006,</strong> Vanunu wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;My lawyer succeeded to reveal a few very important facts: This General of the Army also was not allowed to see all the secrets that he is required to protect by these restrictions that they claim I know them. So, he gave orders of restrictions without knowing what he is protecting or that he is also following orders blindly, and Mossad Sheen Bet using its authority for just punishing me.</p>
<p>&#8220;He testified that it is not a crime for me to talk with foreigners in general anywhere. He testified that I can speak freely to any Israeli citizens about anything; it is not his concern what I am saying to them. These Israelis can give this information to any foreigners. It was difficult for the Judge to understand why this dichotomy exits between foreigners and Israelis. It means that it is not about secrecy but about something else.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>In 2004, </strong>Yossi Melman wrote for Haaretz:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the secret that hasn&#8217;t yet been told in the affair: the story of the security fiasco that made it possible for Vanunu to do what he did, and the story of the subsequent attempts at cover-up, whitewashing and protection of senior figures in the defense establishment, who were bent on divesting themselves of responsibility for the failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Will the New York Times shine a light on Israel&#8217;s Nuclear Whistle Blower&#8217;s nearly 10 year struggle for freedom from Israel before his Christmas Day appeal?</p>

<p>&#8220;There exists in this country a plot to enslave every man, woman, and child. Before I leave this high and noble office I intend to expose this plot.&#8221; <a href="http://daisyluther.blogspot.com/2012/03/famous-last-words.html">John F Kennedy, just before his Assassination&#8230;</a></p>
<p>For those who were of age and alive at the time of the Dallas killing, a fresh memory of the times and era are integral to their assessment. Those who were born later, have no firsthand experience of the actual change that took place to the body politics. Comparing before and after is mostly forgotten by the history accounts. For those who remember, the country started on a downward spiral that continues to the present. The assassination of John F. Kennedy was a political coup d&#8217;état and has been described as an enigma with many layers of disinformation. However, peeling back this onion exposes a rot that very much explains the current condition of our country.</p>
<p>When raising the subject of a conspiracy, it is both amusing and tragic that establishment defenders are quick to discredit the investigator, while avoiding facts, evidence and common sense. Solving the mystery to the satisfaction of competing and often conflicting factions is not necessary. However, understanding the course of events that took hold after the Camelot myth was buried is intensely valuable. The end of innocence became an existential awakening to the perceptive, while believing the conclusions of the Warren commission provided reassurance for not facing reality.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NM0QY1k9N_M" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why did powerful elites fear Kennedy? The <a href="http://youtu.be/NM0QY1k9N_M">Entire John F. Kennedy Secret Society Speech</a> provides the motive behind the mask of the media filter.</p>
<p>From this &#8220;<a href="http://millercenter.org/president/speeches/detail/3677">President and the Press</a>&#8221; Speech (April 27, 1961)</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The very word &#8220;secrecy&#8221; is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. And no official of my Administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.rense.com/general40/thewnk.htm" target="_self"><img alt="wink.jpg" src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/wink.jpg.w300h170.jpg" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Remember that most famous of all <a href="http://www.rense.com/general40/thewnk.htm">winks</a> at the LBJ swearing in? Look to <a href="http://batr.org/wrack_/012402.html">None Dare Call It Conspiracy!</a>, and put the pieces of the puzzle in place.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The significance of the Stone film, JFK, is demonstrated by the assault that the established order heaped upon his portrayal. Believe it or reject it, but investigate the questions that have never been answered. If logic has meaning, have Arlene Spector explain that magic bullet again. That &#8216;Man X&#8217; was real &#8211; his name, colonel Fletcher Prouty, a true &#8216;black bag&#8217; magician.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Lyndon B. Johnson initiated the Reign on Terror that continues to this day. His involvement into the plot is supported in the new book, <a href="http://stonezone.com/">The Man Who Killed Kennedy: The Case Against LBJ</a> by Roger Stone with Mike Colapietro.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The notable individuals that knew and said Johnson was involved in murderous acts is also well-documented&#8230; they include Oswald murderer Jack Ruby, Dexter Scott King, son of Dr. Martin Luther King, as well as LBJ associate Billy Sol Estes, LBJ mistress Madeleine Brown, Texas Governor Allan Shivers, renowned Texas Ranger Clint Peoples, CIA asset E. Howard Hunt and US Senator and 1964 Republican nominee for President Barry Goldwater. The KGB, fearing that they or their puppet state Cuba would be falsely blamed conducted their own investigation and concluded LBJ killed JFK at the same to time French Intelligence would tell Jackie Kennedy LBJ murdered her husband.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If this is just too much to accept, look at the &#8220;Skull and Bones&#8221; operative, who just happened to be a Texas Oilman. Similarly, he was Vice President at the time of an assassination attempt that almost was successful. Sure, such a coincidence should be fodder for an Oliver Stone sequel – Reagan.</p>
<p>Now consider the CIA component in the &#8220;Big Event&#8221;. <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2013/03/30/did-george-h-w-bush-coordinate-a-jfk-hit-team/">Did George H.W. Bush Coordinate a JFK Hit Team?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Next, George Bush can be seen in photos of Dealey Plaza, next to the TSBD doorway and Ed Lansdale, shortly following the assassination (see below). These photos, unmistakably George Bush, tell us where he went after he left the Dallas Sheriff’s Office: back to the crime scene to get an update on all that he had missed. He must have made his call to the FBI reporting James Parrot from the Dallas Sheriff’s Office, at 1:45 PM, because Bush is seen in Dealey Plaza with Lansdale, who would leave the plaza at about 2 PM and walk past &#8220;the three tramps&#8221; toward the parking lot. Bush obviously had to go straight back to Dealey Plaza for him to be photographed with Lansdale, who remained around Dealey Plaza until Oswald was arrested at the Texas Theater at 1:50 PM.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI was up to his ears in the investigation. He certainly was no friend of the Kennedy’s. Therefore, when <a href="http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/witnesses.htm">eyewitness testimony</a> from scores of witnesses was ignored or discarded by the Bureau, no one should be surprised that the final report will be suspect. The <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/wiki/index.php/The_CIA_and_the_JFK_Assassination">Mary Ferrell Foundation</a> site furnishes the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/wiki/index.php/Church_Committee">Church Committee</a> in the 1970s analyzed the CIA&#8217;s role in supporting the Warren Commission, and <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=150466">found it lacking</a>. The Committee &#8220;developed evidence which impeaches the process by which the intelligence agencies [CIA and FBI] arrived at their own conclusions about the assassination, and by which they provided information to the Warren Commission.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Z11k1rlVokQ" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now watch the video from Jim Marrs &amp; St. John Hunt - <a href="http://youtu.be/Z11k1rlVokQ">E. Howard Hunt Deathbed Confession JFK Assassination</a>. A dying admission once held legal merit. But in this disinformation world of government scripted deflection, the public needs to be kept in tranquil ignorance. The <a href="http://www.dailypaul.com/263992/the-jfk-murder-and-george-hw-bushs-connection-nixon-staffer-e-howard-hunts-confession?from=lbp">Daily Paul</a> site provided additional information.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;One of most explosive under-reported stories of the last 50 years is the deathbed confession of E. Howard Hunt, who was personal assistant to Allen Dulles, head of the CIA at the time, to knowledge that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone and that he, Hunt, had been personally involved in the assassination. Hunt said in his written confession that the assassination was code-named &#8220;the Big Event.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Whatever determination you maintain on the actual circumstances, the results from JFK’s elimination are dramatic. <a href="http://www.offthegridnews.com/2012/01/31/5-ways-the-kennedy-assassination-changed-modern-america/">Five Fiendish Ways the Kennedy Assassination Warped Our World</a> list is an effective analysis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. LBJ Unleashed &#8211; Johnson’s profligate Great Society spending strategies, which took the New Deal and accelerated it into hyper-drive.</p>
<p>2. Vietnam &#8211; in October of 1963, Kennedy issued National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 263, which detailed his plan to withdraw U.S. advisers from Vietnam while gradually scaling back our involvement in Southeast Asia. But within four days of the assassination, Lyndon Johnson had already signed and submitted NSAM 273, which reversed course and basically pledged to stand by the government in South Vietnam come hell or high water.</p>
<p>3. The Federal Reserve Survives &#8211; In June of 1963, Kennedy signed Executive Order 11110, which authorized the U.S. Treasury to issue certificates backed by silver as an alternative form of money to Federal Reserve notes. But when President Kennedy was killed, LBJ suspended this program immediately, and the Federal Reserve’s control over the U.S. economy has never once been challenged since.</p>
<p>4. The CIA and Our Culture of Secrecy &#8211; Kennedy’s statement to &#8220;splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the wind&#8221;, his death allowed the CIA to continue and preserve its culture of secrecy.</p>
<p>5. Mainstream Nonsense and the Mainstream Media &#8211; The vast majority of the Fourth Estate took the path of least resistance, and the idea of an independent media that would fearlessly search for the truth no matter where it led died a painful and difficult death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what is the significance of the JFK Assassination? In an interview, <a href="http://voiceofrussia.com/2013_11_08/Lyndon-B-Johnson-arranged-John-F-Kennedys-assassination-Roger-Stone-5591/">Roger Stone</a> answers the question: How did JFK&#8217;s death affect society, people&#8217;s minds? Is the impact still present in your opinion?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think it certainly changed our policy very dramatically – I think we moved it back into the Cold War. After the death of John F. Kennedy the important conversations between the Russian State and the United States were damaged. We know, because it was historically recorded that Nikita Khrushchev wept, when he heard of the death of Kennedy. There was an American journalist who was with Fidel Castro, when he was distraught what he learned: he said over and over again &#8220;this is very bad, this is very bad&#8221;… I think we were engaged – we were beginning to engage in some fruitful conversations in terms of easing the tensions between our countries and I think there were those in the Pentagon, those in the US military, those in our US-based intelligent services who were very unhappy about that direction. I think it is a major factor – not the factor, &#8211; but a major factor in getting John F. Kennedy killed.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the contention of this &#8220;Reign of Terror&#8221; series to provide accounts and evidence that the nation has endured under a shadow government of ruling elites; especially, since the elimination of a President, who dared challenge the interests of the true masters of the establishment.</p>
<p>The deplorable circumstance of a society, so ignorant to make distinctions, of real history from invented official fairy tales, explains largely why Americans are in serial denial. The article <a href="http://batr.org/wrack/111803.html">JFK retrospectives adnauseam</a>, makes this point.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People never learn. After the sanctioned assassination, healing the country provided the necessary cover to implement the goals of the coup. Most of the evidence that explains the background that led up to the removal of Kennedy fails to address the breakdown of the entire historic underpinning of the nation, since WWII. The seeds of the Great Society were sown in the idiocy of being dragged into that global contrived conflict. Those who should know best, since they lived during that era, often deny their own blind faith in a misguided allegiance to a central government.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

</div>
<p>As for the population that never knew or heard actual accounts of this age, &#8220;so called&#8221; news reporting usually sugar coats or distorts the facts, ignorance really is not bliss. Today’s electronic media is a hodgepodge of government talking points or press releases.</p>
<p>The constant drumbeat to blame Lee Harvey Oswald solely for the Kennedy assassination intends to make patsies of the American people. The greater fool theory works in elections. In a <a href="http://ap-gfkpoll.com/featured/our-latest-story-3">New poll finds that belief in JFK assassination conspiracy still strong, but slipping slightly</a> may be a trend worth noting. Reflecting the goals of the &#8220;Great Society&#8221; means, that acceptance of government authoritarianism became easier.</p>
<p><a href="http://batr.org/wrack_/013002.html">Deconstructing the JFK Myth</a> offers this distinction. &#8220;<strong>Ask not what your country can do for you &#8212; ask what you can do for your country.</strong>&#8221; The invocation needed to read: &#8220;<em>Ask not what you can do for your country &#8212; Ask what we can do together to insure individual Liberty</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Propagandists of the ilk of Sargeant Shriver and Arthur Schlesinger Jr., designed a legend that defied factual references&#8221;, but the martyrdom of a slain President misses the point. John Kennedy was not a saint, but was an obstacle. What better message to future aspirant reformers that a magic bullet awaits their demise.</p>
<p>Few institutional government critics were known for rocking the boat, especially when Kennedy’s &#8220;a rising tide lifts all boats&#8221; might upset his elitist executioners. The system is much bigger than any individual. Bucking the sub-rosa interests that seek greater concentrated control can be deadly. America was condemned to a Reign of Terror on November 22, 1963.</p>

			<p>New York &#8211; Jeremy Hammond sat in New York’s Metropolitan Correctional Center last week in a small room reserved for visits from attorneys. He was wearing an oversized prison jumpsuit. The brown hair of the lanky 6-footer fell over his ears, and he had a wispy beard. He spoke with the intensity and clarity one would expect from one of the nation’s most important political prisoners.</p>
<p>On Friday the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/28/jeremy-hammond-anonymous-hacker-guilty-stratfor_n_3347215.html">28-year-old activist</a> will appear for sentencing in the Southern District Court of New York in Manhattan. After having made a plea agreement, he faces the possibility of a 10-year sentence for hacking into the Texas-based private security firm Strategic Forecasting Inc., or Stratfor, which does work for the Homeland Security Department, the Marine Corps, the Defense Intelligence Agency and numerous corporations including Dow Chemical and Raytheon.</p>
<p>Four others involved in the hacking have been convicted in Britain, and they were sentenced to less time combined—the longest sentence was 32 months—than the potential 120-month sentence that lies before Hammond.</p>
<p>Hammond turned the pilfered information over to the website WikiLeaks and <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/the-rise-and-fall-of-jeremy-hammond-enemy-of-the-state-20121207">Rolling Stone</a> and other publications. The 3 million email exchanges, once</p>

<p>made public, exposed the private security firm’s infiltration, monitoring and surveillance of protesters and dissidents, especially in the Occupy movement, on behalf of corporations and the national security state. And, perhaps most important, the information provided chilling evidence that anti-terrorism laws are being routinely used by the federal government to criminalize nonviolent, democratic dissent and falsely link dissidents to international terrorist organizations. Hammond sought no financial gain. He got none.The email exchanges Hammond made public were entered as evidence in <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/the_last_chance_to_stop_the_ndaa_20130902">my lawsuit</a>against President Barack Obama over Section 1021 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Section 1021 permits the military to seize citizens who are deemed by the state to be terrorists, strip them of due process and hold them indefinitely in military facilities. Alexa O’Brien, a content strategist and journalist who co-founded US Day of Rage, an organization created to reform the election process, was one of my co-plaintiffs. Stratfor officials attempted, we know because of the Hammond leaks, to falsely link her and her organization to Islamic radicals and websites as well as to jihadist ideology, putting her at risk of detention under the new law. Judge Katherine B. Forrest ruled, in part because of the leak, that we plaintiffs had a credible fear, and she nullified the law, a decision that an appellate court overturned when the Obama administration appealed it.</p>
<p>Freedom of the press and legal protection for those who expose government abuses and lies have been obliterated by the corporate state. The resulting self-exile of investigative journalists such as <a href="http://www.advocate.com/print-issue/current-issue/2013/10/24/enemy-state">Glenn Greenwald</a>, <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/jacob-appelbaum-utopia-interview">Jacob Appelbaum</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/laura-poitras-snowden.html">Laura Poitras</a>, along with the indictment of <a href="http://freebarrettbrown.org/">Barret Brown</a>, illustrate this. All acts of resistance—including nonviolent protest—have been conflated by the corporate state with terrorism. The mainstream, commercial press has been emasculated through the Obama administration’s repeated use of the Espionage Act to charge and sentence traditional whistle-blowers. Governmental officials with a conscience are too frightened to reach out to mainstream reporters, knowing that the authorities’ wholesale capturing and storing of electronic forms of communication make them easily identifiable.</p>
<p>Elected officials and the courts no longer impose restraint or practice oversight. The last line of defense lies with those such as Hammond, Julian Assange, Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning who are capable of burrowing into the records of the security and surveillance state and have the courage to pass them on to the public. But the price of resistance is high.</p>
<p>“In these times of secrecy and abuse of power there is only one solution—transparency,” wrote <a href="http://www.dw.de/sarah-harrison-ally-of-ex-nsa-contractor-snowden-in-germany/a-17211444">Sarah Harrison</a>, the British journalist who accompanied Snowden to Russia and who also has gone into exile, in Berlin. “If our governments are so compromised that they will not tell us the truth, then we must step forward to grasp it. Provided with the unequivocal proof of primary source documents people can fight back. If our governments will not give this information to us, then we must take it for ourselves.”</p>
<p>“When whistleblowers come forward we need to fight for them, so others will be encouraged,” she went on. “When they are gagged, we must be their voice. When they are hunted, we must be their shield. When they are locked away, we must free them. Giving us the truth is not a crime. This is our data, our information, our history. We must fight to own it. Courage is contagious.”</p>
<p>Hammond knows this contagion. He was living at home in Chicago in 2010 under a 7-a.m.-to-7-p.m. curfew for a variety of acts of civil disobedience when Chelsea (formerly Bradley) Manning was arrested for giving WikiLeaks secret information about military war crimes and government lies. Hammond at the time was running social aid programs to feed the hungry and send books to prisoners. He had, like Manning, displayed a remarkable aptitude for science, math and computer languages at a young age. He hacked into the computers at a local Apple store at 16. He hacked into the computer science department’s website at the University of Illinois-Chicago as a freshman, a prank that saw the university refuse to allow him to return for his sophomore year. He was an early backer of “cyber-liberation” and in 2004 started an “electronic-disobedience journal” he named Hack This Zine. He called on hackers in a speech at the 2004 DefCon convention in Las Vegas to use their skills to disrupt that year’s Republican National Convention. He was, by the time of his 2012 arrest, one of the shadowy stars of the hacktivist underground, dominated by groups such as Anonymous and WikiLeaks in which anonymity, stringent security and frequent changes of aliases alone ensured success and survival. Manning’s courage prompted Hammond to his own act of cyber civil disobedience, although he knew his chances of being caught were high.</p>
<p>“I saw what Chelsea Manning did,” Hammond said when we spoke last Wednesday, seated at a metal table. “Through her hacking she became a contender, a world changer. She took tremendous risks to show the ugly truth about war. I asked myself, if she could make that risk shouldn’t I make that risk? Wasn’t it wrong to sit comfortably by, working on the websites of Food Not Bombs, while I had the skills to do something similar? I too could make a difference. It was her courage that prompted me to act.”</p>
<p>Hammond—who has black-inked tattoos on each forearm, one the open-source movement’s symbol known as <a href="http://www.catb.org/hacker-emblem/">the “glider”</a> and the other <a href="http://www.iching123.com/7_text.htm">the shi hexagram</a> from the I Ching—is steeped in radical thought. As a teenager, he swiftly migrated politically from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party to the militancy of the <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/the_cancer_of_occupy_20120206">Black Bloc</a> anarchists. He was an avid reader in high school of material put out by <a href="http://www.crimethinc.com/">CrimethInc</a>, an anarchist collective that publishes anarchist literature and manifestos. He has molded himself after old radicals such as Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman and black revolutionaries such as George Jackson, Elaine Brown and Assata Shakur, as well as members of the Weather Underground. He said that while he was in Chicago he made numerous trips to Waldheim Cemetery to visit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Haymarket_Martyr's_Memorial.jpg">Haymarket Martyrs Monument</a>, which honors four anarchists who were hanged in 1887 and others who took part in the labor wars. On the 16-foot-high granite monument are the final words of one of the condemned men, August Spies. It reads: “The day will come when our silence will be more powerful than the voice you are throttling today.” Emma Goldman is buried nearby.</p>
<p>Hammond became well known to the government for a variety of acts of civil disobedience over the last decade. These ranged from painting anti-war graffiti on Chicago walls to protesting at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York to hacking into the right-wing website Protest Warrior, for which he was sentenced to two years in the Federal Correctional Institute at Greenville, Ill.</p>
<p>He said he is fighting as “an anarchist communist” against “centralized state authority” and “exploitative corporations.” His goal is to build “leaderless collectives based on free association, consensus, mutual aid, self-sufficiency and harmony with the environment.” It is essential, he said, that all of us work to cut our personal ties with capitalism and engage in “mass organizing of protests, strikes and boycotts.” Hacking and leaking, he said, are part of this resistance—“effective tools to reveal ugly truths of the system.”</p>
<p>Hammond spent months within the Occupy movement in Chicago. He embraced its “leaderless, non-hierarchical structures such as general assemblies and consensus, and occupying public spaces.” But he was highly critical of what he said were the “vague politics” in Occupy that allowed it to include followers of the libertarian Ron Paul, some in the tea party, as well as “reformist liberals and Democrats.” Hammond said he was not interested in any movement that “only wanted a ‘nicer’ form of capitalism and favored legal reforms, not revolution.” He remains rooted in the ethos of the Black Bloc.</p>
<p>“Being incarcerated has really opened my eyes to the reality of the criminal justice system,” he said, “that it is not a criminal justice system about public safety or rehabilitation, but reaping profits through mass incarceration. There are two kinds of justice—one for the rich and the powerful who get away with the big crimes, then for everyone else, especially people of color and the impoverished. There is no such thing as a fair trial. In over 80 percent of the cases people are pressured to plea out instead of exercising their right to trial, under the threat of lengthier sentences. I believe no satisfactory reforms are possible. We need to close all prisons and release everybody unconditionally.”</p>
<p>He said he hoped his act of resistance would encourage others, just as Manning’s courage had inspired him. He said activists should “know and accept the worst possible repercussion” before carrying out an action and should be “aware of mass counterintelligence/surveillance operations targeting our movements.” An informant posing as a comrade, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector_Xavier_Monsegur">Hector Xavier Monsegur</a>, known online as “Sabu,” turned Hammond and his co-defendants in to the FBI. Monsegur stored data retrieved by Hammond on an external server in New York. This tenuous New York connection allowed the government to try Hammond in New York for hacking from his home in Chicago into a private security firm based in Texas. New York is the center of the government’s probes into cyber-warfare; it is where federal authorities apparently wanted Hammond to be investigated and charged.</p>
<p>Hammond said he will continue to resist from within prison. A series of minor infractions, as well as testing positive with other prisoners on his tier for marijuana that had been smuggled into the facility, has resulted in his losing social visits for the next two years and spending “time in the box [solitary confinement].” He is allowed to see journalists, but my request to interview him took two months to be approved. He said prison involves “a lot of boredom.” He plays chess, teaches guitar and helps other prisoners study for their GED. When I saw him, he was working on the statement, a personal manifesto, that he will read in court this week.</p>
<p>He insisted he did not see himself as different from prisoners, especially poor prisoners of color, who are in for common crimes, especially drug-related crimes. He said most inmates are political prisoners, caged unjustly by a system of totalitarian capitalism that has snuffed out basic opportunities for democratic dissent and economic survival.</p>
<p>“The majority of people in prison did what they had to do to survive,” he said. “Most were poor. They got caught up in the war on drugs, which is how you make money if you are poor. The real reason they get locked in prison for so long is so corporations can continue to make big profits. It is not about justice. I do not draw distinctions between us.”</p>
<p>“Jail is essentially enduring harassment and dehumanizing conditions with frequent lockdowns and shakedowns,” he said. “You have to constantly fight for respect from the guards, sometimes getting yourself thrown in the box. However, I will not change the way I live because I am locked up. I will continue to be defiant, agitating and organizing whenever possible.”</p>
<p>He said resistance must be a way of life. He intends to return to community organizing when he is released, although he said he will work to stay out of prison. “The truth,” he said, “will always come out.” He cautioned activists to be hyper-vigilant and aware that “one mistake can be permanent.” But he added, “Don’t let paranoia or fear deter you from activism. Do the down thing!”</p>

<p>“The trade in derivatives, using home notes, was designed as a Ponzi scheme. Excel knew it. Cadwalader, Wickersham &#038; Taft (CWT), knew it. My fellow junior associates laughed at me, senior associates got mad at me, and the senior partners ultimately asked me to resign or be fired when I wrote repeated lengthy memoranda explaining this out to them.” &#8211; Charles Lincoln, III, PH.D., Harvard, J.D., University of Chicago, School of Law</p>
<p><strong>Who is Charles Lincoln, III?</strong></p>
<p>In October, 1993, Charles Lincoln, III began work as an associate at Cadwalader, Wickersham &#038; Taft (CWT). He had just completed a judicial clerkship for Kenneth L. Ryskamp, U. S. District Judge, Southern District of Florida. During his clerkship with Judge Ryskamp, Lincoln had planned, coordinated, and framed the jury questions for a very large securities fraud trial in Palm Beach against Alan B. Levan’s Florida-based BankAtlantic Bancorp and Subsidiary Bank Atlantic Financial Company (BAFCO), which were heavily involved in Florida Real Estate from 1952-2011.</p>
<p>What he was about to learn, and challenge, would change the course of his life, from one of privilege to destitution.</p>
<p>In many ways, Lincoln might have appeared exactly the kind of associate who could be expected to make partner rapidly. Ambitious, bright, and energetic, CWT hired him because he received top law school grades in Securities, Antitrust, and Banking Law, as well as for his clerkship experience in Securities &#038; Banking cases in the post-S &#038; L Collapse period in Florida. He had also been President of the Environmental Law Society at University of Chicago, School of Law.</p>
<p>In law school, he had become intrigued by the role of securities in establishing, maintaining, and shaping the global-elites of the 20th century. The complexities of hierarchical and socio-political structures had been his greatest interest in Anthropology &#038; History at Harvard.</p>
<p>In his first month at CWT he turned in 393 billable hours wildly exceeding any expectations. First year associates are expected to bill at least 2000 hours per year, Lincoln managed to do this in less than six months. At Cadwalader, Lincoln aspired to a professional specialization in securities litigation, fraud, shareholder’s and directors’ relations, rights and obligations, general agency and relationships of fiduciary duty.</p>
<p>Lincoln had taken up law as a second career after a decade as a working archeologist in Mexico &#038; Central America, during which time he wrote a doctoral dissertation “Ethnicity &#038; Social Organization at Chichen Itza, Yucatan” at Harvard’s Peabody Museum. His dissertation resulted from a project he directed in his 20s, funded by the National Geographic Society, Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology &#038; Ethnology, and private donors such as Doris Zemurray Stone and novelist James A. Michener.</p>
<p>As an archaeologist, Lincoln had become frustrated, acutely aware of problems mounting in the world, which originated in finance. Determined to use law creatively as a force for positive change, he enrolled at the University of Chicago, School of Law. At the school, he served as President of the Environmental Law Society (ELS), presiding on a year-long symposium at the Law School in 1990-1991, concerning oil spills in the immediate wake of the Exxon Valdez disaster of March 24, 1989.</p>
<p>Raised as the grandson, and effectively adopted son, of a wealthy petro-chemical engineer &#038; military supplier in Highland Park, Dallas, Texas, Lincoln was not a stranger to the better addresses in New York. The welcome dinner held at the Waldorf Astoria for the twenty associates hired at the same time, of which he was one, did not impress him. Cadwalader, Wickersham, &#038; Taft, though claiming to be the oldest, founded in 1792, the same year as the New York Stock Exchange, was by no means the largest.</p>
<p>Lincoln knew Cadwalader’s history and greatest claim to fame and power. This is its status as primary law firm to the Bank of New York (BNY), now BNY-Mellon, founded in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, 8 years before Cadwalader opened its doors under a different name.</p>
<p>The long relationship between the oldest bank and the oldest Wall Street Law Firm include Cadwalader’s role in setting up BNY to be the very first law firm to be traded on the NYSE. Cadwalader’s historical policies have consistently, matched and supported those of the BNY and the thinking of Alexander Hamilton.</p>
<p>Cadwalader’s flagship office was then at 100 Maiden Lane, in New York 10038, close to the heart of the financial district in New York.</p>
<p>Having been hired on for Cadwalader’s litigation department, Lincoln encountered a department which was essentially inactive in 1993. The only the only active cases involved municipal defense to voting rights act cases in California.</p>
<p>Even the litigators, in 1993, were all working on one project, one particular project which was shrouded in great mystery and secrecy.</p>
<p><strong>The Excel Mortgage Project</strong></p>
<p>Instead of litigation, Lincoln along with all other first year associates, were temporarily to work with the “Structured Finance Department” on preparing the registration statement of Excel Mortgage. Lincoln’s role was to review and assess a series of some 1500 Arizona residential properties in relationship to state and federal environmental law and geographic issues, such as cultural resource management, and other points relating to the entire history and possible condition and liabilities of these properties.</p>
<p>The 1500 or so properties, subject of his study, were earmarked as assets being “deposited” into the Excel Mortgage Bond Fund, along with promissory notes originated by a number of creditors on homes conforming to a certain size and value profile, but having no other relationship. These were not part of the same communities, not part of a single development project, not built by a common builder, or anything else. This struck Lincoln as strange. Why “pool” all these unrelated properties together? And would be in the completed “pool?” Why was the Bank of New York underwriting this project?</p>
<p><strong>Enter the Securitized Derivative</strong></p>
<p>Excel Mortgage, a highly valued client of CWT was about to become part of history, doing something that had never been done before: registering a bond for sale to the public, which bond was based on pooled notes, a hybrid of debt and equity interests in and contingent claims to realty. This type of financial instrument had never before been sold to the public, though it had existed for about 25 years in the “private placement” market.</p>
<p>Lincoln was unwittingly participating in the first initial public offering (IPO) of a bond, a debt instrument, derived in part from promissory notes, &#8216;debts,&#8217; and in part from contingent pledges of title, &#8216;secured equity,&#8217; in residential real estate.</p>
<p>Securitized derivatives were being born at 100 Maiden Lane.</p>
<p>Bernard Madoff, who founded the NASDAQ when he was 33, was a prominent client of CWT, walking the floors of Cadwalader late at night.</p>
<p>The entire staff of CWT, underwritten by the Bank of New York, supporting Excel, were charged getting these new-fangled “derivative” instruments past examination by the Securities &#038; Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>This was an arduous, and expensive task, necessitating a “lint-picking” review, before these &#8216;derivative instruments&#8217; could be packaged under the name of Excel Mortgage and offered both on the NYSE and NASDAQ. An SEC Registration Statement is an application for Federal Blessings affirming investing in a certain stock, bond, or “other instrument or obligation” is a reasonable investment for an average investor to make.</p>
<p>Supposedly “sophisticated investors” can do whatever they want to do, so long as it’s not expressly fraudulent or otherwise illegal. But the average grandmother investing for her grandkids’ college needs Federal Protection. Like “Social Security”, the concept of “Security” in the “Securities and Exchange Commission” is essentially a matter of “Trust us, We’re the Government.”</p>
<p>SEC Registration Statements require, prior to sale of any debt or equity instrument to the public, disclosure of all a companies’ assets and liabilities along with the qualifications of its officers and directors, and more.</p>
<p>Nobody outside of the law firms who prepare such things and SEC staff, would ever read this, but preparing the registration would bring CWT millions of dollars. </p>
<p>Excel Mortgage, however, was not selling stock in itself as an enterprise or an entity: it was selling a pooled collection of utterly unrelated and unconnected and barely similar promissory notes with contingent interests in, and access to, equity ownership of real property owned by 1500 different people and subject to 1500 separate notes and mortgages.</p>
<p><strong>1993 &#8211; Anomalies, and Questions, Emerge</strong></p>
<p>Who was to supervise its operation after “Registration”? What coherence did this “enterprise” have ASIDE FROM the Registration Statement? Would anyone ever recognize it as a “business?” If so, how and why? Lincoln was puzzled and perplexed, and not satisfied with any of the answers he was getting.</p>
<p>The SEC did not appear to inquire into post-issuance management or maintenance of the pool of assets. Once “securitized” the notes would still be handled by individual originators or assigned to servicers. Lincoln asked “what was there left to be assigned or handled once the notes and mortgages were pooled?”</p>
<p>The SEC is charged with protecting small individuals and the corporate investor.</p>
<p>The SEC is expected to be involved in examining and making inquiries about a company’s claims for potential and predictions of earnings or profitability.</p>
<p>On what opinion or data would these be based for the Excel Mortgage Pool, since there weren&#8217;t any?</p>
<p>The opinions used were based on the “normal statistical performance of similarly credit rated and similarly valued mortgages in similar markets from studies of a group at MIT Sloan School of Management headed by a then no-name professor Frank J. Fabozzi. Fabozzi, with close ties to the Bank of New York, was also among the occasional Night walkers at Cadwalader.</p>
<p>The process of preparing an SEC registration statement is a gold-mine for lawyers inclined to highly detailed work. Such a process for registration can normally require Lincoln said, over a thousand individual revisions. The Excel Mortgage registration would be subject to over 2,000 revisions, but in all this there was still no attention given to claims of ownership, transfer of title, the laws of agency and fiduciary duty of managers, any of the concerns which normally plague the corporate world and frame the concern of SEC examiners and securities lawyers.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s In It for CWT?</strong></p>
<p>The careers of young associates, and even older partners, at firms such as Cadwalader, Wickersham, &#038; Taft, Chadbourne &#038; Park, Sullivan &#038; Cromwell, or Skadden, Arps, depend upon work measured in billable hours. Cadwalader had a “billing goal” of multiple millions of dollars for the Excel Mortgage registration project.</p>
<p>Lincoln recalls three relevant details:</p>
<p>First, the firm was never able to reach it’s own goal of billable hours by the time the project was complete.</p>
<p>Second, the firm sent constant “internal memoranda” by e-mail to all employees, down to the lowliest legal secretaries and paralegals, to work harder and BILL MORE HOURS. It was simply inconceivable that Cadwalader might have to refund any part of enormous retainer paid for the Excel Mortgage, SEC Registration Statement project. The money for this had all been advanced by BNY, who counted on Cadwalader to do the job which needed to be done.</p>
<p>Third, the practical purpose of any billable hours stood quite above and beyond any possibility of doubt or question. In fact, any and all billings, however described, so long as they were assigned to the Excel Mortgage Registration Statement Account, were welcomed.</p>
<p>Lincoln was therefore able to unleash his curiosity, delving late at night after hours into issues which ranged far, far afield from the environmental history, condition, and culturally or historically significant use or contents of the subject properties.</p>
<p>Despite some losses during the 2007-2008, CWT was in 1993-1994, and remains today, the top firm representing the creators and implementing the designs of “structure finance and derivative securitization” world wide. Lincoln wanted to understand what he was doing, and what he was involved in creating. The more he found out, the more troubled he became.</p>
<p>As an entry-level associate at Cadwalader Lincoln received his own office and secretary and paralegal. Little time was spent interacting with others in the office. A quick question might be asked but friends did not come quickly. Each associate knew what mattered was the hours billed, and friendly socialization was hard to itemize even on the Cadwalader charts. Hanging over the heads of all new associates was the goal of “making partner.”</p>
<p>As an anthropologist, Lincoln saw immediately the subculture of the law firm had its own standards, values, and mandates. The firm had high standards for dress which included ties which remained in place all day, regulations for tie clips or tie pins and cufflinks and belts and, of course, shoes, whether white or “normal.”</p>
<p>Standards for women included skirts below the knee and mandated the length for sleeves and the height of necklines and collars. Even the length of hair, for women, was described and outlined in the firm guide, although one paralegal from the litigation department was granted a special exemption, for cause. Known to and noted by everyone in the firm, for his ponytail and paisley shirts, the associate was hired from SDS in California as “our eyes and ears to the lower classes,” as the senior partners consistently and uniformly described him.</p>
<p>Lincoln, as an undergraduate, had twice been voted, “best dressed man on campus”, but the whole Cadwalader atmospheric ethos of bloodless conformity, as noted above, was for him one of stifling suffocation.</p>
<p>The anomalies which began to intrude on Lincoln&#8217;s consciousness during his late hours trying to understand the “entity” being sold almost as if it were a company or entity, without actually being one, became an obsession. At first, this lead only to more billable hours, but the trip down the rabbit hole became increasingly disconcerting.</p>
<p>All questions of real value or reasonable expectations, lead the inquirer to the Bank of New York’s Heart, ending any questions.</p>
<p><strong>The Disconnect between Law and Derivatives</strong></p>
<p>Lincoln’s law school classes, under the University of Chicago’s Andrew M. Rosenfield, William Landes, Geoffrey Parsons Miller, and Richard A. Posner, and from his further and ongoing research as a Law Clerk with Ryskamp and now at Cadwalader, had considered the question of real value and reasonable expectations.</p>
<p>Issuing and selling securities, debt or equity, takes place when a company, or group of people who have control over assets they planned to use to make money, or with which they were already doing something generally profitable, or wanted to raise new capital and/or liquidate their ownership and interests in an ongoing and successful venture.</p>
<p>This did not come close to describing what Bank of New York had underwritten for Cadwalader to prepare for Excel Mortgage.</p>
<p>This SEC Registration Statement gave birth to new type of “debt-equity-derivative debt instrument” which had none of the elements or characteristics of a traditional enterprise at all. It was PAPER MADE FROM PAPER, SECURED BY PAPER.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Excel Mortgage Bond, which was soon to be popped onto the market with an SEC certification of Federal conformity was a creation of the lawyers, by the lawyers, for the lawyers.</p>
<p>As one of the most senior associates, now firm Chairman, Christopher White explained to Lincoln when he asked him, “Who will own the interests in these notes once they are securitized?” He grinned boyishly from ear-to-ear and said, “we will, because everyone will have to pay us to tell them.”</p>
<p>Without any unifying manager or common owner for these properties, the pool of notes struck Lincoln as like nothing so much as “res nullius” in Ancient Roman Law&#8212;the legal category of “property belonging to no one”, e.g. virgin forests, wild beasts and undomesticated fur and game animals of every kind, the un-owned and un-ownable creatures of the deep.</p>
<p>Excel Mortgage was going to pool all these “derivative” real estate mortgage interests, whose only commonalities marking them as similar were the price, promissory note, range, size and “single-family home-residential” nature of the properties, and the credit or FICO scores of the owners.</p>
<p>Having “pooled” these “cherry picked” assets, Excel was going to create a strange creature without an owner until either default or foreclosure moved someone to homestead these unownable notes back to control and “ownership” again.</p>
<p>In essence, the concept was, “everything belongs to everyone in common” and “debt is not individual but collective.”No one owes his or her debt to any person, but everyone owes it to everyone to pay. This concept seemed, even to Lincoln in 1994, strangely reminiscent of Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World.”</p>
<p>The Excel Mortgage Bond to be securitized reflected an artificial “derivative” interests in a non-coherent, uncontrolled mass of wealth, which could and would have to be tamed individually, just like hunting the wild game of the woods.</p>
<p>There would be only a pretense of relationship between the notes originated and the notes collected upon.</p>
<p>There was no one to oversee the transfers, no one to audit the exchanges of values; there were quite simply no responsible parties anymore than anyone can take charge of wheat chaff thrown into the wind or the by-products of a paper mill dumped into a river, yet these “derivative by-products” were being STRUCTURED into something said to have value.</p>
<p>Around 1500 or 2000 properties had been collected together and placed in a basket or pool. But no single plan of real estate development or construction or sales was involved, nor was any contemplated. Nothing joined these properties as a class. Most were not new, but merely resales.</p>
<p><strong>Raising the Issues</strong></p>
<p>Lincoln dug in further, producing and circulating to all his fellow associates and the senior partners at Cadwalader his own memoranda: lengthy studies and analysis on issues such as the fiduciary obligations in the Law of Agency.</p>
<p>Fiduciary responsibility of issuers of securities to purchasers, holder in due course doctrine, implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing between parties to a contract, privity of contract itself, and commercial paper doctrines such as endorsement and ownership as holder, and the comparative rights and priorities of “naked” holders vs. “perfected” holders.</p>
<p>As Lincoln’s months stretched out among the whirring circular brushes which polished the green and white marble floors of CWT, he spent more-and-more time with the partners of real estate department, which seemed to understand his worries and concerns better than others, certainly better than the Fourth or Fifth year associate in charge of coordinating the Excel Mortgage Project who kept explaining “this is my road to partner; if I can finish this and make it happen, I won’t have to worry about how to live on these lousy six figure salaries anymore, I’ll finally be making millions, and that’s why we all came here, isn’t it?”</p>
<p><strong>Questions Find Answers</strong></p>
<p>Since it was not why Lincoln had arrived at 100 Maiden Lane this presented a dead end for him.</p>
<p>The real estate connection, and an aborted plan to open a CWT office in California, permitted him to compare the Excel Mortgage project with another, more traditional real estate development Sacramento, California.</p>
<p>An extremely prominent CWT client based in Los Angeles was complaining and encountering major problems because of a parallel but separate and distinct set of misapplications of the law of agency, fiduciary duty, and obligation, also originating from the same historical “Cadwalader Memorandum” on transfer of interests which had triggered the explosion of derivative innovations in the securities realm.</p>
<p>With CWT acting as counsel for an old and distinguished California family and collection of enterprises, the Ahmansons, tracts totaling several dozen suburban “townships” in El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento, Sutter, Yolo, and Yuba Counties had sold by the Ahmanson family to a Japanese firm and retained an “Ahmanson Construction Group.”</p>
<p>The intention was to build a resort in the area for the benefit of the Japanese owners acting as “construction agents.”</p>
<p>Normally construction is performed pursuant to agreements with “independent contractors” who make estimates but are not obligated to continue working if their estimated budgets prove insufficient to complete a project. The Japanese investors were seeking to securitize all the sales in this immense, almost unimaginable project.</p>
<p>Involved, were the Bank of New York, with Cadwalader’s long-time California based H.F. Ahmanson holding Company, parent company both to Ahmanson Construction and the since failed Home Savings of America Bank.</p>
<p>The “construction agency relationship” which Cadwalader had created imposed devastating duties and obligations on Ahmanson. As agents, Ahmanson Construction was obligated to use its own money to achieve the ends of the principal, in this case the Japanese company which had purchased the real estate but woefully underfunded the construction of the vast tracts of homes. Ahmanson could not make a profit or even break even. In effect, they had become slaves to the Japanese and might never be compensated.</p>
<p>Lincoln, having reviewed the facts, pointed out to Stephen Meyer, Richard C. Field, and John McDermott, the partners most closely associated with Ahmanson, that by not only failing to protect Ahmanson, but in fact, selling them into quasi-slavery as agents under a contract without guarantees of adequate funding to execute agency obligations, the firm had made a ghastly mistake amounting to nothing less than legal malpractice. This was a breach of fiduciary duty in and of itself.</p>
<p>Lincoln was told, “This firm has a policy of doing no wrong. Therefore, you are wrong. The firm is never wrong. You should reevaluate your conclusions.”</p>
<p>This happened in 1994, only two and a half years after the sensational October 1991 confirmation hearings for Justice Clarence Thomas. The Paula Jones allegations against the new President Clinton, were beginning. “Sexual harassment” became a great boogie-man haunting law firms all over America.</p>
<p><strong>Consequences are Clarified</strong></p>
<p>After reading his memorandum on the Ahmanson project, these senior partners asked Lincoln to leave the room.</p>
<p>When they called Lincoln back in, they told him, very solemnly,</p>
<p>“you know you need to keep your nose clean around here. We have all received reports that you have taken your secretary Alex to lunch more than once and what’s more you gave Holly, the Senior Secretary in recruitment &#038; personnel, flowers for her birthday and Valentines Day. So just remember: never ever do anything, anything at all, that you would not want to see published on the front page of the New York Times. Anything here can be, you know, and anything will be, at the drop of a pin, because everyone is very sensitive to questions of decorum these days, and, after all, you are a married man.”</p>
<p>Lincoln reports he did not even bother to ask how they happened to think of this only after a three hour meeting concerning the Ahmanson contract of construction agency, when he had never heard about any concerns of this nature before.</p>
<p>At work, Lincoln continued to pile up daunting billable hours doing research on a growing list of issues, each going back to the dissection of the elements of value, which were being “deposited” into the derivative pool. He was determined to understand what was really happening. Why were they doing this?</p>
<p>Confirming what Christopher White had told him before, a Properties Department attorney named Stephen Meyer, advised Lincoln to keep his mouth shut, this happening shortly before Lincoln was asked to resign. Both men had made it clear, in nearly the same words, that Lincoln should be careful about questioning or criticizing firm&#8217;s plan for transforming the economy of the Western World, “this is how things are being done these days. We do because we get to charge everybody. This is how the whole world will be managed by 2020, we have a plan.”</p>
<p>As Lincoln was to discover, there was a plan. A book called “Cadwalader 2020” contained a comprehensive manifesto of how the world would be changed by the year 2020. Unsecuritized individual debt would no longer exist.</p>
<p>During Lincoln’s entire time at CWT, the firm maintained a high level of security over the Excel Mortgage work, work which finally involved everyone at the firm. All who worked at the firm had to submit to a frisk on leaving work. No papers or laptop computers or diskettes, this still the era of 3.5 inch diskettes, were to be taken home or removed from the premises, and no external e-mail was allowed connecting to firm e-mail. All firm e-mail was in fact carefully monitored.</p>
<p>To entirely use up the retainer on the Excel work, Lincoln and all the other first and second year associates found themselves in a large conference room supervised by some of the partners pasting labels on files.</p>
<p>The partners had to review the signature pages before officers of Excel would sign the documents, and the associates were there to prepare and affix signature tabs, saying “sign here, Mr. So-and-So, on to the final pages of Statement before final submission.</p>
<p>Lincoln said it seemed odd to use attorney billable time to prepare, double-check, and verify signature tabs, even on a super important document until you considered the driving desire of CWT to maximize their billable hours.</p>
<p>Billing rates were $150.00 an hour for new associates, $60 – 80 an hour for paralegals, and $40 – 50 an hour for secretaries. On being told that he had failed to bill his secretary’s and paralegals’ time for bringing him after hours meals and snacks, Lincoln asked the senior associate in charge of organizing the Excel Mortgage Project how much the firm billed out for the hourly operators of the automated circular marble floor polishers which whirred seemingly ceaselessly day and night throughout the offices. Epstein just glared at Lincoln silently. Those hours were not billable.</p>
<p>CWT was determined to drain every possible penny from the work done for Excel Mortgage, and did. This appeared to be consistent with the Bank of New York’s plan in financing the project in the first place.</p>
<p>As Lincoln&#8217;s research continued, the business plan being followed by Excel Mortgage also emerged, in all of its complexity and disturbing detail. The company had seen the potential to redefine a debt, recreating it as equity, and equity can be used as collateral for originating and extending more debt, which can be hybridized with contingent interests in an ever expanding pyramid of debt, doubled into equity, doubled into debt…. And again, this was the CWT-BNY plan for perpetual inflation.</p>
<p>There was quite simply no plan other than to pool and securitize the notes to issue X millions of dollars in bonds. These would be sold on the major stock exchanges, generating equity. The equity would be used to extend or originate more money to the borrowing public who then “sell” or give their new notes. This then generates more equity through debt, a constantly pooling and production of derivatives then sell to continue the cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Ponzi Scheme Emerges</strong></p>
<p>After his first month of painful research, it took Charles an additional 6 weeks to figure out and map the nature of the pyramid, another 6 weeks to check his work and accept the results, and then he started writing memoranda, one after the other, each one critiqued by other associates or the senior partners and getting longer and longer.</p>
<p>His first memorandum was entitled “The Law of Fiduciary Duty in Agency.”</p>
<p>His second was “Transfer and acceptance of instruments by endorsement and receipt: who is responsible?”</p>
<p>There were at least four others, the longest of which was over 500 pages.</p>
<p>Lincoln’s conclusion was breathtakingly simple: “merger of identities destroys the identities merged, there is no individual liability for debt in the absence of privity of contract, and no privity of contract without individual identity of contracting parties.”</p>
<p>It was clear from the elated attitude of the Senior Partners that designing and implementing the Excel Registration Statement, as the first IPO of its kind, stood in their minds as their most important contribution to western civilization, as envisioned through the world of “Cadwalader 2020”.</p>
<p>Finally, Lincoln was asked to resign, about six weeks shy of his first anniversary. His questions and concerns had not ended and the Partners were becoming hostile.</p>
<p>Leaving with a not quite “Golden Parachute” consisting of a $50,000 severance payment, he had vocally identified a series of challenges which the management of Cadwalader had no intention of addressing. It was now clear to Lincoln these were not any kind of mistake or oversight.</p>
<p>Lincoln’s final memorandum at Cadwalader opined, perhaps overestimating general knowledge of the law, “no mortgage note included in the Excel mortgage pool will ever be lawfully collected in the event of borrower/credit-debtor default, because the pooling of identities obliterates individual obligations and rights, and discrete transactions lie at the foundation of our system of contract and debt.”</p>
<p>At the meeting where he finally resigned, the Senior partners, perhaps understanding the American public better than Lincoln, said to him, “Who is ever going to notice lack of privity of contract besides you? They teach you all those archaic “Elements of Law” at the University of Chicago, we know all about it, but nobody does business that way anymore. The economy of the future is now, nobody cares about endorsements and signatures anymore, it’s all going to be electronic, anyhow.”</p>
<p>Lincoln responded, “well, then, you’re going to have to change the law.” And the masters of the CWT universe said, “Don’t let the door hit you on your way out, we write the law, we interpret the law, we tell everyone in America what the law means, that’s what we do.</p>
<p><strong>The Price Paid</strong></p>
<p>The next nineteen years of Lincoln’s life have been filled with constant attacks from the legal establishment from directions and in ways which exacted a hideous toll on him and those he loves. He has repeatedly learned what it is to be hated, rejected, despised, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. In those two decades he lost his wife, his birth family, and his son, all his inherited property, including several homes and a gigantic private library and personal collections of fossils, numismatic, painted, and sculptural art, his law licenses in three states and even his own not-at-all-insubstantial investments.</p>
<p>Lincoln notes that, after what can only be called a blessed beginning in life with his loving grandparents supporting him, an exceptional education, and basically a privileged and charmed first three decades of life, his consistent pattern of loss only began when he was 33-34 years with his entry into private law practice at Cadwalader, in what, quite simply should have been “the best of all possible worlds.”</p>
<p>Left with nothing, he refused to quit.</p>
<p>All of these events began after those critical months, less than a year, that he had spent at Cadwalader, Wickersham, &#038; Taft.</p>
<p>As historical events unfolded, parallel to his own life, his worst projections regarding the impact of the new market in mortgage derivatives proved to be frighteningly accurate. Lincoln began to research how the runaway Ponzi Scheme could be halted, and reversed.</p>
<p><strong>A Solution</strong></p>
<p>According to Lincoln, for the past ten years, his life has been entirely shaped by the mortgage crisis and its origin in securitization. The question which, he says, drove him is how private property and integrity of contract could restored in the face of the “New World Order” Plan. This is the plan Lincoln first became aware from the internal firm booklet “Cadwalader 2020,” while he was working at CWT in 1993-1994.</p>
<p>Lincoln believes such restoration is possible. The systemic fraud has not gone unnoticed, as CWT and BNY clearly thought would be the case. Their concern is registering through the rising wave of settlements which are now extinguishing the cases they deem most threatening. These cases are now settling on the courthouse steps for significant amounts and return of the real estate, free and clear of mortgage related liens.</p>
<p>Banks understand the ominous possibilities they face if juries realize what really happened. And today, it is not just Cadwalader. Nearly every major financial law firm in the United States who is involved, directly or indirectly, in the implementation, defense, or coverup of securitization is potentially liable.</p>
<p>This potential for liability makes the settlements paid out by cigarette companies seem like chump change.<br />
As long as such settlements are few and remain outside the view of the courts, the banks are safe. But the moment juries hear the facts, and see the reality, the banks are toast, and they know it.</p>
<p>And here, Lincoln said, is the leverage point from which change can be enacted. More cases must be litigated using the facts so cases won in the light of day can become case law and precedent. The war can be won, but will be costly. This challange requires, along with several lines of attack, the means for funding litigation.</p>
<p>One possible solution is to solicit private direct investment in litigation for individual cases in exchange for a share of the awards by the jury. Another is to design an “anti-derivative derivative” plan which bundles and pools both investments and potential awards, allowing Americans at all income levels to invest in the effort.</p>
<p>For this derivative, investors would understand both the risk and the benefits of investing.</p>
<p>Lincoln&#8217;s team, they know, cannot fund its efforts as the banks do, by an out of control pyramid scheme piling debt on equity to create more debt, but Lincoln sees a certain symmatry achieved by using the weapons created by the originators of the problem against them.</p>
<p>Either solution, Lincoln says, lies directly in the hands of Americans. If the money is available, litigation can go forward. He and the team see a build out across the country, with litigation taking place in every state as attorneys sign on and funds are available.</p>
<p>They have already begun. Lincoln&#8217;s team is now working with homeowners and the currently small number of attorneys willing to litigate. They have no illusions. They are aware they are going up against the most powerful institutions in the world. But they also know that, if they are successful, the crack now forming in the protections constructed by CWT, BNY, and so many others, makes it possible to reverse the ominous trends in the American housing market while proving it is possible to enact accountability for a corrupt establishment and good for the people.</p>
<p>If houses now held by banks go on the market, or are returned to their owners, the heavily inflated prices of homes will drop to its natural market level based on supply and demand. Communities will stabilize, as will the lives of Americans.</p>
<p>The America which emerges from this crisis can be very different. No stability will ever result from the current expectations of perpetual economic growth relying on perpetual inflation and perpetual motion in the market place, and the resultant social instability.</p>
<p>The 99% need to bring the 1% home to live with the rest of us in peace, Lincoln says.</p>
<p>Given the propensity of the legal establishment to go after activist attorneys, Lincoln admits this will not be without risk, but public involvement can help here, too. He remains confident, many will step forward. They did so in 1775 and in other times of crisis in America.</p>
<p>Failing to act, he said, means abandoning Americans to the cartels and monopolies who are responsible for what has happened to our country.</p>
<p>Lincoln and other members of the team believe strongly most attorneys and judges, when asked to make a choice in the light of day, will do the right thing.</p>
<p>The effort has already begin in New Jersey. Right now he has a case in motion in the Garden State, just across the river from Manhattan, where Cadwalader still holds sway at the ominously named “One World Financial Center.”</p>
<p>Now, they are looking for more attorneys who love and respect the law, and investors who know what matters most and want to make a difference. His website is, <a href="http://homeownersjustice.com">homeownersjustice.com</a>.</p>

<p>No doubt you have heard about the War on Drugs, the War on Terror and the War on Happiness. However, you may not be familiar with the War on God, possibly because it would be an unpopular war to discuss publicly. By the “War on God” (definition) we mean the collection of strategies, methods and techniques which have the combined effect of preventing or seriously hampering the efforts of individuals to seek or achieve legitimate Spiritual enlightenment and the Soul’s eventual return to God.</p>
<p>The War on God is an ancient war. While the United States and other countries play an active role in this war today, they definitely did not initiate the war. If you want to use the Christian bible as a reference, you could argue that the War on God began shortly after man was created and rejected God in favor of Satan. Clearly, in some form, the War on God has existed throughout human history.</p>
<p>Today, the United States has effectively broken off diplomatic relations with God. The oligarchs who run the country never physically die and so their souls stay on Earth. Apparently, the United States actually believes that its technology, occult knowledge and black magic skills place it in a position which is superior to God.</p>
<p>We know from whistleblowers like David Morehouse that the United States sponsors and trains a cult of psychics to carry out psychic espionage (remote viewing) and also assassinations using psychic black magic techniques. According to clips of his various interviews on YouTube, it was the training in psychic assassinations which caused Morehouse to become disillusioned, quit the secret program and blow the whistle on the operation. Other countries may well operate similar programs but the details will remain unknown until someone defects and exposes them.</p>
<p>The leaders of the United States have always worshiped Satan. The United States was founded by a cult of Satanists known as the Masons and remains under control of that cult today. By rebranding their cult as a nation state, the cult created the appearance of legitimacy. Cult secrets simply transitioned to state secrets. Cult threats to kill anyone telling their secrets transitioned to the crimes of treason and espionage.</p>
<p>Nothing really changed except for the rebranding from a cult to a government. Today, essentially all members of the CIA, NSA and NASA are Masons. All US presidents have been Masons with the two exceptions of Abraham Lincoln and John Kennedy who were both assassinated.</p>
<p>The term “national security” refers to the security of the cult and not to the security of the general population. The Masonic motto is <em>“If you are not one of us, you are nothing”</em>. The cult exists only to enrich itself.</p>
<div><img alt="Only two US presidents weren’t Masons, Abraham Lincoln and John Kennedy. Both assassinated." src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Lincoln-Kennedy.jpg" width="300" height="195" /><br />
<em>Only two US presidents weren’t Masons, Abraham Lincoln<br />
and John Kennedy. Both assassinated.</em></p>
</div>
<p>The Masons study and practice the occult. Serious study begins after they take a formal oath of allegiance to Satan at the 30th degree initiation. Basic occult knowledge is neutral and everyone who advances Spiritually learns it. However, Masons seek this knowledge to gain power and control over others as opposed to knowledge for personal advancement. This choice, commonly called the Left Hand Path, places them in opposition to the will of God.</p>
<p>If the Satanists simply wanted to sell their Souls to Satan and mind their own business, one could argue that they had that right because they had free choice. However, the situation is not that simple. The Satanic oligarchs did freely choose to worship Satan. However, they also desire a comfortable life. They don’t want to do any “grunt” work. Therefore, they have enslaved the remainder of humanity and are holding their Souls prisoner on this planet to service their needs. Therefore, if you, as an innocent Soul, ever plan to escape from this place and return to God, it is in your interest to investigate and gain an understanding of this war so that you will have an opportunity to Spiritually evolve. Otherwise, your Soul will remain a prisoner here — lifetime after lifetime — serving the Satanic overlords essentially forever.</p>
<h4>Earth Based Religions</h4>
<p>The phrase <em>Earth Based Religions</em> (definition) refers to religious schools which seek and use knowledge, including occult knowledge, to enhance their experiences during their human lifetimes as opposed to using the same knowledge to foster Spiritual development with the ultimate goal of achieving a stable non-physical Spiritual existence.</p>
<p>Although Pagan religions are usually grouped into this category, a more careful examination would reveal that essentially all mainstream religions are Earth based religions. Mainstream religions make constant references to God and Heaven but never explain exactly what they are talking about. Their books concentrate on historical narratives concerning how people in the past lived and coped with the basic problems of human physical existence. They never give details of any level of Spiritual existence or even any specific hints about what life beyond death will be.</p>
<p>Let’s try an example. Suppose you have never seen a motor vehicle. You have heard vague stories that they exist, but that is all. Then, suddenly, you find yourself behind the wheel of a car on a high speed road like the US interstate system or the A roads in Britain. What would you guess would be your chance of survival? Try less than zero.</p>
<p>Now suppose you physically die. Suddenly, you find yourself in your Astral body. However, no one ever told you that you have an Astral body. It does not operate under the same rules as a physical body does. It is a very pliant and nimble body. It can travel in time to the past or future, access any plane and subplane in the Astral universe and research the absolute accurate and incorruptible records system known as the Akashic Records to name just a few. But, as in the previous example, you never learned how to “drive” it.</p>
<p>You would have done fine on the highway if you had gradually learned to drive a motor vehicle. You would do fine after death if you had some experience and training with your Astral body. However, no one ever taught you. What practical use is any religion that constantly rants about Heaven but offers no practical advice about your life after this life?</p>
<p>This information may have been a guarded secret in the past, but those days are gone. You can research this information to your heart’s content on the internet, locate legitimate Spiritual groups and learn from those who can leave their physical body and explore the non-physical dimensions. But, don’t expect any help from a mainstream church.</p>
<p>You might do well to recall the famous quote attributed to Jesus, <em>“The truth will set you free”</em>. Mainstream churches are large, rich institutions. They did not get that way by “setting people free”. They got that way by terrifying their followers with ridiculous horror stories of what will happen to them if they do not obey their crazy doctrines, stay with them and give them all their money.</p>
<p>Gnostic and other “non-traditional” religions may be Spiritual based as opposed to Earth based. Jesus always reminded everyone that he represented a kingdom <em>“not of this world”</em>. If we had accurate records of his true lectures we would no doubt find practical instructions and information about this “other world”. We don’t have this information because any practical Spiritual teachings he might have given were censored out to create the simplified — but Spiritually sterile — mainstream religions we have today. They are simple to comprehend and follow but will not lead you anywhere except another physical lifetime somewhere on Earth.</p>
<h4>Life Before Technology</h4>
<p>Before technology life was simple. Although existence was hard, the opportunity for Spiritual experiences was greater than today. Consider, for example, all the empty time you would have as, say, a sheep herder. Nothing to do except make sure the sheep kept moving. In this situation, there was ample opportunity for the mind to wander and perhaps contemplate and glimpse other realities.</p>
<p>Also, and perhaps most important, no electric grid existed on the planet. Electric fields appear as solid “matter” in the Astral dimension and so can affect Astral experiences — generally in a negative way. Artificially created electromagnetic waves which blanket the planet today also have subtle and generally negative effects on living creatures.</p>
<p>Pagan groups generally conduct occult rituals outdoors and away from high population areas. When buildings are used, it is desirable that they be made only of wood and assembled without any metal (nails) and, of course, have no electrical wires.</p>
<p>Both good and evil existed before technology as they always have. It was possible to use psychological propaganda to influence and control susceptible masses of people. However, the positive and negative forces were more in balance. It was not possible for a single group to successfully dominate the planet.</p>
<p>Drugs existed in the form of various plants. Adepts learned how to use them to help or harm others. People with developed psychic abilities existed as they always have and white and black occult schools existed. Legitimate Spiritual masters existed.</p>
<p>Some techniques that thrived have essentially become extinct because the population of the planet has devolved. It is next to impossible to successfully teach Tantra (sex yoga), because today’s generation is incapable of the required level of self control. Classic Tibetan yoga techniques are still taught in isolated areas, but the masters — for good reason — will no longer consider trusting outsiders.</p>
<h4>Information Control Techniques</h4>
<p>Information control is essential for protecting the integrity of a compartment. People are held as slaves by constructing an information box which holds the slaves in an information prison. As long as the “walls” of the compartment remain impenetrable, the compartment — or belief system — will be stable and no slave will escape.</p>
<p>Considerable energy is required to achieve this. Those assigned to protect the walls obviously know that the compartment is an intellectual illusion. Therefore, they must be sworn to secrecy and intimidated in such a way that they will not compromise the integrity of the compartment. It only takes one “leak” to initiate a chain of events which could collapse the compartment and so allow the slaves to escape.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the Snowden leaks. One person sharing knowledge has totally destroyed the illusion of privacy that most people had accepted as fact. It will not be possible to reconstruct this illusion. The compartment has collapsed.</p>
<p>Similar principles apply in the Spiritual spectrum. Because of the characteristics of the human bodies in use on this planet, most people do not retain any conscious memory of events before they were born. This is not universally true. Life forms on many other planets retain the memories of previous existences. Because humans generally do not have this recall, they are easily enslaved and can be conditioned to believe most anything.</p>
<p>To maintain a state of Spiritual ignorance it is important to institute methods which will prevent people from realizing that they are actually Souls experiencing a constructed illusion. People somehow reaching this state, sometimes referred to as “self realization”, will no longer respond to establishment propaganda and are generally considered a threat to the current social order.</p>
<p>The easiest and most direct method to achieve a stable slave population is simply not to talk about anything even vaguely esoteric. For example, how often have you heard the words <em>astral</em>, <em>chakra</em> or <em>aura</em> mentioned on a mainstream TV channel?</p>
<p>Most people will then likely “remain asleep” throughout their entire lifetime and will be no problem. Unfortunately, people have a natural desire — even though it may be an unconscious desire — to Spiritually evolve. It is, after all, the true purpose of human existence.</p>
<p>When someone tries to break away from the contrived illusions more direct methods are needed to return the slave to a state of ignorance. Today, various methods which cause brain damage — generally performed by psychiatrists — are used to negate any success in Spiritual evolution and return the slave to a state of vacant contentment.</p>
<h4>Diversions and Techniques Promoting Inaction</h4>
<p>The simplest and most effective diversionary technique is to promote <em>scientific atheism</em>and <em>darwinian evolutionary philosophy</em> as established fact. If you can get someone to buy into this philosophy, their fate is sealed. Even if they experience some contact with another dimension, such as an out-of-body experience, they will follow their programming, dismiss the experience as a delusion and refuse to investigate further. When they die, they will be totally lost and confused, flounder around on some lower Astral plane and eventually reincarnate just as Spiritually ignorant as before.</p>
<p>A side effect of accepting scientific atheism, which totally cripples Spiritual progress, is the acceptance of suicide as a way out of life’s problems. Suicide becomes a learned reaction. Consequently, when the Soul is sent back into another physical lifetime, it is likely to commit suicide again when faced with some unpleasant event. It never learns, and this cycle can repeat essentially indefinitely. Dealing with this is one of the most difficult problems faced by the administrators who work on the Astral planes.</p>
<p>For those who want more than scientific atheism, there is mainstream garden variety religion. Mainstream Christianity has developed a clever stonewalling technique that has worked to promote inaction for thousands of years. This technique is centered upon the argument that no one can make any progress until Jesus returns to show the way. In the meantime, people should just do nothing and wait. The effect of this is essentially the same as scientific atheism. No Spiritual progress is made.</p>
<p>Schemes designed to waste time are common. One really off the wall example is the decision in Syria to prohibit vacuum cleaners and standard flat brooms in homes. “Witch type” brooms consisting of a circular straw bundle are allowed. Surely there must be a good reason to keep these terrorist weapons out of the reach of the typical Syrian housewife. The official reason is to make basic housework as difficult and time consuming as possible so as to prevent the woman from having any free idle time which, if allowed, could lead to the emergence of “immoral thoughts”. Perfectly logical!</p>
<p>In the western world, complex bureaucracies seem to be deliberately designed to make the path to whatever you want as difficult as possible. Here the apparent motive is to prevent the acquisition of enough free time for any independent thought process. There are just not enough hours in a day to allow for any quiet contemplation of anything.</p>
<p>“Blank time” is always reported as a factor in the development of Spiritual figures. Time alone in the wilderness, time spent meditating alone in some isolated cave or at least periods of dedicated quiet time somewhere figure prominently in historical accounts of these people.</p>
<p>You may know or have heard of kids who spend all their waking hours playing interactive role model video games with other kids on the internet. They eat meals by the computer and never leave except to briefly sleep before returning to the all important game. Their entire life is spent in an imaginary reality. You may want to consider that your “real” life may not be all that different. You play a role. Your attributes are fixed by what society expects based upon that role. You can’t change, because others would notice. Your concept of the world beyond your little world is determined by what you see on TV. Daily, you receive your “fix” of carefully choreographed “programming” which appears unusually coherent because, as you may not know or fully comprehend, everything on TV is controlled by a few corporations and all of them are loyal to the official government party line. If you somehow had the opportunity to break from this structured “game” you play from day to day — say, the opportunity to visit other countries and see other cultures — you would likely realize that your existence has not been that much different from the kid addicted to a computer game. You would find that the actual “real” world had very little relationship to the world you had been conditioned to believe existed.</p>
<h4>Chemical Control Techniques</h4>
<blockquote><p><em>“With the use of chemical brain-control agents it may be possible to control the individual and the masses and to do this unobtrusively and without the active cooperation of the victims — not a question for the future — it is here”.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This is a quote from the book by Edgar Cayce titled <em>Edgar Cayce on Atlantis</em>. There are references to Dr. Robert Galbraith Heath, and this book bears a copyright date of 1968. The book cites an interview that Heath gave to a newspaper called <em>The Virginia Lighthouse</em> and cites the above statement made by him on November 20, 1966. Heath founded the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at Tulane University, New Orleans, in 1949 and remained its Chairman until 1980.</p>
<p>During this period, Tulane University actively participated in the CIA mind control project known as MK Ultra [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote1" name="fn1">1</a>]. Also, during this period, Tulane became an active member of the secret Institute for Defense Analyses, or IDA, a corporation whose only client is the US government. Heath reportedly performed many experiments there involving electrical stimulation of the brain via surgically implanted electrodes. This work was reportedly partially financed by the CIA and the US military. Heath is now “officially” [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote11" name="fn11">11</a>] deceased.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/skychem_dees-300x266.jpg" width="300" height="266" />You have been drugged since you were conceived — before you were even born. Your mother was drugged. Soon after birth, you were injected with mercury containing vaccines. And the systematic process of poisoning you never stopped.</p>
<p>By some estimates at least eighty percent of the food in the average supermarket is poison either because it is genetically modified or laced with pesticides and other additives. Even the air is poison now because of geoengineering chemicals sprayed into the upper atmosphere.</p>
<p>It should be noted that things are different in the separate but parallel world of the elite. The Max Keiser show [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote12" name="fn12">12</a>] discussed the secret gardens in Japan. These gardens are surrounded by high walls and guarded by the military. They produce the food for the ruling elite. Every plant in the garden has its own health certificate certifying that is pure, healthy and not genetically modified. Obviously, every developed country must have a similar secret supply chain of legitimate food for its ruling class. Certainly the elite know better than anyone that the food supply for the ordinary people is poison. They’re not fools. They wouldn’t touch the stuff.</p>
<p>Vaccines used for the elite are prepared without the mercury and other toxic additives found in vaccines given to the ordinary people.</p>
<p>Various agents — mainly from plants — have always existed which could be used by those aware of them to harm others or control people by altering their state of consciousness. However, only recently has it become practical to wreck the health of essentially everyone on the planet at the same time. Genetic modification of plants and other life forms used for food has made this possible. Now, quietly, people throughout the world can be sterilized, crippled with serious health problems or even killed by altering the genetic makeup of the food supply. Ordinary people remain generally ignorant of the fact that this awesome power exists and is presently being used against them.</p>
<p>Mind control has become a science. You can’t major in it in college because this science is essentially entirely secret. The United States and other countries have spent the equivalent of billions of US dollars investigating and perfecting mind control.</p>
<p>Many secret research projects using unsuspecting or perhaps kidnapped people — some of whom were killed — have been conducted in the past and continue today. We only know about a very few of these projects such as MK Ultra, MK Naomi and Project Other. Even in these projects, specific details are sketchy. From these experiments, practical techniques for creating manchurian candidates and implanting created false personalities and identities have been developed and are in common use today within the secret communities.</p>
<p>Everyone has likely been the victim of some degree of mind control to some extent. Chemical weapons designed to mentally cripple people and render them drooling idiots are freely sold as prescription drugs in drugstores and are available to doctors to use as they please.</p>
<p>The lives of many kids are destroyed by these “drugs” because they have no ability to resist and their parents are ignorant and believe doctors can “do no harm”. Actually, today’s doctors are agents of the state. Many have top secret clearances and embrace classic Nazi philosophies such as eugenics. Their function is to watch you and make sure you “die appropriately” so as not to burden society. Anything they learn about you and anything you tell them is freely available to anyone in the intelligence community who is curious about you.</p>
<p>Only members of the super elite who are entitled to access top secret medicine will receive legitimate supportive medical care. Ordinary people will be deliberately allowed to die even though doctors with top secret clearances know of effective treatments which would cure them but which are classified and reserved for the chosen elite.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as an incurable disease any more. All the cures have been discovered. If you die, it is because you are not considered important enough to live and not because the cure does not exist.</p>
<p>Common sense should suggest to you that the lives of the elite have statistically different characteristics. For example, members of congress do not live sheltered lives. They work in close quarters and travel extensively both locally and internationally. They are always hanging out with prostitutes as well as playing with the young congressional pages.</p>
<p>Washington D.C. is reported to have more brothels than fast food joints. Strangely, however, these people do not get sick. Have you ever heard that congress had to shut down because everyone was coming down with some infection. It happens in other close populations, so what would make them exempt?</p>
<h4>Understanding Astral Damage</h4>
<p>Living things have an Astral component. For example, when you cut a leaf and then see the complete leaf on a Kirlian photo you are viewing the Astral component which was unaffected by cutting the physical component because it does not exist in the physical dimension.</p>
<p>Over one hundred years ago, practical techniques for viewing the human Aura were developed by Walter J. Kilner [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote4" name="fn4">4</a>]. The original technique used dicyanin dye and a later technique used special glasses. You can’t find either one today. In his research, Kilner was able to demonstrate that defects in the human Aura appeared before some corresponding disease manifested in the physical body.</p>
<p>Therefore, he was able to detect and prevent an adverse physical condition <em>before</em> it ever physically materialized. So, you ask, why don’t we have this marvelous medical technique available today? Well, we do. It is in use in top secret medicine. However, only the approved elite now have access to it. The information has been removed from public knowledge and classified.</p>
<p>In conventional allopathic medicine, which is based upon scientific atheism and sold to the general public, there is officially no such thing as an Astral body. Conventional medicine denies the existence of anything beyond the physical dimension. Since the Astral body officially does not exist, it is not recognized as a crime to deliberately harm it.</p>
<p>Damage to the Astral body can be compared to damage to the physical body. If you punch holes in the physical body by cutting it, shooting bullets at it or whatever, blood runs out and germs get in. If you cause enough damage, the body dies. Astral bodies do not die, but can suffer critical energy losses. Similar to physical bodies, punching holes in the Astral body allows essential energy to escape and harmful energies to enter.</p>
<p>There are many events which can harm your Astral body. It is in your interest to understand these events because your Astral body will be your primary body when your physical body dies. If it has been damaged, you will be at a severe disadvantage. The chosen elite have perfect Auras because they can use the Aura balancing machines available to them at any top secret medicine provider. However, you cannot.</p>
<p>Also, the ruling elite seem to take some delight in causing harm to the “ordinary” people. Consequently, many drugs, food additives, GMO foods and industrial chemicals found in the environment cause Astral damage. Chemicals recognized as poisons and banned in other countries can be freely added to foods given to ordinary people in the US.</p>
<p>Obviously, there must exist a secret supply chain of safe food and water which is available to the chosen since they know of the contamination and certainly would not want to harm themselves or their friends.</p>
<p>There are ways to closely duplicate the secret techniques available only to the elite. If you can see auras or can find a reputable psychic who can, you can approximate the techniques developed by Kilner and available to everyone over a hundred years ago. Although the secret aura balancing machines are more accurate, a competent psychic healer can do the same thing. Actually, since psychics have always existed, similar techniques have been available throughout the ages to those who were aware.</p>
<h4>Fluoride</h4>
<p>The concept of adding fluoride to drinking water for the purpose of mind control is said to have originated in the 1930′s as a result of collaboration between German and Russian scientists [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote2" name="fn2">2</a>]. Sodium fluoride was originally used and was found to cause a “mild lobotomy” in people who consumed small quantities. The effects were considered to be non reversible after one year of continuous use of the tainted water. Hitler added sodium fluoride to the water in his concentration camps to make the prisoners docile and cooperative as they waited for death.</p>
<p>Sodium fluoride (NaF) is used today in personal products like toothpaste. To poison the water supply of an entire country with sodium fluoride would be expensive. However, it just so happens that there is a waste product created during the manufacture of phosphate fertilizers, Fluorosilicic acid (H<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>), which is classified as hazardous waste and would be expensive to dispose of under EPA guidelines.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/flor_dees-300x256.jpg" width="300" height="256" />There is lots of this stuff available. This is the poison added to the public water supply in the US and some other countries. It is actually economical for industry because they don’t have to pay for hazardous waste disposal. They just pump it into the public water supply.</p>
<p>In the human body, fluoride has an affinity for the pineal gland in the brain. The pineal gland is associated with the “third eye”. Everyone has this third eye, but few are aware of it or know how to activate and use it.</p>
<p>Although the pineal gland is part of the physical body, the associated third eye is part of the Astral body and so is invisible in the physical dimension. The third eye allows you to see and communicate with the non-physical dimensions while fully awake and functioning in the physical dimension. So, you could see and carry on a conversation with someone in the physical dimension while invisibly also viewing and communicating with some entity on another plane of existence.</p>
<p>The standard Christian bible refers to the third eye with the phrase, <em>“If thy eye be single thy whole body will be filled with light”</em>. However, only students of mysticism would recognize the true meaning of this quote.</p>
<p>Obviously, having this ability would be a threat to the security of any totalitarian society. Poisoning with fluoride destroys this ability and so solves that problem. Literature is available if you wish more detailed information. Simply search using the phrase “fluoride third eye”.</p>
<p>On the chance that fluoride in the water is not sufficient to destroy any psychic abilities you may have, there are more aggressive ways to get fluoride into your brain. Here are some structural models of popular psychiatric drugs:</p>
<div align="center">
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Fluphenazine.jpg" width="200" height="108" /><br />

<em>Trifluoperazine</em></p>
</div>
<p>Notice that the element Fluorine (symbolized by its standard chemical symbol “F”) figures prominently in all these compounds.</p>
<p>These drugs are used to cause “chemical lobotomy”. By blocking communication channels with the higher levels of the human brain, they effectively convert the victim into a lower form of animal. Lower animals do not have the frontal lobes possessed by humans. That is what makes humans special. Disabling the frontal lobes effectively transforms a natural human being into, basically, a docile and obedient house pet which can be trained like a dog.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Fluorine also figures prominently in Sarin nerve gas.</p>
<div align="center">

<h4>They All Drink From the Same Trough</h4>
<p>If you casually look out upon the institutions of the world, it may appear to you that they are independent, discrete entities. However, they are not. They are all components of a collective which has successfully hidden its existence and true nature from the general population for generations.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the media in the US. Although it may appear to you that there are thousands of independent sources reporting “news”, 90% of all media is controlled by six corporations. They are General Electric, News-Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time-Warner and CBS.</p>
<p>In the US, people believe they are protected from tyranny by the concept of “separation of powers” — that the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government are staffed by independent thinkers who “check and balance” each other. This is also a deception.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/horns_dees-300x266.jpg" width="300" height="266" />Once a year, at the end of July, there is a secret gathering on private property in the redwood forest of California called the Bohemian Grove. Although this annual meeting has been going on for over one hundred years, it is only during the last several years that outsiders have begun to learn of its existence. The only reason they have is because of the internet and independent journalism. Leaders from the mainstream media are all members of this secret club and so never even report its existence.</p>
<p>Who else goes to this annual secret “party”? Well, for want of a better name, we will call them the “Trusted Satanists”. They are the leaders of all the major corporations, banks and representatives from all the major branches of the US government as well as foreign governments.</p>
<p>Although these men outwardly support the concept of capitalism for the masses, this elite group, among themselves, are perhaps best described as “rich socialists”. Only men are allowed. For recreation, a stable of prostitutes — both male and female — are kept nearby off-site. The male prostitutes could theoretically enter the Grove.</p>
<p>The “party” begins with a Satanic ritual called “Cremation of Care” (i.e., “we don’t care”) which features the burning of a coffin at the base of a huge statue of an owl. Walter Cronkite reportedly was the official announcer at the grove until his death.</p>
<p>A secretly filmed video of this event is available on YouTube. It is supposed to be a “simulated” child sacrifice. However, since the CIA, FBI and NSA attend the ritual, who is going to complain on the chance it is a real sacrifice of a human child? After all, they are all trusted Satanists.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rep_flag.png" width="100" />Most attendees from the United States are members of the Republican party. This is completely predictable in view of the fact that the US Republican party flaunts its affiliation with the “dark side” by prominently using the inverted star symbol on its official logo.</p>
<p>During the two week period, corporate leaders, the “independent” government regulators who supposedly keep corporations honest, the leaders from the executive, legislative and judicial branches of US government who are supposed to be “checking and balancing” each other, as well as the media moguls who we “trust” to report the truth, are all running around naked in the woods — pissing on the trees, playing with each other, and the male prostitutes as well as the off-site female prostitutes, and “having discussions”.</p>
<p>Well, what are they “having discussions” about? They are discussing what they plan to do with “their world”. The Manhattan Project to develop the first atomic bomb was reportedly planned at one of these discussions years ago. What about you? What about your future? What about any expectation of happiness you may have? Well, you see, you “don’t need to know”. Remember, <em>“If you are not one of us, you are nothing”</em>.</p>
<h4>Blueprints For the New World</h4>
<p><strong><em>Overview</em></strong></p>
<p>If this link [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote7" name="fn7">7</a>] is still active, it would be in your interest to read through it. This document is a transcript of a speech given by one of the insiders in the year 1969. He boldly states,<em>“Everything is in place and no one can stop us now”</em>.</p>
<p>The article details how people (“people” means the slave class who are “nothing”; recall: <em>“If you are not one of us, you are nothing”</em>) will just have to get used to changes such needing permission to have children, accepting mandated euthanasia as the law and total surveillance. Essentially all goals are now achieved, although some still remain guarded secrets.</p>
<p>The 1960′s was the period when physical death was eliminated. Of course, this “privilege” is only available to the select Satanic oligarchs. Effective cures for all diseases were also developed. The speaker [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote7" name="fn7">7</a>] states that the cures are on file in the Rockefeller Institute. Of course, most are classified and only available to the chosen elite.</p>
<p><strong><em>Infrastructure</em></strong></p>
<p>The PBS documentary, <em>Top Secret America</em> [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote8" name="fn8">8</a>], presents a good overview of the secret world of the elite. You may think no one is paying attention to the infrastructure in America because streets are in disrepair and bridges are falling down. However, you would be wrong. A tremendous amount of money is being spent on infrastructure in America — for the chosen elite. You will never see it and you will have no need for the decaying bridges and streets because you won’t be around to use them. You, as well as 90+ percent of the current population, will be killed in the “Great Culling”.</p>
<p>The new infrastructure is quite elaborate as the documentary explains. It consists of thousands of buildings which have a few stories visible above ground but which then extend for 90+ stories underground. All amenities are available within these secret structures which are basically self-sufficient.</p>
<p>It is important for the buildings to reach deep underground so that the lower levels can connect to the secret underground transport network. This network is global and provides safe high speed transport for the elite. Whenever the network crosses a tectonic plate, massive amounts of silicone are used to allow the transport tunnel to flex as needed. The network has access points in all countries. However, these points remain secret in countries which have yet to be subdued and co-opted into the new world order.</p>
<p><strong><em>NWO Enabling Documents</em></strong></p>
<p>The treaty known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership appears to be the formal enabling document for the new world. The actual document is secret and only high level corporate executives and politicians are allowed to see it.</p>
<p>Even after the treaty goes into force, its contents will remain secret. Because, in the United States, treaties must be openly debated in congress, the treaty is being called an “agreement” to circumvent the law and keep its contents secret. However, some details have become known.</p>
<p>Although the planet is officially divided into “sovereign” countries, it is overlaid with a network of transnational corporations. This network basically forms a parallel government which encircles the globe. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is designed to cause any country which signs on to surrender its national sovereignty to a secret committee composed of corporate executives. This committee can then alter the constitution and laws of any country which has accepted the treaty as suits their whim. There will be no appeal against this.</p>
<p>Under the treaty, there will be only one purpose to human life. That purpose will be to maximize the profits of the cabal of transnational corporations which will now be essentially a single global corporation in absolute control of the world. This effectively institutionalizes the new world order.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you? Well, to begin with, there can be no retirement. Paying for retirement would negatively impact corporate profits. So, if you can’t work, you will be killed. Taking care of sick people would also drain corporate profits. It would be more profitable just to kill the sick and replace them with young, healthy slaves. Disabilities — forget it — disabled kids will never make it out of the womb alive.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reeducation</em></strong></p>
<p>To come into compliance with the philosophy of the new world, people will need to be reeducated. Military instruction documents [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote6" name="fn6">6</a>] are already teaching that the Founding Fathers of the United States were extremists and anyone who thinks like them would not be suited for today’s military.</p>
<p>Well, what did these radical extremists think?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, these principles are not compatible with the new world. The idea of a “Creator” conflicts with the official doctrine of Evolution. We can’t have that. People must accept that they and the universe they live in is simply an “accident”.</p>
<p>People are already realizing that Liberty and Happiness are gone. They know now that they live under constant surveillance and their lives get worse year after year. How about the right to Life? Can’t have that. People need to be reeducated to believe that it is their “duty to die” when they are no longer useful to the state (which is now the global corporation).</p>
<p>Of course, the global elite will live physically forever but ordinary people will not know this.</p>
<p>If a world where people are conditioned to want to die and do not want kids but just sleep around for fun sounds vaguely familiar to you, you might recall that this is the future society described in Huxley’s classic novel, <em>Brave New World</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Population Modification</em></strong></p>
<p>Please refer to [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote9" name="fn9">9</a>] as a reference source. Today’s “great thinkers” seem to be coming into agreement that most people are unnecessary and need to be exterminated for the convenience of the elite. Bill Gates, who has now been accepted into the super exclusive Bilderberg group, has reportedly taken the task of exterminating the third world population by giving them “free” vaccinations which will render them sterile.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/hungryman_dees-300x247.jpg" width="300" height="247" />Lots of groups are working on secret sterilization methods. European tests of Monsanto’s GM soybeans on hamsters showed the animals became sterile by the third generation [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote12" name="fn12">12</a>]. A new gene known as <em>Epicyte</em> [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote9" name="fn9">9</a>] is planned to be added to GM corn which will cause immediate sterilization.</p>
<p>Additionally, people are being “eased into” accepting the concept of “after birth abortion”. Intellectuals are trying to get people to accept the argument that living human children under three or perhaps even five years old are really “not people but advanced feotuses”. Since abortion is already legal, a simple change in the definition of “feotus” would allow young kids to be killed at will for any reason.</p>
<p>Another “new thought” gradually being programmed into the young is the pleasure of the “childless lifestyle”. This propaganda seeks to convince people that having kids is too much trouble and they will be happier if they just get sterilized and then run around having lots of sex purely for fun.</p>
<p>These “evolutionary” population control techniques are already in effect. However, the elite likely are not willing to wait several generations to get rid of those they do not need. This brings us to the more direct method commonly called “The Great Culling” which will allow the elite to kill off most of the world’s population quickly.</p>
<p>The most likely method will be the release of new designer viruses for which no one will have any natural immunity. Of course, the elite will all get the classified antidote. Preparations for the disposal of the bodies is already complete and stockpiles of plastic coffins — each designed to hold three bodies and manufactured under government contract by Halliburton — have been photographed and documented. Everything is now in place awaiting the “go” command.</p>
<p><strong><em>Designer Children</em></strong></p>
<p>Some types of designer children have already been approved for “production”. Britain has approved three parent babies [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote10" name="fn10">10</a>] and China has proposed a process to artificially fertilize most of a woman’s eggs and then examine them to determine which is likely to produce a child with the highest IQ. This will be the only selected egg because Chinese women are only allowed to have one child and must then be sterilized.</p>
<p>In the new world where the only purpose of people will be to do slave labor to serve the elite corporate masters, the concept of allowing the existence of children conceived naturally clearly cannot be allowed. There would be an unexceptable chance for some kind of error that could result, for example, in the creation of a being capable of independent thought who might challenge the establishment.</p>
<h4>A man’s true worth is measured by the amount of other people’s happiness that he can possess and destroy</h4>
<p>This is a quote from the docudrama <em>The American Ruling Class</em> [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote5" name="fn5">5</a>]. It is worthy of discussion because it is so prophetic.</p>
<p>The Satanic oligarchs who run this world basically exist and thrive on the misery of others. It is not enough just to use and abuse you — they want to consume your Soul. Your misery and suffering is, essentially, their “food”. It is the source of their energy.</p>
<p>Ordinary innocent Souls are sustained by the life energy which flows from the Creator. However, since the oligarchs hate God, this energy flow is not available to them. So, they essentially survive by consuming the life energy of the innocent Souls they have captured and enslaved.</p>
<p>Ordinary people do not naturally choose to spend their lives in a state of constant war. They have to be somehow coerced into this behavior. Otherwise, they would likely seek a quiet, peaceful life. The atrocities the US and other warmonger nations force their citizens to commit are so contrary to basic human nature that the US loses more soldiers to suicide than it does to the enemy. The once innocent soldiers find that they simply cannot continue to live with what they have become and the memories of the horrors they have caused to others. The Satanic rulers who create wars, of course, have no problem with this.</p>
<p>Promotions within the inner circles of power are based upon how much evil one has done. The more harm you cause to others the greater your respect. You may have noticed that the stock market, which is a measure of the success of the elite, shows gains during periods when the average person is suffering and losses during periods when, somehow, life for the ordinary person seems to improve. The stock market set a new all time high, for example, during the Vietnam War when innocent young kids were being drafted and slaughtered in Vietnam while peaceful protesters at Penn State were executed by government forces for daring to dissent.</p>
<h4>Why You Should Care</h4>
<p>On the low Astral planes you will find people — Souls — who are totally lost and confused and seem to move in slow motion. They do not realize they have died. These “people” are not there because they tore up the Bible or burned the Koran or some other offensive act. They are there simply because it is the best they can do. They are using all of the Spiritual energy they have just to maintain this miserable existence. Whatever activities they engaged in while alive had no Spiritual merit and had no effect on developing or increasing their Spiritual energy level. Since the opportunity to do this ended when they died, they will remain strung out in this condition until they reincarnate again at which point they will have another chance to choose activities which enhance Spiritual energies.</p>
<p>You should care because the things you do and the things you fail to do during your brief life here will affect your existence for millions of years in the future.</p>
<p>The other dimensions operate under exact scientific rules just like this dimension. However, the rules are not the same. Because alternate sources of information are available today — mainly because of the internet — it is in your interest to at least investigate the available literature on Spirituality, energy raising techniques and various first-hand reports from people who have successfully visited the neighboring dimensions.</p>

</div>
<p>On 28 November 1953, at 2 am, a man crashed through a closed window and fell to his death from the 10th floor of the Statler Hotel in New York City. He was identified as Frank Olson, a bacteriologist with the US Army Research Center at Fort Detrick, Maryland. He had fallen from a room he shared with another scientist, Robert Lashbrook. It was ruled a suicide.</p>
<p>Twenty-two years later, in 1975, William Colby, then CIA director, declassified documents that changed the complexion of the case. It was revealed that Olson had actually been an undercover CIA operative at Fort Detrick, and that one week prior to his death, he had been drinking Cointreau at a high-level meeting with scientists at Deep Creek Lodge in rural Maryland. The Cointreau was laced with a large dose of LSD administered by his CIA boss, Sidney Gottlieb. He was then sent to New York with Lashbrook, also with the CIA, to see a psychiatrist because the LSD had induced a psychosis.</p>
<p>It was also revealed that Olson had been part of the top secret CIA program that was known as Project MK-ULTRA, exploring the use of chemicals and <a title="PsyWar: A Short History of the Battle for the Mind" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/06/24/psywar-a-short-history-of-the-battle-for-the-mind/">drugs for purposes of mind control</a>, and bacteriological agents for covert assassination. Olson had been working on ways to deliver anthrax in aerosol form, for use as a weapon. New evidence that came to light, through the persistent efforts of Olson’s son Eric, made the suicide ruling highly suspect.</p>
<p>It turned out that Olson had been labelled a security risk by British intelligence after getting upset witnessing human experimentation on a trip to Frankfurt, Germany the previous summer. Eric Olson now believes that his father was drugged and then murdered to make sure that he didn’t reveal the secrets of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1441499733/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1441499733&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">MK-ULTRA project</a>. Following the 1975 revelations, the government must have felt more than a little guilt about the affair because Olson’s family was given a 17 minute audience with US President Ford, who apologised to them, and they were awarded damages in the amount of $750,000.</p>
<p><strong>Controlling Human Behaviour</strong></p>
<p>The MK-ULTRA program was instituted on 13 April 1953 by CIA Director Allen Dulles, ostensibly to counter the brainwashing techniques of American prisoners being held by the North Koreans during the Korean War, and to duplicate those techniques on enemy prisoners, i.e. the creation of “Manchurian Candidates.” This was the claim used to obtain funding for the project. However, the Prisoner of War brainwashing program was just the tip of the iceberg, and the CIA-sponsored experiments ventured far and wide into areas of Mind Control under the aegis of MK-ULTRA that had little or nothing to do with methods of interrogation.</p>
<p>The Colby revelations were part of a sweeping investigation of the CIA in January 1975 by the “Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States,” chaired by Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller. The subsequent June 1975 Report to the President said: “The drug program was part of a much larger CIA program to study possible means for controlling human behaviour. Other studies explored the effects of radiation, electric-shock, psychology, psychiatry, sociology and harassment substances.”</p>
<p>Even though the program got off to a rocky start with the Olson affair, it recovered quickly and became an umbrella project with 149 sub-projects. The overall guiding principal was succinctly stated in an internal CIA memo dated January 1952: “Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature such as self-preservation?”<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>The drug program came under the aegis of the Chemical Division of the Technical Services Staff headed up by Sidney Gottlieb from 1951 to 1956. Gottlieb was a highly intelligent eccentric who drank goat’s milk, enjoyed folk-dancing, and raised Christmas trees on his farm outside Washington.</p>
<p>The Agency funded <a title="Are Psychedelic Drugs the Next Frontier in Wellness Research?" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2012/09/26/can-lsd-help-cure-depression/">LSD research programs</a> at major medical centres and universities including Boston Psychopathic, Mt. Sinai Hospital at Columbia University, University of Illinois Medical School, University of Oklahoma and others. The funding was carried out secretly through the Josiah Macy Foundation, and the Geschickter Fund for Medical Research in Washington, D.C. The CIA claimed the secrecy was necessary to keep it from the Russians, but we have already seen that it was part of much larger project to <a title="The Illuminati: Renegades of the Mystery Schools" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/06/17/the-illuminati-renegades-of-the-mystery-schools/">learn how to control human behaviour</a> in general, so this is not credible.</p>
<p>Gottlieb told Dr. Harold Abramson at Mt. Sinai (who just happened to be the psychiatrist that Olson was supposed to see!) that he wanted “operationally pertinent materials [about]: a. Disturbance of Memory; b. Discrediting by Aberrant Behaviour; c. Alteration of Sex Patterns; d. Eliciting of Information; e. Suggestibility; f. Creation of Dependence.” That sounds like pretty deep stuff for the spy game. They were really afraid of public reaction and congressional condemnation, especially since the CIA charter did not allow domestic operations, and certainly prohibited experimentation on US citizens.</p>
<p>The callousness of the research is best exemplified by the CIA-funded work of Dr. Harris Isbell, the Director of the Addiction Research Center in Lexington, Kentucky. The drug addict hospital inmates, who were mostly black, were encouraged to volunteer for LSD research in return for hard drugs of their choice or time off their sentences. In most cases, they were given pure morphine or heroin. At one point Isbell kept seven men on LSD for 77 straight days. Many others were on it for up to 42 days.</p>
<p>Concerning extended LSD usage, John Marks in his landmark book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393307948/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0393307948&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank"><em>The Search for the Manchurian Candidate: The CIA and Mind Control</em></a> says about writer Hunter S. Thompson (recently deceased) that he “frightened his readers with accounts of drug (LSD) binges lasting a few days, during which Thompson felt his brain boiling away in the sun, his nerves wrapping around enormous barbed wire forts, and his remaining faculties reduced to their reptilian antecedents.” The recent movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ISJQ1W/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B006ISJQ1W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank"><em>The Rum Diary</em></a>,<em> </em>starring Johnny Depp, based on the autobiographical book by Hunter S. Thompson, presents an imaginative re-enactment of his LSD adventures.</p>
<h3>The CIA Turns On the Counter-Culture</h3>
<p>Not satisfied with university research, Gottlieb recruited New York narcotics agent George White to distribute LSD surreptitiously to the “borderline underworld.” Operating through safe houses in Greenwich Village, Haight-Ashbury and Marin County, White gave doses to prostitutes, pimps, drug addicts and other “marginal people” and then observed the results and reported to Gottlieb.</p>
<p>John Marks says they were people “who would be powerless to seek any sort of revenge if they ever found out what the CIA had done to them. In addition to their being unlikely whistle-blowers, such people lived in a world where an unwitting dose of some drug… was an occupational hazard anyway.”</p>
<p>Eventually, White started using it randomly all over New York and San Francisco. Regarding the results, Marks says, “The MKULTRA scientists reaped little but disaster, mischief, and disappointment from their efforts to use LSD as a miracle weapon against the minds of their opponents.” Yet, they continued this program for 10 years until 1963.</p>
<p>Ironically, since the CIA had pretty much cornered the market on LSD internationally, buying up all the product of Sandoz and Eli Lilly, the spread of the drug to the counter-culture was through the Agency.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=Timothy%20Leary&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">Timothy Leary</a>, Ken Kesey, Allen Ginsburg and Tom Wolfe were first “turned on” thanks to the CIA, and that’s how the “flower children” became psychedelic.</p>
<p>But, the LSD experiments may have been more successful than Marks realised. They were carefully noting the precise effects on brain chemistry, and in the six areas that Gottlieb was concerned with: memory disturbance, aberrant behaviour, altered sexual patterns, eliciting information, suggestibility and creation of dependence. This became evident when they started using LSD as an adjunct in hypnotic and electronic experiments.</p>
<h3>Re-Patterning the Brain</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most notorious and nefarious MK-ULTRA sub-project was carried out at the Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal, Canada under the directorship of Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron, an American from Albany, New York. Cameron had trained at the Royal Mental Hospital in Glasgow, Scotland, under eugenicist Sir David Henderson, and founded the Canadian branch of the World Federation for Mental Health. At various times, he was elected president of the Canadian, American, and World psychiatric associations. In other words, Cameron was no renegade but had the full faith and endorsement of the world psychiatric establishment.</p>
<p>The CIA wanted Cameron to “depattern” the contents of the brain to make it receptive to new patterning. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=David%20Remnick&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">David Remnick</a> in a <em>Washington Post </em>article on 28 July 1985 said:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The…. heart of the laboratory was the Grid Room…. The subject was strapped into a chair involuntarily, by force, his head bristling with electrodes and transducers. Any resistance was met with a paralysing dose of curare. The subject’s brainwaves were beamed to a nearby reception room crammed with voice analysers, a wire recorder and radio receivers cobbled together… The systematic annihilation or ‘depatterning’ of a subject’s mind and memory was accomplished with overdoses of LSD, barbiturate sleep for 65 days at a stretch and ECT shocks at 75 times the recommended dosage. Psychic driving, the repetition of a recorded message for 16 hours a day, programmed the empty mind. Fragile patients referred to Allan Memorial for help were thus turned into carbuncular jellyfish.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0930852923/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0930852923&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">Anton Chaitkin</a> in his essay, ‘British Psychiatry: From Eugenics to Assassination’, says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Patients lost all or part of their memories, and some lost the ability to control their bodily functions and to speak. At least one patient was reduced almost to a vegetable; then Cameron had the cognitive centres of her brain surgically cut apart, while keeping her alive. Some subjects were deposited permanently in institutions for the hopelessly insane.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The CIA funded these horrors through a front called “The Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology.” Other supporters of the Allan Institute were the Rockefeller Foundation, the Geschickter Foundation, and the Canadian government.</p>
<p>About Cameron’s work, Wikipedia says: “Naomi Klein states, in her book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312427999/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0312427999&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">The Shock Doctrine</a>,</em> that Cameron’s research and his contribution to the MKUltra project was actually not about mind control and brainwashing, but ‘to design a scientifically based system for extracting information from “resistant sources.” In other words, torture’. And citing a book from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=Alfred%20W.%20McCoy&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">Alfred W. McCoy</a> it further says that ‘Stripped of its bizarre excesses, Cameron’s experiments, building upon Donald O. Hebb’s earlier breakthrough, laid the scientific foundation for the CIA’s two-stage psychological torture method’.” This method was codified in the infamous “KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation Manual” published by the CIA in July 1963, and in the <em>Human Resources Exploitation Training Manual – 1983 </em>that was used in CIA training courses in Latin American countries up until 1987. These manuals describe methods of psychological torture, far more potent than physical torture, to elicit information from “resistant sources.”</p>
<h3>An Orwellian Nightmare</h3>
<p>As one would expect, the technologies now available to the mind-controllers have zoomed off the chart to the point where George Orwell’s <a title="Is Privacy History? Top 5 Ways You Are Being Digitally Monitored and Catalogued Daily" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2012/12/11/is-privacy-history-top-5-ways-you-are-being-digitally-monitored-and-catalogued-daily/">world of omni-surveillance</a> now seems almost quaint. Of course, it is true that 1984 was 28 years ago. But even as far back as 1970, US congressman James Scheur was able to say:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“As a result of spinoffs from medical, military aerospace and industrial research, we are now in the process of developing devices and products capable of controlling violent mobs without injury. We can tranquillise, impede, immobilise, harass, shock, upset, stupefy, nauseate, chill, temporarily blind, deafen or just plain scare the wits out of anyone the police have a proper need to control and restrain.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>A brief survey of some of the scariest products known to be in the arsenal of the secretive alphabet agencies arrayed against John Q. Public are such devices as the Neurophone, patented by Dr. Patrick Flanagan in 1968. It converts sound to electrical impulses which can be delivered from satellites. When aimed at individuals, the impulses travel directly to the brain where the sounds are re-assembled and appear to be voices inside the head, which can be perceived as coming from God, or telepathic aliens, or whatever. Or the sounds can come out of a turned-off TV or radio. Through software, the device can mimic anyone’s voice and translate into any language.</p>
<p>It is believed that the CIA, DIA, NSA et al use the Neurophone to deliver threats and propaganda to selected targets, or just to torment someone they don’t like. One can imagine the possibilities. Could this explain some of the killings by “psychopaths” who say they were instructed by God, such as Mark David Chapman, David Berkowitz, or Sirhan Sirhan? If they had been previously evaluated through sophisticated personality assessments and groomed by LSD or hypnosis, such voices could easily tip the balance and convince them to kill.</p>
<p>We’ve all heard about the “Thought Police” and laughed because it seemed so implausible. Well, the joke is on us. <a title="Airport Scanners in 2014 – Fear and the End of Privacy" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/02/14/airport-scanners-in-2014-fear-and-the-end-of-privacy/">Brain scanning technology</a> is now well-advanced. In 1974, Lawrence Pinneo, a neurophysiologist and electronic engineer with the Stanford Research Institute succeeded in correlating brain wave patterns from EEGs with specific words. In 1994, the brain wave patterns of 40 subjects were officially correlated with both spoken words and silent thought at the University of Missouri. It is believed that US intelligence agencies now have a brain wave vocabulary of over 60,000 words in most common languages.</p>
<p>Brain waves constitute a magnetic field around the head (the aura), each person having a unique, identifiable electromagnetic signature which becomes visible through Kirlian photography, and these fields can be monitored by satellites. The translated results are then fed back to ground-side super computers at speeds of up to 20 gigabytes/second. Neurophone messages can then be beamed to selected individuals based on their thoughts. It is believed that about one million people around the globe are now monitored on a regular basis. As these numbers increase, as they certainly will, to include most educated and important people in the world, the <a title="Former Presidents Warn About the “Invisible Government” Running the United States" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/09/13/former-presidents-warn-about-the-invisible-government-running-united-states/">New World Order</a> will definitely have arrived.</p>
<p>As Australian writer Paul Baird has observed, “no-one will ever be able to even think about expressing an opinion contrary to those forced on us by the New World Order. There will literally be no intellectual property that cannot be stolen, no writing that cannot be censored, no thought that cannot be suppressed (by the most oppressive/invasive means).” Baird also claims that ex-military/intelligence whistle-blowers have reported that experiments in controlling voters with these techniques have been tried in several foreign countries. So much for democracy.</p>
<p>Other technologies, such as microwave bombardment to confuse and disorient field personnel, microchip implantation, silently delivered acoustical subliminal messages, widespread population control through psychiatric drugs, and extreme close-up satellite-based viewing able to read documents indoors, are all well-developed and in use by military and intelligence agencies. This doesn’t even address the monitoring of overt spoken and written material. Under Project ECHELON, the NSA monitors every call, fax, e-mail and computer data message in and out of the US, Canada and several other countries. Their computers then search for key words and phrases. Anything or anyone of interest draws the attention of agency operatives, who can then commence surveillance operations by the NSA or other intelligence agencies.</p>
<h3>Novel Capabilities</h3>
<p>We conclude with a chilling vision of the future from the US Air Force Scientific Advisory Board. It is from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARTBL4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B003ARTBL4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank"><em>New World Vistas of Air and Space Power for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Prior to the mid-21st century, there will be a virtual explosion of knowledge in the field of neuroscience. We will have achieved a clear understanding of how the human brain works, how it really controls the various functions of the body, and how it can be manipulated (both positively and negatively). One can envision the development of electromagnetic energy sources, the output of which can be pulsed, shaped, and focused, that can couple with the human body in a fashion that will allow one to prevent voluntary muscular movements, control emotions (and thus actions), produce sleep, transmit suggestions, interfere with both short-term and long-term memory, produce an experience set, and delete an experience set. This will open the door for the development of some novel capabilities that can be used in armed conflict, in terrorist/hostage situations, and in training…”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And based on the past clandestine abuses of MK-ULTRA reviewed above, one can predict with relative certainty that these capabilities will be used on civilians, with or without their knowledge or acquiescence, in the service of the New World Order.</p>

</div>
<p>The blame game repeats with disturbing regularity. Media scoundrels bear full responsibility. They lie for power. They do it repeatedly. They do it disgracefully. They ignore hard facts.</p>
<p>Throughout months of conflict, Assad&#8217;s been wrongfully blamed for insurgent massacres, atrocities, chemical weapons use and other high crimes.</p>
<p>Throughout months of conflict, no evidence whatever links Syrian forces to chemical weapons use. They had nothing to do with attacking Ghouta. Not according Washington, Britain, France and Israel.</p>
<p>Media scoundrels regurgitate their lies. It doesn&#8217;t surprise. They&#8217;re waging war on Syria. They support Obama&#8217;s imperial aggression. They endorse his regime change plans. They back military force to do so.</p>
<p>On September 16, The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/17/world/europe/syria-united-nations.html?_r=0" target="_blank">New York Times</a> headlined &#8220;Forensic Details in UN Report Point to Assad&#8217;s Use of Gas,&#8221; saying:</p>
<p>UN inspectors didn&#8217;t assign blame. &#8220;(D)etails (they) documented included the large size and particular shape of the munitions and the precise direction from which two of them had been fired.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Taken together, that information appeared to undercut arguments by President Bashar al-Assad of Syria that rebel forces, who are not known to possess such weapons or the training or ability to use them, had been responsible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moreover, those weapons are fired by large, conspicuous launchers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For rebels to have carried out the attack, they would have had to organize an operation with weapons they are not known to have and of considerable scale, sophistication and secrecy &#8211; moving the launchers undetected into position in areas under strong government influence or control, keeping them in place unmolested for a sustained attack that would have generated extensive light and noise, and then successfully withdrawing them &#8211; all without being detected in any way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fact check</p>
<p>Throughout months of conflict, Washington, key NATO allies, Israel, and rogue Arab League partners armed, funded and trained insurgents.</p>
<p>They recruited cold-blooded killers. They include Al Qaeda, Al Nusra, and other extremist elements. Heavy weapons are supplied. So are toxic chemicals.</p>
<p>Pentagon contractors trained them in their handling and use. CIA and US special forces are involved.</p>
<p>Rockets with sarin came from insurgent held territory. Pro-Assad civilians were attacked. Don&#8217;t expect Times editors, commentators or other contributors to explain.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/kerry-un-will-enforce-deal-to-rid-syria-of-chemical-weapons/2013/09/16/0f1d9bf6-1eb6-11e3-94a2-6c66b668ea55_story.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> headlined &#8220;In Syria, UN inspectors find &#8216;clear and convincing&#8217; evidence of chemical attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius was quoted saying:</p>
<p>The UN report &#8220;confirms the position of those of us who have said the regime is guilty.&#8221; Senator John McCain (R. AZ) was cited urging war.</p>
<p>The Washington Post owned<a href="http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/09/16/us_and_russia_spar_over_un_report_despite_evidence_pointing_to_syrian_regime" target="_blank"> Foreign Policy (FP) magazine</a> headlined &#8220;Russia and the West Spar Over UN Report, Despite Evidence Pointing to Syrian Regime,&#8221; saying:</p>
<p>The UN report doesn&#8217;t &#8220;directly blame either the Syrian government or the Syrian opposition, but the scrupulous level of detail in the report provides new evidence pointing to a military-orchestrated assault rather than a rebel-executed chemical weapons attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chemical weapons expert Ralf Trapp was quoted. He ignored clear facts explaining opposite of what he said. Doing so discredits his so-called expertise.</p>
<p>He said evidence &#8220;is consistent with an alleged use by Syrian government troops.&#8221;</p>
<p>It &#8220;points to a weapon that came from a military program, used by units that understand and have training in chemical warfare operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chris Harmer is an Institute for the Study of War senior naval analyst. Jeff White is a pro-Israeli Washington Institute for Near East Policy defense fellow.</p>
<p>Both agree with Trapp. According to Harmer:</p>
<p>&#8220;The rebels in Syria can get off a few mortar rounds here and there. On a good day they might even fire off a salvo of recoilless rifles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they don&#8217;t have the ability to deploy mass indirect fires with rockets, which is how this sarin gas attack occurred in Damascus. The regime does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose the apologists for the regime will say they could have been fired from anywhere along those trajectories, but this certainly supports the US intell conclusion that the rockets came from regime territory.&#8221;</p>
<p>False! Previous articles explained. So does information above. Insurgents have opportunity, motive, heavy weapons, chemical agents, and training on how to use them.</p>
<p>FP lied for power. So did sources it cited. Anti-imperial ones were excluded. Truth is suppressed. It&#8217;s consistently turned on it head.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal went on the warpath. It did so in several reports. It <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323981304579078661513059576.html" target="_blank">headlined</a> &#8220;Report on Gas Attack Emboldens US.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;White House Says UN Account Confirms Damascus&#8217; Responsibility, Rallies Support for Punitive Steps.&#8221; It claims &#8220;powerful evidence&#8221; indicts Assad. It suggests Iranian involvement.</p>
<p>According to the Journal, the Ghouta attack &#8220;relied on rockets that, based on the UN descriptions, were of an Iranian design, though they may have been manufactured in Syria, the experts said.</p>
<p>Iran is Washington&#8217;s prime target. It&#8217;s Israel&#8217;s. Syria is prelude to targeting the Islamic Republic. The road to Tehran runs through Damascus.</p>
<p>The Journal quoted Washington&#8217;s UN envoy Samantha Power wrongfully claiming &#8220;technical details make clear that only the regime could have carried out this large-scale chemical weapons attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lied saying so. It&#8217;s the oil, gas and regional dominance, stupid!</p>
<p>The Journal quoted French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius saying &#8220;All of the (anti-Assad) options remain on the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>Britain&#8217;s UN envoy Mark Lyall Grant said evidence leaves &#8220;no doubt that it was the regime that used chemical weapons.</p>
<p>A previous day <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323846504579075850763373532.html" target="_blank">Journal editorial</a> headlined &#8220;Into the Syrian Bazaar,&#8221; saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if Assad gives up his chemical weapons, he escapes unpunished for using them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, John Kerry lied calling him &#8220;a thug and murderer.&#8221; America is the world champion thuggish mass murderer and much more. Kerry&#8217;s complicit in high crimes.</p>
<p>Obama lied saying his &#8220;goal is to make sure what happened (in Ghouta) does not happen again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bears full responsibility for what happened. Syria is his war. Cutthroat killers are his shock troops. They&#8217;re supplied toxic chemicals. They&#8217;re trained how to use them.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t expect Journal editors to explain. A separate Senator John Barrasso (R. WY) op-ed <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323846504579071032837026884.html" target="_blank">headlined</a>&#8220;Why the Russians Can&#8217;t Be Trusted in Syria.&#8221;</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t surprise. He&#8217;s one of many extremist Capitol Hill right wing neocons. He&#8217;s unfit to serve. Journal editors featured his commentary.</p>
<p>He said when Obama &#8220;reset&#8221; relations with Russia in 2009, &#8220;Americans never expected that it would include making Vladimir Putin the de facto US ambassador to Syria in 2013.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Kerry/Lavrov deal is the &#8220;most recent evidence,&#8221; he said. It&#8217;s &#8220;a Russian delaying tactic on behalf of its Syrian ally &#8211; a tactic we&#8217;ve seen before.&#8221;</p>
<p>He claims Moscow is &#8220;supplying Assad with advanced cruise missiles.&#8221; He implied offensive ones. He better check his facts. Russia contacted to supply Syria with sophisticated S-300 and other air defense launch systems.</p>
<p>Barrasso claims &#8220;Moscow&#8217;s military support of the Assad regime is one of the main reasons that more than 100,000 Syrians have been killed in the current conflict.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;(T)he Russians have vetoed every (Security Council) attempt to end civil war.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moscow and China forthrightly blocked Washington&#8217;s planned aggression. They did so with three Security Council vetoes.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing civil about Syria&#8217;s conflict. US-enlisted death squads wage it. They&#8217;re imported from dozens of countries. Barrasso didn&#8217;t explain.</p>
<p>His anti-Russian diatribe included a laundry list of lies. &#8220;For more than four years, the Obama administration has capitulated to Mr. Putin&#8217;s demands and accepted his rebukes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dmitry Medvedev was president throughout most of the period. His policies were very conciliatory. He got nothing back in return.</p>
<p>In March 2012, Putin was reelected president. He won overwhelmingly. On May 7, he assumed office. Perhaps Barrasso didn&#8217;t notice. His Senate record reflects incompetence. He prioritizes war and more of it.</p>
<p>Moscow isn&#8217;t complying with its own commitment to eliminate its chemical weapons, he said. No corroborating evidence was cited.</p>
<p>Plenty suggests Washington violates Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) provisions repeatedly. It uses chemical, biological and radiological weapons in all its wars. It does so lawlessly.</p>
<p>Barrasso didn&#8217;t explain. Instead he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on the experience of the past four years, the Russians, like the Iranians, are well aware that pretending to go along can buy time until the Obama administration becomes distracted with another issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The US should be prepared for the diplomatic effort on Syria to fall flat and have more effective alternatives ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The president needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with a coherent, realistic Syria policy &#8211; one that does not rely on Russia&#8217;s cooperation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barrasso has lawless aggression in mind. Neocon extremists think that way. They support permanent wars.</p>
<p>They endorse waging them against humanity. It bears repeating. They risk launching WW III.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/911-Mossad-Jews-Israel-Zionism3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/911-Mossad-Jews-Israel-Zionism3.jpg" align="left" /></a>Washington has been at war for 12 years. According to experts such as Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes, these wars have cost Americans approximately $6 trillion, enough to keep Social Security and Medicare sound for years. All there is to show for 12 years of war is fat bank balances for the armament industries and a list of destroyed countries with millions of dead and dislocated people who never lifted a hand against the United States.</p>
<p>The cost paid by American troops and taxpayers is extreme. Secretary of Veteran Affairs Erik Shinseki reported in November 2009 that “more veterans have committed suicide since 2001 than we have lost on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan.” Many thousands of our troops have suffered amputations and traumatic brain injuries. At the Marine Corps War College Jim Lacey calculated that the annual cost of the Afghan war was $1.5 billion for each al-Qaeda member in Afghanistan. Many US and coalition troops paid with their lives for every one al-Qaeda member killed. On no basis has the war ever made sense.</p>
<p>Washington’s wars have destroyed the favorable image of the United States created over the decades of the cold war. No longer the hope of mankind, the US today is viewed as a threat whose government cannot be trusted.</p>
<p>The wars that have left America’s reputation in tatters are the consequence of 9/11. The neoconservatives who advocate America’s hegemony over the world called for “a new Pearl Harbor” that would allow them to launch wars of conquest. Their plan for conquering the Middle East as their starting point was set out in the neoconservative “Project for the New American Century.” It was stated clearly by Commentary editor Norman Podhoretz and also by many neoconservatives.</p>
<p>The neocon argument boils down to a claim that history has chosen “democratic capitalism” and not Karl Marx as the future. To comply with history’s choice, the US must beef up its military and impose the American Way on the entire world.</p>
<p>In other words, as Claes Ryn wrote, the American neoconservatives are the “new Jacobins,” a reference to the French Revolution of 1789 that intended to overthrow aristocratic Europe and replace it with “Liberty, equality, fraternity,” but instead gave Europe a quarter century of war, death, and destruction.</p>
<p>Ideologies are dangerous, because they are immune to facts. Now that the United States is no longer governed by the US Constitution, but by a crazed ideology that has given rise to a domestic police state more complete than that of Communist East Germany and to a warfare state that attacks sovereign countries based on nothing but manufactured lies, we are left with the irony that Russia and China are viewed as constraints on Washington’s ability to inflict evil, death, and destruction on the world.</p>
<p>The two pariah states of the 20th century have become the hope of mankind in the 21st century!</p>
<p>As Oliver Stone and Peter Kuznick prove in their book, The Untold History of the United States, the American government has never deserved its white hat reputation. Washington has been very successful in dressing up its crimes in moralistic language and hiding them in secrecy. It is only decades after events that the truth comes out.</p>
<p>For example, on August 19, 1953, the democratically elected government of Iran was overthrown by a coup instigated by the US government. Sixty years after the event declassified CIA documents detail how the secret CIA operation overthrew a democratic government and imposed Washington’s puppet on the people of Iran.</p>
<p>The declassified documents could not have spelled it out any clearer: “The military coup that overthrew Mossadeq and his National Front cabinet was carried out under CIA direction as an act of U.S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government.”<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/19/politics/cia-iran-1953-coup" target="_blank">http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/19/politics/cia-iran-1953-coup </a></p>
<p>In the 21st century Washington is attempting to repeat its 1953 feat of overthrowing the Iranian government, this time using the faux “green revolution” financed by Washington.<br />
When that fails, Washington will rely on military action.</p>
<p>If 60 years is the time that must pass before Washington’s crimes can be acknowledged, the US government will admit the truth about September 11, 2001 on September 11, 2061. In 2013, on this 12th anniversary of 9/11, we only have 48 years to go before Washington admits the truth. Alas, the members of the 9/11 truth movement will not still be alive to receive their vindication.</p>
<p>But just as it has been known for decades that Washington overthrew Mossadeq,<br />
we already know that the official story of 9/11 is hogwash.</p>
<p>No evidence exists that supports the government’s 9/11 story. The 9/11 Commission was a political gathering run by a neoconservative White House operative. The Commission members sat and listened to the government’s story and wrote it down. No investigation of any kind was made. One member of the Commission resigned, saying that the fix was in. After the report was published, both co-chairmen of the Commission and the legal counsel wrote books disassociating themselves from the report. The 9/11 Commission was “set up to fail,” they wrote.</p>
<p>NIST’s account of the structural failure of the twin towers is a computer simulation based on assumptions chosen to produce the result. NIST refuses to release its make-believe explanation for expert scrutiny. The reason is obvious. NIST’s explanation of the structural failure of the towers cannot survive scrutiny.</p>
<p>There are many 9/11 Truth organizations whose members are high-rise architects,<br />
structural engineers, physicists, chemists and nano-chemists, military and civilian airline pilots, firemen and first responders, former prominent government officials, and 9/11 families. The evidence they have amassed overwhelms the feeble official account.</p>
<p>It has been proven conclusively that World Trade Center Building 7 fell at free fall which can only be achieved by controlled demolition that removes all resistance below to debris falling from above so that no time is lost in overcoming resistance from intact structures. NIST has acknowledged this fact, but has not changed its story.</p>
<p>In other words, still in America today official denial takes precedence over science and<br />
known undisputed facts.</p>
<p>On this 12th anniversary of a false flag event, it is unnecessary for me to report the voluminous evidence that conclusively proves that the official story is a lie. You can read it for yourself. It is available online. You can read what the architects and engineers have to say. You can read the scientists’ reports. You can hear from the first responders who were in the WTC towers. You can read the pilots who say that the maneuvers associated with the airliner that allegedly hit the Pentagon are beyond their skills and most certainly were not performed by inexperienced pilots.</p>
<p>You can read David Griffin’s many books. You can watch the film produced by Richard Gage and Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 truth. You can read the 9/11 Toronto Report, International Hearings on 9/11. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/9-11-Toronto-Report/dp/1478369205/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376960447&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Toronto+Report" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/9-11-Toronto-Report/dp/1478369205/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376960447&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Toronto+Report </a>You can read this book: <a href="http://www.international.to/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9319:hijacking-americas-mind-on-911-counterfeiting-evidence&amp;catid=66:oped&amp;Itemid=151" target="_blank">http://www.international.to/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9319:hijacking-americas-mind-on-911-counterfeiting-evidence&amp;catid=66:oped&amp;Itemid=151</a></p>
<p>Actually, you do not need any of the expert evidence to know that the US government’s story is false. As I have previously pointed out, had a few young Saudi Arabians, the alleged 9/11 hijackers, been capable of outwitting, without support from any government and intelligence service, not only the CIA and FBI, but all sixteen US intelligence services, the intelligence services of Washington’s NATO allies and Israel’s Mossad, the National Security Council, NORAD, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Traffic Control, and defeat Airport Security four times in one hour on the same morning, the White House, Congress, and the media would have been demanding an investigation of how the National Security State could so totally fail.</p>
<p>Instead, the President of the United States and every government office fiercely resisted any investigation. It was only after a year of demands and rising pressure from the 9/11 families that the 9/11 Commission was created to bury the issue.</p>
<p>No one in government was held accountable for the astonishing failure. The national security state was defeated by a few rag tag Muslims with box cutters and a sick old man dying from renal failure while holed up in a cave in Afghanistan, and no heads rolled.</p>
<p>The total absence from the government for demands for an investigation of an event that is the greatest embarrassment to a “superpower” in world history is a complete give-away that 9/11was a false flag event. The government did not want any investigation, because the government’s cover story cannot stand investigation.</p>
<p>The government could rely on the mega-media corporations in whose hands the corrupt Clinton regime concentrated the US media. By supporting rather than investigating the government’s cover story, the media left the majority of Americans, who are sensitive to peer pressure, without any support for their doubts. Effectively, the American Ministry of Propaganda validated the government’s false story.</p>
<p>Common everyday experiences of Americans refute the government’s story. Consider, for example, self-cleaning ovens. How many American homes have them? Thirty million? More? Do you have one?</p>
<p>Do you know what temperature self-cleaning ovens reach? The self-cleaning cycle runs for several hours at 900 degrees Fahrenheit or 482 degrees Celsius. Does your self-cleaning oven melt at 482 degrees Celsius. No, it doesn’t. Does the very thin, one-eighth inch steel soften and your oven collapse? No, it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Keep that in mind while you read this: According to tests performed by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), only 2% of the WTC steel tested by NIST reached temperatures as high as 250 degrees Celsius, about half the temperature reached by your self-cleaning oven. Do you believe that such low temperatures on such small areas of the WTC towers caused the massive, thick, steel columns in the towers to soften and permit the collapse of the buildings? If you do, please explain why your self-cleaning oven doesn’t weaken and collapse.</p>
<p>In Section E.5 of the Executive Summary in this NIST report<a href="http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=101019" target="_blank">http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=101019</a> it says: “A method was developed using microscopic observations of paint cracking to determine whether steel members had experienced temperatures in excess of 250 degrees C. More than 170 areas were examined . . . Only three locations had a positive result indicating that the steel and paint may have reached temperatures in excess of 250 degrees C.” Analysis of steel “microstructures show no evidence of exposure to temperatures above 600 degrees C for any significant time.”</p>
<p>In section 3.6 of the NIST report<a href="http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=860495" target="_blank"> http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=860495</a>NIST states: “NIST believes that this collection of steel from the WTC towers is adequate for purposes of the investigation.”</p>
<p>How did these truths get out? My explanation is that the NIST scientists, resentful of the threat to their jobs and future employment opportunities and chaffing under the order to produce a false report, revealed the coerced deception by including information that their political masters did not understand. By stating unequivocally the actual temperatures, NIST’s scientists put the lie to the coerced report.</p>
<p>The melting point of steel is around 1,500 degrees C. or 2,600 degrees F. Steel can lose strength at lower temperatures, but the NIST scientists reported that only a small part of the steel was even subjected to moderate temperatures less than those obtained by the self-cleaning oven in your home.</p>
<p>If you need to think about this a bit more, obtain a copy of The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhodes. Have a look at the streetcar in photo 108. The caption reads: “The Hiroshima fireball instantly raised surface temperatures within a mile of the hypocenter well above 1,000 degrees F.” Is the streetcar a melted lump of steel? No, it is structurally intact, although blackened with burnt paint.</p>
<p>Washington would have you believe that steel that survived intact the atomic bomb would melt from low temperature, short lived, isolated office fires. What do you think of a government that believes that you are that stupid?</p>
<p>Who would support a government that lies every time it opens its mouth?</p>
<p>The three WTC buildings that were destroyed were massive heat sinks. I doubt that<br />
the limited, short-lived, low temperature fires in the buildings even warmed the massive steel structures to the touch.</p>
<p>Moreover, not a single steel column melted or deformed from softening. The columns<br />
were severed at specific lengths by extremely high temperature charges placed on the columns.</p>
<p>On this 12th anniversary of 9/11, ask yourself if you really want to believe that temperatures half those reached by your self-cleaning oven caused three massive steel structures to crumble into dust.</p>
<p>Then ask yourself why your government thinks you are so totally stupid as to believe such a fairy tale as your government has told you about 9/11.</p>

			<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/boston-martial-law-dress-rehearsal1.jpg" width="276" height="178" />We have grown accustomed to the tyranny at the Federal level. The CIA is the most efficient organized criminal operation on the planet. The spy tactics of the NSA would make the East German Stasi green with envy. With the NSA watching our every move, nobody should feel safe for fear of being branded an enemy of the state. Even journalists are feeling the brunt of the new found bravado of the globalists. The systematic murders of journalists such as Andrew Breitbart and Michael Hastings for getting “too close” are stark reminders that our republic democracy is a facade and has degenerated into a wolf in sheep’s clothing.</p>
<p>Where the Federal government and the existence of their confederate secret societies such as the Council on Foreign Relation and the Trilateral Commission, were once denied, they are now fully admitted to and championed as the true rulers of this country.</p>
<h4>Trilaterals Over Washington</h4>
<div><img alt="Talking about the CFR used to bring on the tin foil hat comments. Now this criminal organization and its minions are fully exposed as evidenced by Hillary giving her Secretary of State Farewell Address to the organization on January 31, 2013." src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hillary-and-the-cfr.jpg" width="276" /><br />
<em>Talking about the CFR used to bring on the tin foil hat comments. Now this criminal organization and its minions are fully exposed as evidenced by Hillary giving her Secretary of State Farewell Address to the organization on January 31, 2013.</em></p>
</div>
<p>I remember back in 1979 when I was given the book <em>Trilaterals Over Washington</em> which was co-authored by Anthony Sutton and Patrick Wood, that I was horrified that such a small group of men could control such vast resources and do so much harm to humanity. My admitted surprise speaks to my level of ignorance at that time. I was a budding researcher at the time and I had a ravenous appetite to learn more about these Constitutional usurpers. What I discovered was that Sutton and Wood’s book was largely a standalone piece. Of course there was the classic <em>None Dare Call It a Conspiracy, </em>by Gary Allen, and there was that one article in 1977 in Atlantic Monthly which mentioned the Trilateral Commission, but debunked the conspiratorial angle.</p>
<p>The media was postured in such a way, in that day, that if anyone mentioned the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission, you were marginalized and ridiculed. Today, we are witnessing a complete reversal in government secrecy as it relates to their participation in global tyranny and the installation of a police state surveillance grid.The destruction of this country is totally being done in stealth, but things have changed.</p>
<h4>Why Are the Misdeeds of the CIA Out In the Open?</h4>
<p>Indeed, the veil of NWO secrecy has been stripped away. The CIA is admitting past transgressions from as far back as 60 year ago when modern <em>Iranian</em>history took a critical turn when the CIA backed <em>coup</em> overthrew the overthrew the country’s prime <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/08/18/cia_admits_it_was_behind_irans_coup">minister</a>, Mohammed Mossadegh. True to their mafia nature, the CIA never admits to anything. Does this mean that they are turning over a new leaf and are submitting to a new era of agency transparency and accountability? Not really, when the CIA admits to their complicit behavior of running drugs for guns in the Iran-Contra Affair and setting up the cocaine gangs and started the drug war in LA in the 1980′s to fund and facilitate Iran Contra, I might take their “open disclosure intentions” more seriously. And when the CIA admits its role in the murder of JFK, then I might begin to cut some slack to what has been the most virulent organized criminal organization in the world. And when CIA director Brennan, admits to having award winning journalist Michael Hastings murdered, then maybe I will take a serious look at considering that the CIA is entering into a new era of openness.</p>
<h4>Did Obama Actually Fulfill One of His Campaign Promises?</h4>
<p>Some would argue that there is a new era of transparency that is emanating from Washington D.C. and that Obama is finally making good on his campaign promise to oversee the most transparent organization in the history of the country? Not in a pig’s eye. We are not witnessing a new age of accountability, we are watching the unveiling of in-your-face tyranny.</p>
<h4>Fear and Intimidation Is the Objective</h4>
<div><img alt="Close your curtains, NSA Director, Keith Alexander, is watching and listening to you." src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/nsa-keith-alexander-2.jpg" width="265" height="190" /><br />
<em>Close your curtains, NSA Director, Keith Alexander, is watching and listening to you.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Didn’t you get the message that tyranny is out of the closet and is being placed firmly in the faces of the American public? The globalists are sending a clear message, “Fear Us!” Their intent is to frighten and intimidate the public into believe that resistance is futile.</p>
<p>Recently, the NSA <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-23790912">revealed</a> that they spied upon innocent Americans by intercepting an unspecified number of emails. Of course, the NSA said that this was an “accident.” The accident aspect of the story is not believable, however, the objective was achieved with the revelation: “Be afraid America, very afraid, we are watching everything you do.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Nowhere is the in-your-face-tyranny more prevalent than in the today’s law enforcement agencies as we have witnessed the militarization of the police which are now designed to harass and intimidate.</em></p></blockquote>
<h4>The Overt Militarization of the Police</h4>
<p>As we witness the unfolding of the extreme militarization of the police, the American public is increasingly being subjected to heinous, Gestapo and KGB types of crimes being committed against innocent American citizens.</p>
<p>Recently, in Phoenix, stunned neighbors watched as mentally disturbed Michael Ruiz, who was having a mental heath episode on the roof of his apartment building, was choked and tasered while one of the assailing cops chanted the familiar refrain: “Stop resisting! Stop resisting!” The assailing cops then shackled Ruiz’s hands and feet, and dragged him down the stairs without supporting his head. Ruiz’s unsupported head struck every one of the concrete stairs on the way down. By the time Ruiz reached the parking, he was murdered by the shock troops of the Phoenix Police Department. Ruiz was declared brain-dead at nearby St. Joseph’s hospital. The police attempted to cover up their thuggish behavior by confiscating all the cell phones and cameras that they could find. However, these criminal police did not get all of them.</p>

<p>Alejandro Gonzalez surrendered in San Jose on January 10, 2011. The 22-year-old was the suspect in a non-fatal shooting that had taken place on New Year’s Day at a local bar called the Mucky Duck.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>A multi-agency SWAT team invaded the home of 31-year-old <a href="http://www.montereyherald.com/localnews/ci_23897554/monterey-county-agrees-pay-2-6-million-flash?source=rss">Rogelio Serrato, Jr</a>. Serrato, who was known as Roger to friends and family, and was not a suspect in the shooting. He was thought to have been harboring Gonzalez, which he was not. The police swat team threw in a flash grenade to his home, thus setting the house on fire and Serrato subsequently was killed.</em></p></blockquote>
<div><img alt="Roger Serrato and son." src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Roger-and-Son-300x169.jpg" width="300" height="169" /><br />
<em>Roger Serrato and son.</em></p>
</div>
<p><a href="http://www.montereyherald.com/education/ci_23897554/monterey-county-agrees-pay-2-6-million-flash">Monterey County agreed to a $2.6 million settlement</a> with Serrato’s family, which was paid by the county’s insurance carrier and absolves the sheriff’s office of legal responsibility while praising the actions of the arresting officers.</p>
<p>Who will ever forget the aftermath of the Boston Marathon Bombing? The show of force following the event was unwarranted and unprecedented as the police were given a script to follow by the Federal government and local officers performed their martial law “Federalized” duties with notable distinction.</p>
<h4>Even My Efforts Have Drawn Scrutiny From Criminal Elements</h4>
<p>I have been investigating the presence of Russian troops in Alaska, Tennessee, Kentucky and California. My efforts have drawn scrutiny as the new level of intimidation is being visited upon me for my efforts.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Dave,</em></p>
<p><em>Last month I talked to you on the phone and we were disconnected twice. As I know you are aware it was the ears of those who watch that disconnected us. Most of my communications by any means is usually intercepted, delayed or is sent back to me and never makes it to the receiver. I bring this up to you as I was talking to someone who knows me. This person told me they received a text message that identified it as coming from me and received several of them. They then received a telephone call from my number and claimed to be me and of course this person knew this was not true as they know my voice. Why i bring this up is during the course of the conversation whoever was calling commented that they wanted to talk to them about “Dave Hodges”. The only way that my number and your name would come up was from when we talked. There is some extremely guarded stuff going on at mclb in yermo. Thought i would share this with you, eyes and ears.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This is clearly a thinly veiled warning designed to intimidate me. For the record, I am not suicidal and I do not drive at high rates of speeds.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The police are the country’s most dangerous street gang. One significant distinction between police and their private sector counterparts is that street gangs don’t expect to receive commendations when they kill innocent people. However, it is not tyranny without an endgame. The fear and intimidation being perpetrated by law enforcement is by design. Why do they want us to be so fearful? They want us to be fearful, very fearful. What do they want us to be afraid of? The answer to that question is contained in the part of part of this series.</p>

				<p>August 14, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=18510#respond" title="Comment on Hiroshima, Nagasaki And &#8216;Bomb Iran&#8217;"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="18510 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=18510">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/iran-atomic-bomb3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/iran-atomic-bomb2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Last week marked the 68th anniversary of the WWII destruction of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima (Aug. 6) and Nagasaki (Aug. 9) — the first and only deployment of nuclear weapons in human history. Within moments of the nuclear explosions that destroyed these cities, at least  200,000 people lost their lives. Tens of thousands subsequently died from radiation poisoning within the next two weeks. The effects linger to this day.</p>
<p align="left">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has implied that this would the be fate of Israel if Iran was allowed to obtain nuclear weapon-making capabilities, including the ability to enrich high-grade uranium. To prevent this from happening, the economy of Iran must be crippled by <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/115678817/IranReport2-120312-2#fullscreen">sanctions</a> and the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/115678817/IranReport2-120312-2#fullscreen">fourth largest oil reserves</a> in the world must be barred from global markets, as the oil fields in which they are situated deteriorate. Israel — the only state in the region that actually possesses nuclear weapons and has <a href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/menwfz/">blocked</a> all efforts to create a <a href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/menwfz/docs/index.html">Middle East Nuclear Weapon Free Zone</a> – should thus be armed with cutting-edge American weaponry. Finally, the US must not only stand behind its sole reliable Middle East ally, which could strike Iran at will, it should ideally also lead — not merely condone — a military assault against Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>
<p align="left">Netanyahu invariably <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/1.529560">frames</a> the threat posed by Iranian nuclear capability (a term that blurs distinctions between civilian and potential military applications of nuclear technology) as “Auschwitz” rather than “Hiroshima and Nagasaki”, even though the latter might be a more apt analogy. The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/06/netanyahu-iran-nuclear-weapons-israel">potential</a> for another Auschwitz is predicated on the image of an Israel that is unable — or unwilling to — defend itself, resulting in six million Jews going “like sheep to the slaughter.” But if Israel and/or the US were to attack Iran instead of the other way around, “Hiroshima and Nagasaki” would be the analogy to apply to Iran.</p>
<p align="left">A country dropping bombs on any country that has not attacked first is an act of war, as the US was quick to point out when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor — and this includes so-called “surgical strikes”. In a <a href="http://www.levin.senate.gov/download/?id=f3dce1d1-a4ba-4ad1-a8d2-c47d943b1db6.">July 19 letter</a> about US options in Syria, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reminded the Senate Armed Services Committee that “…the decision to use force is not one that any of us takes lightly. It is no less than an act of war” [emphasis added].</p>
<p align="left">If the use of atomic weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during wartime remains morally and militarily questionable, one might think that there would be even less justification for a military strike on Iran, with whom neither Israel nor the US is at war. Of course, there are those who <a href="http://www.grassrootspeace.org/scott_ritter_23june05.html">disagree</a>: the US is engaged in a war on terror, Iran has been designated by the US as the chief state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and so on. Therefore, the US  is, or should be, at war with Iran.</p>
<p align="left">“All options are on the table” is the operative mantra with regard to the US halting Iran’s acquisition of a nuclear weapon. But if bombs start dropping on Iran, what kind will they be? In fact, the 30,000 lb. Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/10035349/Pentagon-redesigns-its-bunker-buster-Massive-Ordnance-Penetrator-to-combat-Iran.html">could be employed</a> against Iranian nuclear facilities are nuclear weapons, since they derive their capability of penetrating 200 feet of concrete in the earth from <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2013/0809/Nagasaki-bombing-Remembering-and-starting-to-forget-its-legacy">depleted uranium</a>. Furthermore, some Israelis have darkly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/opinion/18morris.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;gwh=18B760CBD255C6DD4D3700C835A19F84" target="_blank">hinted</a> that, were Israel to confront Iran alone, it would be more likely to reach into its unacknowledged nuclear armoury if that meant the difference between victory and defeat.</p>
<p align="left">Given all this, comparing the <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/05/nuclear-strike-tehran-israel">damage that would be done </a>by bombing Iran with the destruction of  Hiroshima and Nagasaki is not farfetched. It also reveals some troubling parallels. In the years prior to the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in response to what the US regarded as Japanese expansionism, <a href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/PUB905.pdf">imposed economic sanctions</a> on Japan in 1937. Just before the US entered the war, an embargo was placed on US exports of oil to Japan, upon which Japan was utterly dependent.</p>
<p align="left">In 1945, it was already clear that Japan was <a href="http://www.asian-studies.org/EAA/DowerInterview.pdf">preparing to surrender</a> and that the outstanding issue at hand was the status of its emperor. There was neither a military nor political need to use atomic weapons to bring an end to the war. <a href="http://csis.org/blog/understanding-decision-drop-bomb-hiroshima-and-nagasaki">Numerous justifications</a> for dropping atomic bombs on Japan were invoked, but nearly all of them were <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2013/0809/Nagasaki-bombing-Remembering-and-starting-to-forget-its-legacy">challenged or discredited</a> within a few years after the war ended. Three are particularly noteworthy today, as we continue to face the prospect of war with Iran.</p>
<p align="left">Saving lives: US Secretary of War Henry Stimson <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2013/0809/Nagasaki-bombing-Remembering-and-starting-to-forget-its-legacy">justified</a> the decision to use atomic weapons as “the least abhorrent choice” since it would not only would save the lives of up to a million American soldiers who might perish in a ground assault on Japan, it would also spare the lives of hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians who were being killed in fire bombings. President Harry Truman also claimed that “thousands of lives would be saved” and “a quarter of a million of the flower of our young manhood was worth a couple of Japanese cities.” But as Andrew Dilks <a href="https://disinfo.com/2013/08/hiroshima-nagasaki-and-the-big-historical-lie/">points out</a>, “None of these statements were based on any evidence.”</p>
<p align="left">Speaking in Warsaw, Poland on June 12 — two days before the Iranian election that he declared would “change nothing” with regard to Iran’s alleged quest to develop nuclear weaponry — Netanyahu used the opening of an Auschwitz memorial to make his case. “This is a regime that is building nuclear weapons with the expressed purpose to annihilate Israel’s six million Jews,” <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22886415">he said</a>. “We will not allow this to happen. We will never allow another Holocaust.” About the <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/05/nuclear-strike-tehran-israel">Iranians who would perish</a> after an Israeli attack, Netanyahu said nothing.</p>
<p align="left">Justifying expenditures: The <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/05/17/the-price-of-the-manhattan-project/">total estimated cost</a> of the Manhattan Project, which developed the bombs dropped on Japan, was nearly $2 billion in 1945, the equivalent of slightly more than $30 billion today. Secretary of State James Byrnes pointed out to President Harry Truman, who was up for re-election in 1948, that he could expect to be berated by Republicans for spending such a large amount on weapons that were never used, <a href="http://www.asian-studies.org/EAA/DowerInterview.pdf">according to</a> MIT’s John Dower.</p>
<p align="left">A <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf">recent report</a> by the Congressional Research Service shows that Israel is the single largest recipient of US aid, receiving a cumulative $118 billion, most of it military aid. The Bush administration and the Israeli government had agreed to a 10-year, $30 billion military aid package in 2007, which assured Israel of funding through 2018. During his March 2013 visit to Israel, President Barack Obama, who had been criticized by the US pro-Israel lobby for being less concerned than previous American presidents about Israel’s well being and survival, pledged that the United States would continue to provide Israel with multi-year commitments of military aid subject to the approval of Congress. Not to be outdone, the otherwise tightfisted Congress not only approved the added assistance Obama had promised, it also increased it. An Iran that is not depicted as dangerous would jeopardize the generous military assistance Israel receives. What better way to demonstrate how badly needed those US taxpayer dollars are than to show them in action?</p>
<p align="left">Technological research and development: One of the most puzzling questions about the <a href="http://www.asian-studies.org/EAA/DowerInterview.pdf">decision</a> to use nuclear weaponry against Japan is why, three days after the utter devastation wreaked on Hiroshima, a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. It was unnecessary from a <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/08/05/the-decision-to-bomb-hiroshima/">militarily perspective</a>. Perhaps the answer exists in the fact that the Manhattan Project had produced different types of atomic bombs: the destructive power of the “Little Boy”, which fell on Hiroshima, came from uranium; the power of “Fat Man”, which exploded over Nagasaki, came from plutonium. What better way to “scientifically” compare their effectiveness at annihilation than by using both?</p>
<p align="left">The award winning Israeli documentary, The Lab, which opens in the US this month, <a href="http://972mag.com/economic-strength-is-more-than-a-rhetorical-pun-its-a-work-plan/76488/">reveals</a> that Israel has used Lebanon and Gaza as a testing ground for advances in weaponry. Jonathan Cook <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/israels-thriving-arms-trade-is-a-setback-to-peace-agreement">writes</a>, “Attacks such as Operation Cast Lead of winter 2008-09 or last year’s Operation Pillar of Defence, the film argues, serve as little more than laboratory-style experiments to evaluate and refine the effectiveness of new military approaches, both strategies and weaponry.” Israeli military leaders have strongly hinted that in conducting air strikes against Syria, the Israeli Air Force is rehearsing for an attack on Iran, including the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/05/israel-air-strike-syria-security">use of bunker-buster bombs.</a></p>
<p align="left">The Pentagon, which <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jun/7/new-us-bunker-bombs-take-out-replica-underground-n/">reportedly</a> has invested $500 million in developing and revamping  MOP “bunker busters”, recently spent millions building a replica of Iran’s Fordow nuclear research facility in order to demonstrate to the Israelis that Iranian nuclear facilities can be destroyed when the time is right.</p>
<p align="left">Gen. Dempsey <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4416787,00.html">arrived</a> in Israel on Monday to meet with Israel’s Chief of Staff Benny Gantz and Israel’s political leaders. <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/08/07/3549018/florida-lawmakers-join-trip-to.html?story_link=email_msg">Members of Congress</a> from both political parties are also visiting — Democrats last week, Republicans this week — on an <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/peres-to-gop-reps-we-need-your-bipartisan-support/">AIPAC-sponsored</a>“fact-finding” mission. No doubt they will hear yet again from Israeli leaders that the world cannot allow another Auschwitz.</p>
<p align="left">The world cannot allow another Hiroshima and Nagasaki either.</p>
