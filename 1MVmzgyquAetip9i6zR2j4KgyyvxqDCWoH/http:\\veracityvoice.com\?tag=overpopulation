<p>In the last few months, 47,000 refugee children stormed America’s southern border.    They arrived from Central and South America.  The usual onslaught from Mexico’s overburdened population continued by the thousands.</p>
<p>In excess of 15 million undocumented Mexican border crossers now call America home.  They feed off America’s welfare systems from housing, food, educational and medical care.  They cost taxpayers in excess of $346 billion annually across 15 federal agencies.</p>
<p>Bush, Clinton, Bush II and Obama stopped enforcing our borders 30 years ago.  The word spread like a California wildfire.</p>
<p>Journalist Tom Ashbrook reported:  “The numbers of children surging over the southern US border now – unaccompanied, as young as six – is just staggering.  Forty thousand-plus.  Up 90 percent.  Still growing, flooding in.  Coming up from Central America, Mexico. Coming a thousand miles and more from Honduras.  Scared north by vicious gangs.   And now, piling up in US facilities not designed for an influx of kids.”</p>
<p>The third world uses America, Canada, Europe and Australia for a human “escape valve.”  Since the third world adds 80 million desperate children annually to already staggering populations in China, India, Bangladesh, Mexico, Indochina and most of Africa—Western countries face shocking migration numbers that will collapse civilizations.</p>
<p>Because of relentless, enormous and endless legal and illegal immigration, America faces an added 300,000,000 (million) more people within this century.</p>
<p>Ironically, Diane Sawyer, Brian Williams, Shepard Smith, Scott Pelley and Wolf Blitzer benignly report the invasion of our country—but they refuse to interview anyone who speaks about the end result of adding 300,000,000 people to America.</p>
<p>This is what it will look like:</p>
<p>“Immigration by the numbers—off the chart” by Roy Beck  <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.numbersusa.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNED3jeb_DBz-VHzIJCZ6AVxEEUXKg">www.NumbersUSA.org</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muw22wTePqQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muw22wTePqQ</a></p>
<p>If every American saw this video, they would scream at Congress and Obama to effectively close down mass migration into America.</p>
<p>Instead, powerful forces like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Speaker of the House John Boehner and corporations clamor for more immigration in the face of 48 million Americans subsisting on food stamps and tens of millions living off taxpayers with Section 8 housing.</p>
<p>“Late last week, the Obama administration asked Congress for $1.4 billion in extra funding to help house, feed and transport the tens of thousands of children being caught trying to cross the border illegally, and turned to the Defense Department to help temporarily house more than 1,000 of the children,” said Chris Sherman, DC journalist.</p>
<p>Every dollar paid out to care for endless legal and illegal immigration must be borrowed from foreign nations.  Our country stands a mind-numbing $18 trillion in debt.</p>
<p>As a country, as a civilization, as a people, we cannot continue on this path of accepting the world’s endless refugee line.  If we continue, we face ultimate collapse ourselves.  It’s that simple.</p>
<p>Our citizens chose 2.0 children per female since 1970, but the world eschewed birth control to continue adding 80 million annually, net gain.  Now, because of mass starvation of 10,000,000 (million children) annually, they cannot and we cannot solve the overload.</p>
<p>As a world traveler, I can tell you that the line never ends; it only grows exponentially.  Humanity faces hard choices in the 21<sup>st</sup> century that it continues to avoid, ignore and evade. But not much longer.</p>
<p>“It is abundantly clear that the reason for the uptick …has to do with what’s going on in Central American countries,” said an administration official on the conference call. “The federal government prepared for this trend,” an official said, “but it was larger than we had anticipated.”</p>
<p>As we continue accepting millions as the “human population escape valve” of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the third world, driven by the Catholic Church, Islamic Church and other ancient religions refuse to advocate for birth control—continues exponentially.</p>
<p>This humanitarian crisis cannot and will not end well for Americans or the migrants.</p>
<p>What needs to be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distribute birth control to third world countries.</li>
<li>Focus on the Catholic and Islamic churches to come to terms with human overpopulation in the 21<sup>st</sup> century worldwide; demand they come to terms with the 21<sup>st</sup> century and advocate for birth control.</li>
<li>Guard America’s borders to allow no one to breach our country by using our military. Force those countries to deal with their own human overload. Stop encouraging endless immigration.</li>
<li>Reduce all legal immigration into the United States to less than 100,000 annually instead of the current 100,000 every 30 days.</li>
<li>Promote a world conference on human overpopulation and all nations’ stake in providing birth control throughout the human family.</li>
<li>Interview top experts who scientifically show the end result if we fail to take destiny into our own hands.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is that destiny?</p>
<p><em>If we don’t halt population growth with justice and compassion, it will be done for us by nature, brutally and without pity – and will leave a ravaged world.  ~Nobel Laureate Dr. Henry W. Kendall</em></p>
<p>&#8220;The raging monster upon the land is population growth. In its presence, sustainability is but a fragile theoretical construct.  To say, as many do, that the difficulties of nations are not due to people, but to poor ideology and land-use management is sophistic.”  Harvard scholar and biologist E.O.

</div>
<p>What do you consider the most important issue facing America in 2014? What will affect our country more than any other challenge facing us in the 21st century? What long-term impact will change the face of America for the worse?</p>
<p>A reader said, “This is truly scary when one adds it all up like you have done. Too many people are very low in the information poll and pay no attention to what is going on in this country. I am worried so much about all of this, but the liberals of this country just continue to march on and win over us. While I am not totally committed to one party, I am truly against the party in power. I am afraid that one day it will be too late. I fear the world that my grand children will grow up in.”</p>
<p>The most important issue facing Americans in 2014: the long-term ramifications if the S744 Amnesty Bill passes in the House of Representatives. It will set in motion a human wave of 100 million immigrants injected into the United States within the next 36 years. Enough people to double the size of our top 20 most populated cities.</p>
<p>If that bill passes, it will change the face of America dramatically on our cultural, linguistic, racial, ethnic, ethos, quality of life and standard of living scale. It will impact our environment more than anyone understands.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: do I want my kids to face an added 100 million immigrants added to America in the next 36 years? What will it mean to them, their lives, their communities, their schools, their water, their environment and their country?</p>
<p>As you saw in the series “What America Will Look Like in 2050?” no amount of denial, no amount of ignoring this behemoth, no amount of technology will be able to deal with the sociological, religious and cultural impact of 100 million immigrants from 150 countries around the world.</p>
<p>Please understand that 100 million added immigrants WILL land on our shores if the current 1965 Immigration Reform Act and 1986 amnesties continue—by 2050. If S744 passes, our brilliant U.S. Senate doubled the rate of speed from 1.0 million immigrants annually to over 2.0 million annually—to increase the rate of immigration at twice the speed.</p>
<p>As one of my readers noted above, the American public does not comprehend the enormity of the numbers, the size of that number, the consequences to our environment and/or the loss of our country to what constitutes a “human typhoon.”</p>
<p>So, whatever you can do in 2014, you need to focus on visiting your senator’s office, your House of Representatives’ offices, your newspaper editors, your governor’s office, your mayor’s office and every radio and TV show you can write, call or contact by email.</p>
<p>Why? Once S744 passes, we shall have crossed the point of no return, we will have “Crossed the Rubicon” exactly like Rome’s Caesar, which led to his ultimate defeat. We shall have overrun our country with an army of humanity that we shall not be able to water, feed, house, warm, transport, work, educate or medicate.</p>
<p>Again, I give you the tools to understand the ramifications of what we face. We can stop it this year, or our children will become victims of it.</p>
<p>These two videos show graphically what it will look like:</p>
<p>In a five minute astoundingly simple yet brilliant video, <em>“Immigration, Poverty, and Gum Balls”</em>, Roy Beck, director of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.numbersusa.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNED3jeb_DBz-VHzIJCZ6AVxEEUXKg" target="_blank">www.numbersusa.ORG</a>, graphically illustrates the impact of overpopulation.  Take five minutes to see for yourself:</p>

			<p><strong>Too complex to function, too overcrowded to solve anything, too many people from too many places, too few resources&#8230;</strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/dystopiahome3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>One reader of this series asked that I write about what we face 10 years from now instead of 37 years from now. He asked me to become more “relevant” as to what our country faces.  He felt that 37 years in the future felt too far away to make any impact on Americans today.</p>
<p>The run-up to that 100 million, that’s 100,000,000 immigrants by 2050 won’t be a pretty one.  We face greater and greater consequences within 10 years by adding 30 million that will magnify to 60 million in 20 years and reach 90 million 30 years and 100 million immigrants within 37 years.  On top of that, we will add another 38 million of our own.  Total: 138 million people to feed, water, house, warm, transport, work, educate, medicate and try to maintain some kind of balance with our environment. This won’t be pretty for anyone.</p>
<p>We remain on course to become SO large that we cannot solve our problems.   To give you an example, India today suffers 1,000 children that die every 24 hours 7 days a week of water borne diseases like dysentery and diarrhea.   They die because India cannot maintain clean water from its toxic rivers, lakes and underground water supplies.  Millions upon millions of Indians urinate and defecate onto the soils in India because they lack toilets and sewage treatment plants.  Yet, they add 11 million new citizens into their society every year, year in and year out.  Most Indian people live in horrendously degraded conditions.  Air pollution, unsafe water and horribly crowded cities make life in that country a living hell.   Guess what, it’s coming to America.</p>
<p>Millions of Indians immigrated to America in the last few decades.  They arrive and then, chain-migrate their relatives through our immigration laws. They command virtually all the motel chains in America with your tax dollars being used to fund them.</p>
<p>Who can blame them?  If we give them the keys to the country, they would be fools to pass it up.  They flee a country that cannot save itself from itself.</p>
<p>When I visited India, it made me sick to my stomach to see little children starving in the cities. No one could help them because their numbers exceeded any aid.  I witnessed so much misery that I had to “harden” my emotions in order to make it through each day.  Most of Asia lives in utter misery and deprivation.  They cannot fix or solve their predicament.</p>
<p>Even more sobering, demographic experts project somewhere between 50 and 100 million refugees streaming into other countries in the next 10 to 20 years.  Africa’s desperate refugees already pour into Europe.  They overrun Spain and Greece.  As Haiti adds another projected three million to its present day nightmare, they will swim, boat and paddle their way to Florida by the hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>Dr. Jack Alpert, at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.Skil.org&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2xaNvovlR2E6YJRnOTeWZXrO0lA" target="_blank">www.Skil.org</a>, a research scientist predicts that we could see 1 billion people perish around the globe from lack of food within the next 10 years; 15 years at the most.</p>
<p>Watch these two videos:  Alpert shows where these countries lack enough water and arable land to feed their populations:</p>

<p>Do you think they will sit in their own countries and starve?  Will they wait to be saved?  Answer: No! They will migrate to Canada, America, Europe and Australia.</p>
<p>Instead of shielding ourselves from the coming nightmare facing our country, our intellectually-challenged Congress injects millions upon millions more immigrants into our country.  Whether it’s the 48.1 million Americans subsisting on food stamps today, to 100 million devouring food stamps in 30 years—something must give.</p>
<p>I can only imagine that our civilization will begin to collapse even before that 100 million legal immigrants manifest. If we do manage to hang on, it means race riots, food riots and racial separation where European-Americans flee to Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota.  Chicago, LA and Detroit portend our future.  They possess one thing in common: massive influx of legal and illegal immigrants that drive out Americans.</p>
<p>In the end, people align with their own tribes and we possess so many different tribes that we lack any cohesion within our society to maintain any rational order.  With another 100 million immigrants from all over the world, we encase a “schizophrenic society” and like Humpty Dumpty, “All the king’s horses and all the king’s men, couldn’t put Humpty Dumpty together again.”</p>
<p>As the great historian Arnold Toynbee observed that all great civilizations rise and fall, and that, “An autopsy of history would show that all great nations commit suicide.”</p>
<p>As Colorado Governor Richard D. Lamm said on the eight methods for destroying America, “First, turn America into a bilingual or multi lingual and bicultural country.  History shows that no nation can survive the tension, conflict and antagonism of two or more competing languages and cultures.  It is a blessing for an individual to be bilingual; however, it is a curse for a society to be bilingual.  The historical scholar Seymour Lipset put it this way, “The histories of bilingual and bicultural societies that do not assimilate are histories of turmoil, tension and tragedy.  Canada, Belgium, Malaysia, Lebanon—all face crises of national existence in which minorities press for autonomy, if not independence. Pakistan and Cyprus have divided. Nigeria suppressed an ethnic rebellion. France faces difficulties with Basques, Bretons and Corsicans.”</p>
<p>We write our own death sentence with passage of the S744 amnesty into law in 2014.  We face 100 million volatile, multi-language, multi-religious and multiple-cultures that lack any compatibility with our civilization.  If the sheer numbers don’t destroy us, the endless conflicting cultures will ring our death knell.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to see our country turned into a schizophrenic cultural quagmire, call Speaker of the House John Boehner at <a href="tel:1%20202%20225%200600" target="_blank">1 202 225 0600</a>:</p>
<p>“Mr. Boehner, I understand that S744 doubles legal immigration from its current 1.0 million annually to 2.0 million while giving amnesty to 12 to 20 million illegal migrants. Do you understand that such an amnesty would flood America with over 100 million immigrants by 2050—a scant 37 years from now. How will we be able to water, house, work, feed, educate, medicate and care for that many people when we already suffer 48 million Americans who cannot secure jobs and live on food stamps? How will we maintain our environment and standard of living in light of those numbers. As an American citizen, I demand that you reduce all immigration to less than 100,000 annually and enforce the laws on the books to arrest, prosecute and jail employers of illegal migrants. That will help illegal migrants to go home on their own dime when they don’t have a job. Our own unemployed citizens can take those jobs at a living wage.”</p>
<p>Also: call your own U.S. Senators and leave the same message.</p>

<p><strong>Acute water shortages, aquifers exhausted, contaminated rivers&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Few Americans understand what their children face within 37 years with the addition of 100 million immigrants to the United States of America.  The ramifications of passage of mass Amnesty Bill S.744 guarantee devastating consequences to our country.  I hope, as you read this series, you understand that your children will become victims of your apathy and inaction.</p>
<p>Instead of this crisis standing front and center at the national leadership and media levels—America’s population predicament remains the most ignored, evaded and suppressed issue of our time.</p>
<p>I’m not exactly certain why we stand in denial of the effects of adding 100 million immigrants.  You could ask the average American on the street about the implications of S744 and he or she wouldn’t possess the slightest idea of what you’re talking about.</p>
<p>As a reminder validating the reason for this series: demographic experts project the United States adding 100 million immigrants to this country by 2050—a scant 37 years from now.  All totaled, since we reached 300 million in October of 2007, we will add 138 million people by 2050 to total 438 million people—enough to duplicate 20 of our top cities’ populations to our country.  That 100 million people will have to be watered, fed, housed, transported and provided medical services. The enormity of it transcends understanding.  The Pew Research Center, U.S. Population Projections by Fogel/Martin and the U.S. Census Bureau document those demographic facts.</p>
<p>Today in America, seven states suffer water shortages in 2013: Florida, Georgia, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and California.  They may be able to water their populations at this time, but they stand on the edge of acute water shortages.</p>
<p>Florida sustains 18 million people in 2013, but demographic projections show them doubling to 36 million within 37 years—all of it because of legal immigration.  Texas, at 26 million, expects to hit 36 million by 2050.   The whopper granddaddy of them all: California holds 38 million on their way to 58 million.</p>
<p>What amazes me: no one whispers a word.  Somebody with a brain in the media or government must be pulling their hair out while wondering why the media always reports “downstream” or after the catastrophic event already occurred.</p>
<p>But when the “Water footprint” disaster hits, we will have already added 100 million immigrants.  At that point, everyone becomes victims.</p>
<p>(We pollute our drinking water with trash and chemicals all over the planet. Notice the mountain of plastic debris; but you can’t see the chemical contamination within the water.  Not until, of course, you contract cancer.)  Photography <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lightstalkers.org&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHcL1ISjG0TszetnPCx9xqmUZv92w" target="_blank">www.lightstalkers.org</a></p>
<p>“Without sustainability, ’severe’ water scarcity by 2050” By <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smartplanet.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dandrew%2Bnusca&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFETA_nGx4nJn5mxzqZRXBP10gvsg" target="_blank">Andrew Nusca</a></p>
<p>“Today, 36% of the global population — approximately 2.4 billion people — already live in water-scarce regions and 22% of the world’s GDP ($9.4 trillion at 2000 prices) is produced in water-short areas,” said Nusca. “Moreover, 39% of current global grain production is not sustainable in terms of water use.</p>
<p>“According to IFPRI’s analysis, current “business as usual” water management practices and levels of water productivity will put at risk approximately $63 trillion, or 45 percent of the projected 2050 global GDP (at 2000 prices), equivalent to 1.5 times the size of today’s entire global economy. Moreover, 4.8 billion people (52 percent of the world population) will be exposed to severe water scarcity by 2050.”</p>
<p>(This is the kind of water contamination I have seen in my world travels. Many beaches around the world feature knee deep plastic trash. Worse, most of it sinks to the bottom and disrupts ocean, river and lake eco-systems.  Yet, not one world leader or corporations calls for a 25 cent deposit-return law.)  Photography by <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lightstalkers.org&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHcL1ISjG0TszetnPCx9xqmUZv92w" target="_blank">www.lightstalkers.org</a></p>
<p>As their water shortages slam home, where do you think they flee?  Answer: first world countries.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough: these figures stand for our current 7.1 billion humans.  Projections show another 3.1 billion added to that to reach 10 billion by 2050.</p>
<p>Something will happen and it won’t be pretty.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 out of 6 people in the world lack access to clean water &#8211; that equals 1.1 billion people</li>
<li>9 million people will die this year from lack of access to clean water</li>
<li> Every 15 seconds a child dies from water related illness</li>
</ul>
<p>Exactly how do we Americans think we will escape those realities by adding 100 million immigrants?</p>
<p>(Imagine millions gallons of chemicals being dumped into America’s lakes and streams 24/7 because that’s what’s happening. Leaking gas tanks from gas stations and individual oil dumps poison our ground water. Dairy, beef, pig and chicken farms cause enormous ground water pollution.  Add another 100 million immigrants and we face humongous consequences that will become irreversible and unsolvable.)

<h1>Facts about Pollution from Livestock Farms</h1>
<h2>Livestock pollution and public health</h2>
<ul>
<li>California officials identify agriculture, including cows, as the major source of nitrate pollution in more than 100,000 square miles of polluted groundwater.</li>
<li>In 1996 the Centers for Disease Control established a link between spontaneous abortions and high nitrate levels in Indiana drinking water wells located close to feedlots.</li>
<li>Manure from dairy cows is thought to have contributed to the disastrous <i>Cryptosporidium</i>contamination of Milwaukee&#8217;s drinking water in 1993, which killed more than 100 people, made 400,000 sick and resulted in $37 million in lost wages and productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Water expert Ken Midkiff said, “In just a few short decades in the US, we have depleted our water supply. In the eastern states, which once had an abundance of water, bitter disputes and legal battles have become commonplace over water shortages caused by overpopulation. In the western states, where water has always been in short supply, population growth in dry areas has led to water shortages that threaten to severely restrict or perhaps even bar further growth.”</p>
<p>How do you “bar growth” by adding over 100 million people to America inside of four decades?</p>
<p>Just imagine with me: within 37 years, endless immigration will add 20 million immigrants to California.  Anyone want to guess the outcome of that many people on the water supplies?</p>
<p>Water is essential for all dimensions of life.  Over the past few decades, use of water has increased, and in many places water availability is falling to crisis levels. More than eighty countries, with forty percent of the world’s population, are already facing water shortages, while by year 2020 the world’s population will double. The costs of water infrastructure have risen dramatically. The quality of water in rivers and underground has deteriorated, due to pollution by waste and contaminants from cities, industry and agriculture. Ecosystems are being destroyed, sometimes permanently. Over one billion people lack safe water, and three billion lack sanitation; eighty per cent of infectious diseases.</p>

				<p>June 19, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17900#respond" title="Comment on The Illuminati Depopulation Agenda"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="17900 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17900">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><img alt="" src="http://www.redicecreations.com/ul_img/25672aurahand.jpg" align="right" />While the global elite construct underground bunkers, eat organic and hoard seeds in Arctic vaults; the global poor are being slowly starved thanks to high commodity prices and poisoned with genetically modified (GMO) food. Austerity measures aimed largely at the poor are being imposed on all the nations of the world. Weather events grow more deadly and brushfire wars more frequent. An AK-47 can be obtained for $49 in the markets of West Africa. The depopulation campaign of the inbred <i>Illuminati</i>bankers is accelerating.</p>
<p><b>In 1957 President Dwight Eisenhower</b>, who later warned of a “military-industrial complex”, commissioned a panel of scientists to study the issue of overpopulation. The scientists put forth Alternatives I, II and III, advocating both the release of deadly viruses and perpetual warfare as means to decrease world population.</p>
<p>The first supposition dovetailed nicely with the pharmaceutical interests of the Rockefellers. According to Nexus magazine, the Rockefellers own one-half of the US pharmaceutical industry, which would reap billions developing medicines to “battle” the deadly viruses about to be released.</p>
<p><b>In 1969 the Senate Church Committee discovered that the US Defense Department</b> (DOD) had requested a budget of tens of millions of taxpayer dollars for a program to speed development of new viruses which target and destroy the human immune system. DOD officials testified before Congress that they planned to produce, “a synthetic biological agent, an agent that does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could be acquired… Most important is that it might be refractory to the immunological and therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from infectious disease.” House Bill 5090 authorized the funds and MK-NAOMI was carried out at Fort Detrick, Maryland.</p>
<p>Out of this research came the AIDS virus which was targeted at “undesirable elements” of the population. The first AIDS viruses were administered through a massive smallpox vaccine campaign in central and southern Africa by the World Health Organization in 1977. A year later ads appeared in major US newspapers soliciting “promiscuous gay male volunteers” to take part in a Hepatitis B vaccine study. [1]</p>
<p><b>The program targeted male homosexuals age 20-40 in New York City</b>, Los Angeles, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco. It was administered by the US Centers for Disease Control which, under its earlier incarnation as the US Public Health Department in Atlanta, oversaw the Tuskegee syphilis experiments on African American males. [2]</p>
<p>San Francisco has been a target of numerous CIA experiments, due to its high population of left-leaning and gay citizens, which the Illuminati views as “undesirables”. According to Dr. Eva Snead, San Francisco has one of the highest cancer rates in the country. For years, malathion – first developed by the Nazis – was sprayed over the city by helicopters from the CIA’s Evergreen Air, whose Arizona base is used, according to author William Cooper, as CIA transshipment point for Columbian cocaine. The mysterious Legionnaire’s Disease occurs often in San Francisco and the CIA’s MK-ULTRA mind control bad acid program was based there.</p>
<p><b>The intellectual force behind the introduction of AIDS</b> was the Bilderberger Group, which became fixated on population control after WWII. Author Cooper says the Policy Committee of the Bilderbergers gave orders to DOD to introduce the AIDS virus. The Bilderbergers are close to the Club of Rome, which was founded on a Rockefeller estate near Bellagio, Italy and is backed by the same European Black Nobility who frequent Bilderberger meetings. A 1968 study by the Club of Rome advocated lowering the birth rate and increasing the death rate. Club founder Dr. Aurelio Peccei made a top-secret recommendation to introduce a microbe that would attack the auto-immune system, then develop a vaccine as a prophylactic for the global elite. [3]</p>
<p>One month after the 1968 Club of Rome meeting Paul Ehrlich published <i>The Population Bomb</i>. The book hints at a draconian depopulation plan in the works. On page seventeen Ehrlich writes, “The problem could have been avoided by population control…so that a ‘death rate solution’ did not have to occur.” A year later MK-NAOMI was born. Peccei himself authored the Club of Rome’s much-touted <i>Global 2000</i> report, which President Jimmy Carter pushed on his BCCI shakedown cruise of Africa. Peccei wrote in the report, “Man is now vested with unprecedented, tremendous responsibilities and thrown into the role of moderator of life on the planet- including his own”.</p>
<p>The Bilderbergers were behind the Haig-Kissinger Depopulation Policy, a driving force at the State Department and administered by the National Security Council. Pressure is applied to Third World countries to reduce their populations. Those that do not comply see their US aid withheld or are subject to Pink Plan low-intensity war that targets civilians, especially women of child-bearing age. In Africa famine and brush-fire wars are encouraged. AK-47 rifles can be bought at West African markets for under $50. The same is true in the markets of Peshawar, Pakistan. In 1975, a year after attending a Club of Rome conference on the topic, Secretary of State Kissinger founded the Office of Population Affairs (OPA).</p>
<blockquote><p>DOD officials testified before Congress that they planned to produce, “a synthetic biological agent, an agent that does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could be acquired… Most important is that it might be refractory to the immunological and therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from infectious disease.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Latin American OPA case officer Thomas Ferguson spilled the beans on OPA’s agenda when he stated, “There is a single theme behind all our work; we must reduce population levels. Either they do it our way, through nice clean methods or they will get the kind of mess that we have in El Salvador, or in Iran, or in Beirut…Once population is out of control it requires authoritarian government, even fascism, to reduce it…The professionals aren’t interested in reducing population for humanitarian reasons…Civil wars are somewhat drawn-out ways to reduce population. The quickest way to reduce population is through famine like in Africa. We go into a country and say, here is your goddamn development plan. Throw it out the window. Start looking at your population…if you don’t …then you’ll have an El Salvador or an Iran, or worse, a Cambodia”. [4]</p>
<p><b>Ferguson said of El Salvador, “To accomplish what the State Department </b>deems adequate population control, the civil war (run by CIA) would have to be greatly expanded. You have to pull all the males into fighting and kill significant numbers of fertile, child-bearing age females. You are killing a small number of males and not enough fertile females to do the job…If the war went on 30-40 years, you might accomplish something. Unfortunately, we don’t have too many instances of this to study”.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Report from Iron Mountain</b></span></p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.redicecreations.com/ul_img/25672pyramidstone.jpg" align="left" /><b>In 1961 Kennedy Administration officials McGeorge Bundy</b>, Robert McNamara and Dean Rusk, all CFR and Bilderberger members, led a study group which looked into “the problem of peace”. The group met at Iron Mountain, a huge underground corporate nuclear shelter near Hudson, New York, where CFR think tank The Hudson Institute is located. The bunker contains redundant offices in case of nuclear attack for Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell and JP Morgan Chase. [5] A copy of the group discussions, known as <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=iron%20mountain%20secret%20government&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThe_Report_from_Iron_Mountain&amp;ei=5kq_UfCKFfKgyAH1sIFw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEh7GQLQc2tW_eLgekLqZScSUyBEg" target="_blank">Report from Iron Mountain</a>, was leaked by a participant and published in 1967 by Dial Press.</p>
<p>The report’s authors saw war as necessary and desirable stating “War itself is the basic social system, within which other secondary modes of social organization conflict or conspire. (War is) the principal organizing force…the essential economic stabilizer of modern societies.” The group worried that through “ambiguous leadership” the “ruling administrative class” might lose its ability to “rationalize a desired war”, leading to the “actual disestablishment of military institutions”.</p>
<p><b>The report goes on to say, “…the war system cannot responsibly</b> be allowed to disappear until…we know exactly what we plan to put in its place…The possibility of war provides the sense of external necessity without which no government can long remain in power…The basic authority of a modern state over its people resides in its war powers. War has served as the last great safeguard against the elimination of necessary classes.”</p>
<p>Historian Howard Zinn described this conundrum when he wrote, “American capitalism needed international rivalry- and periodic war- to create an artificial community of interest between rich and poor, supplanting the genuine community of interest among the poor that showed itself in sporadic movements”.</p>
<p><b>The Iron Mountain gang was not the first to discover the virtues of war.</b> In 1909 the trustees of the Andrew Carnegie Foundation for International Peace met to discuss pre-WWI American life. Many of the participants were members of Skull &amp; Bones. They concluded, “There are no known means more efficient than war, assuming the objective is altering the life of an entire people…How do we involve the United States in a war?”</p>
<p>The <em>Report from Iron Mountain</em> goes on to propose a proper role for those of the lower classes, crediting military institutions with providing “antisocial elements with an acceptable role in the social structure.  The younger and more dangerous of these hostile social groupings have been kept under control by the Selective Service System…A possible surrogate for the control of potential enemies of society is the reintroduction, in some form consistent with modern technology and political process, of slavery…The development of a sophisticated form of slavery may be an absolute prerequisite for social control in a world at peace.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>“…the war system cannot responsibly be allowed to disappear until… we know exactly what we plan to put in its place… The possibility of war provides the sense of external necessity without which no government can long remain in power… The basic authority of a modern state over its people resides in its war powers. War has served as the last great safeguard against the elimination of necessary classes.”  </em><em><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=iron%20mountain%20secret%20government&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThe_Report_from_Iron_Mountain&amp;ei=5kq_UfCKFfKgyAH1sIFw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEh7GQLQc2tW_eLgekLqZScSUyBEg" target="_blank">Report from Iron Mountain</a></em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Iron Mountain goons, though thrilled by the idea of slavery, listed</strong> as other socioeconomic substitutions for war: a comprehensive social welfare program, a giant open-ended space program aimed at unreachable targets, a permanent arms inspection regime, an omnipresent global police and peacekeeping force, massive global environmental pollution which would require a large labor pool to clean up, socially-oriented blood sports and a comprehensive eugenics program. [6]</p>
<p>The Iraqi genocide fulfilled the dreams of the Club of Rome Zero Population Growth maniacs, while also providing a testing ground for two of the war substitutes proposed by the Iron Mountain fascists: an arms inspection regime and UN peacekeepers.  Both concepts gained traction in the international community thanks to the Gulf War.</p>

<p><strong>Estimates of Iraqi casualties during the Gulf War are sobering</strong>.  Some organizations like Greenpeace put the death toll at near one million people.  It was a war in which the media was denied access on a scale never before seen, so casualty figures vary greatly.  According to Tony Murphy, a researcher at the International War Crimes Tribunal, the US attack on Iraq killed 125,000 civilians, while destroying 676 schools, 38 hospitals, 8 major hydroelectric dams, 11 power plants, 119 power substations and half the country’s telephone lines.  The attacks occurred mostly at night when people were most vulnerable.</p>
<p>In the months following the war the death rate of Iraqi children under five tripled.  Thirty-eight percent of these deaths were caused by diarrhea. [7]  Victor Filatov, a Russian journalist reporting for <em>Sovetskaya Rossiya</em> from post-war Baghdad wrote, “What further bloodshed do these barbarians of the 20th century need?  I thought the Americans had changed since Vietnam…but no, they never change.  They remain true to themselves.”</p>
<p><strong>According to former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark, the US was found guilty</strong> of nineteen war crimes against Iraq before the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=international%20war%20crimes%20tribunal&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FInternational_Criminal_Court&amp;ei=v1q_Uf6xBKqQyQGgsIBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHrcA416NJD3FzUxz-76qj-liCvtg&amp;bvm=bv.47883778,d.aWc" target="_blank">International War Crimes Tribunal</a>.  The US dropped 88,000 tons of bombs on Iraq during the Gulf War and has rained down countless more bombs since.  Many bombs were tipped with armor piercing depleted uranium (DU) warheads, which may account for chronic Iraqi health problems.  Dr. Siegwart-Horst Gunther, a German physician who came to Iraq to help its people, became gravely ill when he handled just one cigar-sized fragment from a DU warhead.  Dr. Gunther measured the tiny object’s radioactivity to be 11 microSv per hour, whereas an acceptable exposure is no more than 300 microSv per year. [8]  Three hundred tons of DU ammunition was deployed during the war.</p>
<p>Many believe DU is responsible for Gulf War Syndrome, which has killed and permanently injured many US soldiers who fought in the Persian Gulf theater.  Since 2000, nearly 11,000 US Gulf War veterans have died from Gulf War Syndrome, while the Pentagon continues to cover up this travesty.</p>

<p><strong>Satanism &amp; Psychotronic Warfare</strong></p>
<p><strong>The US also tested numerous top-secret high-tech weapons</strong> <strong>systems</strong> in the Gulf theatre, while utilizing some old low-frequency favorites.  When Iraqi ground forces surrendered, many of them were in a state of delirium and lethargy that could have been induced by extremely low-frequency radio waves, which the US used as a weapon as early as the Vietnam conflict.</p>
<p>Yale University and CIA psychiatrist Dr. Jose Delgado studied mind control for the Company <img alt="" src="http://loveforlife.com.au/files/2neumy3.jpg" width="268" height="201" data-lazy-type="image" data-lazy-src="http://loveforlife.com.au/files/2neumy3.jpg" />during the 1950’s as part of the MK-ULTRA program.  Delgado determined, “Physical control of many brain functions is a demonstrated fact…it is even possible to create and follow intentions…By electronic stimulation of specific cerebral structures, movements can be induced by radio command…by remote control.”</p>
<p><strong>According to a military document written by Colonel Paul Valley</strong> and Major Michael Aquino titled <em>From PSYOP to Mindwar: The Psychology of Victory</em>, the US Army used an operational weapons system “to map the minds of neutral and enemy individuals and then to change them in accordance with US national interests”.  The technique was used to secure the surrender of 29,276 armed Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army soldiers in 1967 and 1968.  The US Navy was also heavily involved in “psychotronic” research. [9]  Many US soldiers who served near the DMZ that divided North and South Vietnam claimed to see UFOs on a regular basis.  <em>The Pentagon Papers</em> revealed that an electronic barrier was placed along the DMZ by the secretive <a href="http://www.redicecreations.com/article.php?id=1142" target="_blank">JASON Society</a>.</p>
<p>Major Michael Aquino was an Army psyops specialist in Vietnam, where his unit specialized in drug-inducement, brainwashing, virus injection, brain implants, hypnosis, and use of electromagnetic fields and extremely low-frequency radio waves.  After Vietnam, Aquino moved to San Francisco and founded the Temple of Set.  Set is the ancient Egyptian name for Lucifer.  Aquino was now a senior US Military Intelligence official. [10]  He’d been given a Top Secret security clearance on June, 9, 1981.  Less than a month later an Army intelligence memo revealed that Aquino’s Temple of Set was an off-shoot of Anton La Vey’s Church of Satan, also headquartered in San Francisco. Two other Set members were Willie Browning and Dennis Mann.  Both were Army Intelligence officers.</p>
<p><strong>The Temple of Set was obsessed with military matters and political fascism</strong>.  It was especially preoccupied with the Nazi Order of the Trapezoid.  Aquino’s “official” job was history professor at Golden Gate College.  The Temple recruited the same Hells Angels who Billy Mellon Hitchcock had used to dole out his bad CIA acid.  Its members frequented prostitutes where they engaged in all manner of sadomasochistic activities. [11]  Director of Army Counter-Intelligence Donald Press revealed that Dennis Mann was assigned to the 306 PSYOPS Battalion and that Aquino was assigned to a top secret program known as Presidio.</p>
<p>Presidio is also the name of a spooky complex in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which Mikhail Gorbachev reportedly frequented as the Soviet Union was falling apart.  Was Aquino part of an operation to “map the mind” of the Soviet Union’s last leader and induce him into proposing both <em>glasnost</em> and <em>perestroika</em>, the two free market policies that ultimately led to the Soviet Union’s demise?  Remember the curious mark which suddenly appeared on Gorbachev’s forehead?  Was he implanted with some sort of microchip mind-control device to make him think “in accordance with US national interests”?</p>
<p><strong>Such Orwellian technology is marketed on a regular basis throughout the world</strong>.  International Healthline Corporation and others sell microchip implants in the US, Russia and Europe.  The Humane Society has adopted a policy of micro-chipping all stray pets. The State of Hawaii <em>requires</em> that all pets be micro-chipped.  Six thousand people in Sweden have accepted a microchip in their hand, which they use for all purchases. Trials are also underway in Japan.  In July 2002, National Public Radio reported a similar trial beginning in Seattle.  Later in 2002, after a rash of suspicious abductions of young girls, BBC reported that a British company plans to implant children with microchips so that their parents can monitor their whereabouts.</p>
<p>Dr. Carl Sanders, a highly acclaimed electronics engineer, revealed that a microchip project he launched to help people with severed spinal cords was taken over by Bill Colby’s <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=bill%20colby%20%2B%20operation%20phoenix%20&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPhoenix_Program&amp;ei=OFu_UefeCKqgyAG6goGYCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNG0OWTTqoG1_WcdtidXIwaGL9YXNQ&amp;bvm=bv.47883778,d.aWc" target="_blank">Operation Phoenix </a>in a series of meetings organized by Henry Kissinger.  Sanders says the optimal spot for a microchip implant is just below the hairline on a person’s forehead, since the device can be recharged by changes in body temperatures, which are most pronounced there.  Interestingly, this is the location of the pineal gland or Third Eye.</p>
<p><strong>The 1986 Emigration Control Act grants the President the power to mandate</strong> any kind of ID he deems necessary. [12]  Researchers at Southern California have developed a chip which mimics the hippocampus, the part of the brain that deals with memory.  Pentagon officials are interested in using it in experiments to create a “super-soldier”. [13]  Another microchip called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BrainGate" target="_blank">Brain Gate</a> is being implanted in paralyzed people.  It allows them to control their environment by simply thinking. [14]</p>
<p>In Iraq, psychological warfare gave way to slow genocide.  According to UNICEF, as of late 2001, 1.5 million Iraqi children had died as a result of sanctions, while one child in ten died before their first birthday.  Thalassemia, anemia and diarrhea were the biggest killers and could have been prevented were it not for a chronic shortage of blood and medicine in Iraq due to the sanctions.  UN Committee 661 served as arbiter of what constituted a “dual use” item and therefore banned for import into Iraq.  As of 2001, over 1,600 Iraqi contracts with Western companies for medical equipment had been blocked by 661. [15]</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Yale University and CIA psychiatrist Dr. Jose Delgado studied mind control for the Company during the 1950’s as part of the MK-ULTRA program.  Delgado determined, “Physical control of many brain functions is a demonstrated fact…it is even possible to create and follow intentions…By electronic stimulation of specific cerebral structures, movements can be induced by radio command…by remote control.”</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Gulf War decimated Iraq’s sewer and water treatment systems</strong>.  Iraqis were forced to drink polluted water, leading to numerous health problems.  Iraq was not allowed to import chlorine to clean the water since 661 deemed it a potential chemical weapon.  Electrical power was rationed in three-hour daily increments per household since the Iraqi government couldn’t get the parts it needed to fix its power plants after the US bombed its entire power grid.  With the devaluation of the Iraqi <em>dinar</em> and the ban on the export of 2.4 million barrels of oil per day, the average Iraqi lived on $2.50 a month- enough to buy a pair of shoes.  The only Iraqis not affected were the wealthy elite, who had long ago stashed their savings overseas in US dollars.</p>
<p>UNICEF estimates that 28% of Iraqi children no longer went to school.  Before the war almost all children attended.  Often families could only afford to send one child to school because of the cost of simple things like backpacks, shoes and notebooks.  Rafah Salam Aziz, Director of Mansour Children’s Hospital, said parents were often forced to make similar decisions about their children’s lives.  Aziz said, “Many times it’s easier for a family to let a baby die rather than let the whole family go hungry and get sick.”[16]</p>
<p><strong>In 1996 Clinton Defense Secretary William Perry announced a new military buildup</strong> in the Persian Gulf.  Soon cruise missiles were again raining down on Baghdad.  Many nations now grew weary of both US bombing and the sanctions regime, which was brutalizing the Iraqi people while strengthening the grip of Saddam Hussein.  Russian President Boris Yeltsin, whose country signed a deal with Iraq to rebuild its shattered oil sector, said he was disturbed at the use of “extreme and radical force against the Arab world”.  The Russian opposition offered a more scalding appraisal.  Alexander Lebed stating angrily, “The US is like a strong master who spits on everybody.”[17]</p>
<p>Turkey, Jordan and Syria all expressed unease over the new round of bombing.  Even the Saudis, where Islamic fundamentalism was on the rise and two major bombings had occurred at US bases, now refused to allow the US to use its bases to bomb Iraq.  Many countries, including France, began openly flaunting the UN embargo against Iraq in the late 1990’s.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis Halliday, former Assistant Secretary of the UN </strong>who initially headed the UN Humanitarian Program to Iraq, resigned his post in protest. He said sanctions were demolishing the very class of Iraqi people who wanted to create a better government in the country.  He was scornful of the UN Oil for Food Program under which the US received 70% of Iraqi oil.  Halliday stated plainly, “We are guilty of committing genocide, through the Security Council, against Iraq.”[18]</p>
<p>Halliday’s 1998 successor was Hans Van Sponeck, who watched as the UN unfurled the UNSCOM arms inspection regime, paid for by Iraqi oil sales.  US inspector Scott Ritter confirmed Iraqi suspicions that UNSCOM was gathering intelligence for CIA and Mossad.  UNSCOM was just the latest CIA tool.  In 1996 the Iraqi government claimed international relief agencies, including the World Food Program, which claimed to be helping the Kurds, were actually CIA operatives attempting to destabilize the country.</p>
<p><strong>In fact the CIA had spent more than $20 million in its support of the Iraqi National Congress</strong>, led by long-time CIA surrogate Jalal Talibani’s PKK Kurdish faction. [19]  In January 1997 Iraq uncovered two Mossad spy rings in one month following the attempted assassination of Saddam Hussein’s son. [20]  Hans Van Sponeck had seen enough. He too resigned in protest.</p>
<p>In early 1999 it was revealed that the US had used UNSCOM to plant electronic bugging devices in the Iraqi Ministry of Defense.  Arms inspector Scott Ritter said the CIA was using UNSCOM to “provoke a crisis”.  In December 1998 UNSCOM, faced with the embarrassing accusations of espionage, pulled out of Iraq.  On December 15th the US launched a new round of bombing.  Ritter says intelligence gathered by UNSCOM was used for targeting. UNSCOM spokesman David Kay resurfaced in 2003 calling for a US invasion of Iraq. He now worked for SAIC, which landed numerous Pentagon contracts to rebuild Iraq.</p>

			<p><strong>27,000 Starvation Deaths Daily!</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/afghanchildrenpoor3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/afghanchildrenpoor2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>In this modern era, we fly jet planes around the planet in a matter of hours. We create Smart Phones that take pictures and post them on our Facebook pages in a matter of seconds.  We pay billions of dollars to watch gridiron behemoths race toward the end zone.  We buy high-powered cars to hurl our obese bodies to the local grocery store to buy more food to stuff into our mouths.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our politicians speak with soaring oratory to make the world better for all human beings.  At the same time, our leaders create wars all over the world that devour trillions of dollars in bombs, soldiers, rockets, planes and armaments.</p>
<p>But through all our riches, our words, our human nobility in 180 plus countries around the world, we cannot figure out how to stop the starvation deaths of 27,000 children every 24 hours.  How did we advance this far as the human race only to watch that many children die needlessly and endlessly around the world?  (Source: World Health Organization)</p>
<p>At the end of 2012, let’s encourage our church leaders and government leaders, and people of the world to address the fundamental need to feed the children of the planet instead of preparing for or making wars around the world. While we in the United States mourn the mayhem against the children of Newtown, Connecticut, we need to understand and solve the fact that the world suffers 27,000 “Newtown’s” every single day of the year.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s propose solutions to world hunger for 2013.  Let’s solve the great scourges of mankind: poverty, illiteracy, ignorance, disease, unemployment, homelessness, inadequate sanitation, low social mobility, and exclusion.</p>
<p>For example, in India, 1,000 children die every day of diarrhea, dysentery and other water borne diseases.  (Source: <a href="http://www.populationmedia.org/" target="_blank">www.populationmedia.org</a>) Yet, India does absolutely nothing to solve that problem while it adds another 11 million net gain to its already bloviated population of 1.2 billion impoverished people.  Not to mention its destroyed environment!</p>
<p><b>27,000 children die each day from needless poverty</b></p>
<p>Dr. Webster Tarpley, author of man books, said, “The tragic condition of humanity is perhaps most dramatically reflected in the fact that between 22,000 and 27,000 children die each day due to poverty, largely in the form of starvation, malnutrition, and diseases like diarrhea which can be cured for a few pennies. The upper end of this range corresponds to one needless childhood death caused by poverty every three seconds. Total needless childhood deaths from poverty, these data suggest, must be approaching at least 10 million per year &#8211; a yearly total which by itself rivals any of the great genocides of world history. Of the 2.2 billion children who live in today’s world, one billion live in poverty. This is the estimate from the most recent United Nations Human Development Report.”</p>
<p>Not only that, but Time Magazine reported that 8.1 million adults die annually from starvation. Total humans dying of starvation: 18 million annually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the United States spends trillions of dollars annually on war, 3.1 billion human beings live on less than $2.00 per day.  That same 3.1 billion lack a toilet or sanitation facilities of any kind. It’s beyond sickening that we see this kind of condition of humanity in 2012 with all our talents as a species.</p>
<p>“About 2.6 billion people or 40% of the world’s population are struggling to subsist on less than two dollars a day,” said Tarpley. “It is a world in which a total of 3 billion people or 50% of the world total must try to get along on less than $2.50 per day. For all the talk of a growing middle class made possible by globalization, 80% of humanity receives less than $10 per day.”</p>
<p><b>Almost a billion malnourished worldwide</b></p>
<p>According to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization in Rome, “There are in 2012 some 925 million persons experiencing hunger and malnutrition. Some 578 million of the hungry live in the Asian and Pacific countries, followed by 239 million malnourished in sub-Saharan Africa.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Americans spend $50 million per jet plane and several billions of dollars to build aircraft carriers annually that they don’t need to fight non-existent adversaries.</p>
<p>Ironically, the Catholic Church spends all its money worldwide to stop any form of birth control or family planning. In his brilliant book, <b>Underdevelopment is a State of Mind</b> by Lawrence E. Harrison, he shows where Catholic-dominated countries suffer massive child birth rates, grinding poverty and hopelessness beyond imagination.  The Catholic Church dominates in Haiti, Mexico and most of Latin America. Result: accelerating poverty to match accelerating birth rates.</p>
<p>Much the same holds true in Islamic countries like Pakistan, Egypt and Bangladesh.  Those ancient religions refuse to embrace birth control or abortion—thus, women die and children starve into that 10 million children death factor annually.  Additionally, they suffer horrific misery up to the point of death.</p>
<p><b>1.1 billion humans lack clean water</b></p>
<p>“Fully 1.1 billion people in developing countries today lack adequate access to clean water,” said Tarpley. “One third of all children, or 640 million kids, exist without adequate shelter. One fifth of all children, or a total of 400 million, do not have access to safe water. One seventh of all children, or 270 million, are denied access to adequate health services.”</p>
<p><b>Political instability in Egypt and much of Africa</b></p>
<p>Africa closes in on 1 billion human beings inhabiting that vast continent.  However, demographers state that the current rate of human growth will create 3.1 billion Africans by the end of the century.</p>
<p>In Egypt at 82 million people and headed for 150 million within decades, their form of birth control equals digging another canal off the Nile River to create more shanty tents and human misery.  No one takes responsibility for reality.</p>
<p>At some point, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Mormonism, the Catholic Church and all other religions must join minds or hands or whatever it takes—to come to terms with human overpopulation that creates the 18 million starvation deaths annually.  They must advocate and endorse birth control and family planning.  They must un-stick themselves from the 1<sup>st</sup> century or 6<sup>th</sup> century and even B.C. eras in humanity’s march into the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p>Otherwise, all those civilizations will see horrific human die-off, unspeakable misery and continued degradation of our planet home.  We cannot get around it with faith, hope or prayers.  Mother Nature, aka, God, Allah, the Great Spirit, or whatever you call the Creator will unmercifully respond to our overwhelming numbers.  It won’t be pretty.</p>
<p>We can change course by changing our actions for a plausible future for all of humanity.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/nyc-cabs-flood3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/nyc-cabs-flood2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>Today, we humans overrun and overwhelm this planet at 7.1 billion of us.  America, at a bloviated 315 million could not exist without importing 7 out of 10 barrels of oil daily from other parts of the world.  That oil will not last forever, but we will be left with a horrific population overload.  In other words, we cannot sustain our civilization in 2012 without raping some other countries around the world.  Just imagine what we face by adding 138 million people by 2050—a scant 38 years from now.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cheap oil age created an artificial bubble of plentitude for a period not much longer than a human lifetime&#8230;.so I hazard to assert that as oil ceases to be cheap and the world reserves move toward depletion, we will be left with an enormous population&#8230;that the ecology of the earth will not support. The journey back toward non-oil population homeostasis will not be pretty.  We will discover the hard way that population hyper growth was simply a side-effect of the oil age.  It was a condition, not a problem with a solution. That is what happened and we are stuck with it.&#8221;  James Howard Kunstler, <strong>The Long Emergency </strong></p>
<p>Not only that, we overrun our water supplies to such an extent that “water” will be our next sustainability predicament.  The greater our numbers, the greater our dilemma for water, irrigation and food.</p>
<p>Susan J. Marks&#8217; book, <strong>Aqua Shock: The Water Crisis in America</strong>, will give you a sobering reality check. The book presents facts, statistics, quotes, and data from sources such as the National Weather Service, United Nations, U.S. Geological Survey, and NOAA, among many other.  Marks makes a well documented case for the acute water crisis facing the world.  From Florida to Alaska, North to South Poles, South America to Africa, Iceland to Australia, and not leaving out the oceans, the author tells of the lost of drinking water and changes in precipitation patterns. Shortage and source depletion is already a major cause of border fights and legal disputes as countries, big cites, and farmland spar over water rights.</p>
<p>Because the USA expects to add 138 million people within 38 years, our water, energy, resources and arable land cannot keep up with our exploding numbers.  On top of our energy, water and resources depletion, Mother Nature continues warning us that we arrogantly explode our numbers to our own peril, i.e., Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, droughts, species extinction, climate change and acidified oceans.</p>
<p>In the end, Mother Nature speaks with a bigger stick than anyone can imagine.  My Canadian friend Tim Murray speaks about the “Nature of Mankind” and our inability to listen to the signs being given us in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Mother Nature and Mankind: A Communication Breakdown</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE RELATIONSHIP THAT COUNTS</strong></p>
<p>Tim Murray said about Mother Nature, “Perhaps you forgot about me. No wonder. Your history books seem to dwell on tyrants and dictators and megalomaniacs and the terrible things they do. Yet I can do terrible things too. Especially when I am taken for granted or abused. I know. I never commanded an army or ruled a nation.</p>
<p>“I never firebombed Hamburg, Dresden or Tokyo, nor dropped two atomic bombs. I never raped Nanking or slaughtered a third of Cambodia’s population. I never conducted a war of ethnic cleansing nor destroyed a culture and enslaved the survivors. I never committed any of these atrocities. Yet I am the most merciless and indifferent mass murderer in history.”</p>
<p><strong>I am Mother Nature. And I really think we need to talk about our relationship.</strong></p>
<p>“Not the relationship you have with other people,” said Mother Nature. “Not about whether people treat each other with enough respect or fairness or empathy. Not about whether they distribute the wealth equitably. No, this is about <strong><em>our </em></strong>relationship, the relationship between you and me, nature and humankind.</p>
<p>“You speak of coercion. Of “coercive” birth control measures, forced abortions, punitive laws, of mass imprisonment and the violation of reproductive freedom. Of force, compulsion, duress, oppression, harassment, intimidation, threats, arm-twisting and pressure by people against people.</p>
<p>“But none of this matches my power of persuasion. I am talking about <strong><em>environmental </em></strong>coercion.</p>
<p>“You can be constrained by many things in life.  You can be constrained by arthritic pain, and prevented from training for a marathon. Or constrained by your budget from doing a lot of travelling or eating out.  Or constrained by your girth from fitting into the suit you wore to the prom.”</p>
<p><strong>Environmental coercion: the most brutal of all</strong></p>
<p>“But environmental constraints brought on by overpopulation can be more confining than anything else,” said Mother Nature. “They can confine you to a small urban apartment because overpopulation has driven up the cost of shelter. They can force you remain indoors because of smog alerts. They can restrict your movement and your options because overpopulation has created a labor glut and your wages have been driven down by competition. . They can reduce your per capita share of vital resources like clean water and affordable food. Environmental coercion can make your life miserable. More miserable than the most autocratic and unjust of governments.</p>
<p>“You may think that “austerity” is a hoax. A conspiracy of bankers and CEOs and neo-liberals to rob of us our rightful entitlements. But you obviously haven’t heard the news. This is not the 1930s. This austerity is not contrived. This austerity is for real. This austerity is <em>geologically</em>, not ideologically rooted. There is not enough real wealth to go around.</p>
<p>“Go ahead and change the tax code, reform the monetary system and let the big banks fail. Make the rich pay their share. But do you think your Occupy movement can persuade me to yield more how-hanging fruit? Do you think that “justice”, “fairness”, and “equity” will suffice to make up for our non-renewable resource short falls?</p>
<p>“In just 13 years, Canadian governments will have to find $93 billion just to fund their unfunded liabilities&#8212;the promises they have made to Canadian citizens to pay out their pensions and satisfy their health care needs. All of this in addition to running other government programs and finding money to repair the infrastructure that is crumbling all around us. Newsflash: the money can’t be found by “taxing the rich”. Corporate taxes would need to double and even then, even if there was no capital flight to kinder tax climates, even if total tax revenue increased, it would be a temporary fix. In the United States, for example, if the income of every citizen making over $200,000 per year was confiscated, it would provide only enough revenue to run the federal government for just 193 days.”</p>
<p><strong>CONTINUING ECONOMIC GROWTH&#8212;NECESSARY, BUT NOT POSSIBLE</strong></p>
<p>“The only way out is continued economic growth,” said Mother Nature. “Growth at robust rates. It is only through continued economic growth that your social safety net can be maintained and your cities and bridges and physical assets can be replaced or repaired. One problem. I haven’t got enough affordably accessible natural non-renewable resources to fuel this growth. Especially when emerging economies like China and India are demanding more and more from me. Something must give. Commodity prices will skyrocket. Economic recoveries will be killed in their tracks. Conflict will ensue. Please don’t unleash a nuclear, chemical and/or biological war upon me. I have taken enough abuse already.</p>
<p>“Surely you can see this all coming. Surely you can see that the numbers don’t add up. I can’t continue to meet your growing demands. More efficient technology will not bail you out. Just ask Mr. Jevons. And be honest&#8212; renewable energy alternatives cannot be scaled up anywhere near the level you require. All you need is a calculator and an enema for your delusional optimism.</p>
<p>“But you won’t do the math. And you think your agenda trumps mine. Sorry, but didn’t you know, I <strong><em>own </em></strong>you. You are on a leash. You and your short-lived economic infidelities. Do you think I didn’t know? Do you think I didn’t notice that your mind was not on me and <strong><em>my </em></strong>needs?</p>
<p><strong>I GAVE YOU SPACE AND NOW YOU NEED MORE?</strong></p>
<p>“You tell me you need “space”. But I gave you a world of space, and what did you do with it? You filled it up with 7 billion people&#8212;- 5 billion of whom are determined to live like the other two billion do!</p>
<p>‘You tell me that universal and free access to health care, a decent pension and education is your right.</p>
<p>“But as Isaac Asimov observed, if you have 20 people sharing an apartment with two bathrooms, your “right” to guaranteed and timely access to a bathroom is necessarily limited. You can make all the speeches you want. You can run for the Democrats and make it a campaign platform if you like, or make “Freedom of the Bathroom” a Constitutional right, but without more bathrooms or fewer people in the apartment, that right is meaningless. As meaningless as the promise of sustainable Obamacare.</p>
<p>“I suggest that you seek counseling. Since I won’t provide you with the means to add more bathrooms, I suggest that you try reducing the number of people who share the apartment. Things can’t go on like this. I am calling a taxi and packing my bags. You just won’t listen, and never have. I am tired of your roving eye, your insatiable appetite and lust for more, and your lack of attentiveness. I deserve better than this&#8212;and I know that I can go it alone. You need me, but I don’t need you.</p>
<p>“I think you fundamentally misunderstand our relationship. You have the roles reversed. I am not your servant. I have only so much to give, and you’ve already blown half the dowry. So don’t come crying to me for more. And frankly dear, I really don’t give a damn about your “rights.”</p>
<p>Sincerely, Mother Nature</p>

			</div>
		
			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/bankdeeshorror3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/bankdeeshorror2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>To the next president of the United States, you face a living nightmare of a financial Katrina combined with Sandy.  Our country stands $16 trillion in debt while we wade further into deeper waters at $1 trillion more annually.  It’s a debt so deep and so wide, it can only be solved with a miracle if we expect to avoid collapse.</p>
<p>Our second president, John Adams said, “There are two ways to defeat a country: by the sword or by debt.”</p>
<p>While Obama inherited Bush’s incompetence, he passes the same debt and unemployment on to either himself or Romney.   As Einstein said, “Our problems are so great that they cannot be solved with the level of thinking that created them.”</p>
<p>On December 31, 2012, the U.S. government races toward a fiscal cliff.    It must tax the rapidly vanishing Middle Class while it rages further into a majority welfare state. </p>
<p>Congress must raise the debt ceiling past the moon or the next president will be the first in history to default on Treasury bonds.  Either way, we all face a Faustian Bargain.</p>
<p>Secondly, today one in seven American workers suffers unemployment.  A mind numbing 47 million Americans subsist on food stamps.  A full 23 percent of prime working-age men or 14 million lack full time jobs.  Another 7 million work at 20 hour per week low paying jobs. </p>
<p>For 20 years, Congress outsourced, insourced and offshored jobs to third world countries.  China, India and Bangladesh gladly employed their billions at slave wages and sold us goods that none of our factories could make as such prices.  Every product we buy from China kills an American job.</p>
<p>While countless million of Americans lost their jobs for the past 20 years, our Congress imported 20 million green card holding immigrants and continues this practice (1 million immigrants imported annually)  in 2012.  No one connects the dots.  No one points it out.  The Main Stream Media censors any discussion of this predicament.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we must look at 80 million baby boomers retiring.  Medicare and Social security cannot survive those numbers.  Most of the boomers did not prepare themselves for retirement.  The next president inherits a growing old age poverty class.</p>
<p>At some point, the Congress must raise the retirement age for Social Security benefits.  At some juncture, Americans must take care of their health better throughout their lives, i.e., over 60 percent of them suffer obesity, which they pay a severe price in old age.</p>
<p>Fourth, the debt transcends anyone’s imagination.  Consumer debt runs into the billions.  Credit card debt runs at over $9,600.00 per credit card.   Our Congress keeps borrowing $1 trillion annually.   If lenders raise their interest rates, we cannot survive the consequences.  We find ourselves limited to Hobson’s Choice. Not pretty on any level.</p>
<p>Fifth, and again, our Congress fails to deal with the China equation.  Their 1.3 billion workers make mince-meat out of our measly 300 million citizens.   They own $1.3 trillion of our Treasure bills.  We cannot compete in “Free Trade” so we hobble toward our destiny like the “Old Woman in the Shoe.”</p>
<p>While we may continue our military exploits around the world, we cannot pay for endless military expenses.   We must lean-up our military and must stop participating in foreign wars.</p>
<p>According to the International Monetary Fund, China’s output in 2017 will exceed $20 trillion.  They will bury us unless we demand “Fair Trade” instead of debt-laden “Free Trade.”</p>
<p>Finally, while journalists and politicians eschew in-depth discussion about this subject, but it commands our attention. Christopher O. Clugston, author of Scarcity: Humanity’s Final Chapter, addresses the fact that humanity depletes the non-renewable resources on this finite planet at an ever accelerating rate of speed.  We add 1 billion humans every 12 years.  The USA races on course to add 100 million by 2035 and 138 million by 2050.  So much so, the costs of energy, water, food and resources will continue to climb. He says, “Because the natural resource utilization behavior that enables our current “success”—our industrialized way of life—and that is essential to perpetuating our success—is simultaneously undermining our very existence.  Neither our natural resource utilization behavior nor our industrial lifestyle paradigm is sustainable.  This is our predicament.”</p>
<p>One last thought:  Hurricane Katrina wrought catastrophic mayhem.  Hurricane Sandy ripped up the East Coast.  If we, as a species, continue cooking up the planet with our fossil fuel burning, along with accelerating overpopulation—we face Mother Nature’s growing wrath as to climate destabilization.  She always bats last and could care less who cheers or who lives in her path.  </p>
<p>Good luck to the next president.  You’re going to need it if our civilization is to survive what’s coming.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/risingfoodprices3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/risingfoodprices2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>When it comes to proactive action as to feeding, watering and housing America’s burgeoning population, most of America’s leaders fell asleep at the wheel and continue their slumber into 2012.  Not one single, solitary senator, House member or the United States of America’s president will connect carbon footprint, overpopulation or our enormous burning of 22 million barrels of oil daily—with global climate destabilization.  Globally, humans burn 84 million barrels of oil and billions of tons of coal daily. </p>
<p>Our carbon footprint grows beyond comprehension.  It heats up the atmosphere. It acidifies our oceans. It creates an imbalance for all living creatures on Earth.</p>
<p>No matter how much drought, heat waves and tornadoes scorch and destroy areas around the United States; everyone stands like deer in the headlights in denial of the oncoming train.  It’s fascinating to watch mass denial, collective myopic behavior and vacant leadership.</p>
<p><strong>The United States is horrifically overpopulated and unsustainable</strong></p>
<p>Publisher Marilyn Hempel of the Population Press, <a href="http://www.populationpress.org">www.populationpress.org</a> , encourages top leaders to educate Americans to what we all face in the future if we continue down our endless growth path.</p>
<p>In this piece, imminent environmental leader and author of Plan B, 4.0, Saving Civilization, Lester Brown speaks about our rising temperatures.</p>
<p>“Over the last two months, the price of corn has been climbing,” said Brown. “On July 19th, it exceeded $8 per bushel for the first time, taking the world into a new food price terrain. With heat and drought still smothering the Corn Belt, we may well see more all-time highs in coming weeks as the extent of crop damage becomes clearer. This is not the way it was supposed to be. This spring farmers planted a record 96 million acres of corn. An early spring got the crop off to a great start, leading the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to project the largest corn harvest in history.</p>
<p>“On June 12th, the USDA projected the U.S. harvest would hit a record 376 million tons. But the drought conditions that had initially been confined to the country’s southwest began to spread and intensify. In its next monthly report on July 11th, the USDA reduced its projection to 329 million tons of corn, down by 12 percent or 47 million tons. This was a huge drop in only one month. Yet in the end the actual decline may be closer to 30 percent, or roughly 100 million tons—double the USDA estimated drop.”</p>
<p>Why is this happening?  Answer: the crops are being cooked in the soil via heat and no rain.  Has that prompted humans to lower their fossil fuel burning?  On the contrary, humans burn more and more each day as they add a 250,000 more members to the human heard and 80 million net gain annually.</p>
<p>“There are several reasons for the large reduction in the harvest estimate. One is record high temperatures,” said Brown. “Nationwide, the first half of this year was the hottest on record. Thousands of record daily temperature highs were set locally. In St. Louis, Missouri, which is in the southern part of the U.S. Corn Belt, in late June and early July there were 10 consecutive days with temperatures of 100–108 degrees.</p>
<p>“Intense heat also disrupts pollination. Corn is particularly vulnerable because of its complex pollination system. The tassel at the top of a corn plant releases pollen, which must fall on each strand of silk coming out of the ear of corn and travel to the kernel site, where fertilization occurs. If it is too hot, the silk will turn brown and dry out, leaving the pollen with no chance of reaching its destination.”</p>
<p>Brown continued, “What happens to the U.S. corn crop, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of the global harvest, concerns the entire world. Of the big three grains—corn, wheat, and rice—the corn harvest is now by far the largest, totaling near 900 million tons compared with less than 700 million tons for wheat and 460 million tons for rice. Wheat and rice are the world’s food staples, while corn is the feedgrain for livestock and poultry.</p>
<p>“We are looking at a future of rising food prices driven by rising temperatures. Heat waves and droughts like that of 2012 in the United States are projected to become more frequent as the planet heats up. Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), a heat-trapping gas, have increased 20 percent since 1970 and are continuing to rise.”</p>
<p><strong>Humanity faces growing food shortages as its numbers grow by 80 million annually and 1 billion added every 12 years</strong></p>
<p>“A report published by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences concluded that if atmospheric CO2 climbs from the current level of 391 parts per million (ppm) to above 450 ppm, the world will face irreversible rainfall reductions in several regions,” said Brown. “The study likened the conditions that will develop to those of the U.S. Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Already the world’s drought-afflicted area has expanded from below 20 percent of total land area a half century ago to closer to 25 percent in recent years. Future food security may depend more on new energy and population policies than on any agricultural policy we can conceive.”</p>
<p>Brown says that we don’t know the unchartered territory that we blindly and at our own folly continue speeding toward.  The human race expects to add three billion more people to the planet within 38 years, but doesn’t have a clue as to how to feed that enormous human herd.  Americans need to rethink immigration, population, water, food and resources before they find themselves in the same boat as current day India, Mexico, China and Indochina.  The United States needs to boldly, methodically and intelligently move toward a mandated “national stabilized population policy” in order to give future generations a chance at a reasonable life of food, resources, water and energy.</p>
<p>How will the United States feed, water, warm and house its own additions of 138 million people in the face of prolonged droughts?  Answer: we won’t.  That’s why we need to change course.</p>

				<p>April 13, 2012 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=14414#respond" title="Comment on Big Mistakes Paul Ehrlich Made On Human Overpopulation"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="14414 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=14414">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
			</div>
		
			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/overpopulationglobe3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/overpopulationglobe2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>While some of the great minds in history wrestled with humanity’s ability to feed itself, the general populace doesn’t understand nor does it possess a clue as to what we face in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.  Humans race toward adding another three billion to the current seven billion to reach 10 billion in less than 40 years.  Malthus, Darwin, Ehrlich, Heinberg, Bartlett, Alpert and other giants understood/understand humans’ ability to overpopulate their ability to feed themselves.</p>
<p>Even the green revolution man stated it concisely.  Norman Borlaug, <a title="" href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1970/borlaug-lecture.html" target="_blank">while accepting the Nobel peace prize in 1970</a>, said: &#8220;The green revolution has won a temporary success in man&#8217;s war against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space. If fully implemented, the revolution can provide sufficient food for sustenance during the next three decades. But the frightening power of human reproduction must also be curbed; otherwise the success of the green revolution will be ephemeral only.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet, I receive incredibly chastising letters from religious, emotional, clueless and scientifically out of touch individuals weekly about how humanity will find new energy through technology, etc.  Much of it is as mythical as the second coming of Jesus, Buddha, Krishna and other great teachers of the path that have been anointed as “gods” themselves instead of what they were—simple men of the spirit.<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>Dr. Paul Ehrlich suffered much criticism with his Population Bomb in 1968.  He made predictions that have manifested as 18 million humans starve to death annually. Nonetheless, his detractors love to fault him. But they can’t!   Borlaug nailed it and we must deal with it.</p>
<p>Weekly, I participate in a very special discussion with over 100 of the top minds in the country on environment and overpopulation.  My friend, David Paxson, director of <a href="http://www.worldpopulationbalance.org/" target="_blank">www.worldpopulationbalance.org</a> spoke recently and he enjoyed some feedback.</p>
<p>David, I listened to the radio interview. I thought you did an excellent job; however I think you have some rough spots that can be improved upon.  The critic is John Taves:</p>
<p>1) One example is where you pointed out the mistake that Paul Ehrlich made when he predicted dire consequences in a certain time frame. I totally agree with you that that was a mistake. Ehrlich should not have made predictions. My point is that you subsequently made the exact same mistake when you said that Ehrlich&#8217;s predictions are NOW coming true. There is no need to state that they are now coming true.</p>
<p>2) When she said &#8220;some people say that the planet will take care of the population numbers&#8221;, I thought your answer was weak. I prefer something along these lines.</p>
<p>Of course the planet will limit our numbers, but that is NOT a solution, that is the problem. If we continue to create babies faster than people die of old age, nature will be forced to stop the population growth by killing people faster, and at least fast enough to keep up with how fast we create new babies. But it is worse than that. We must consume oil, for example, in order to feed our current 7 billion. If we do not burn oil, we cannot produce food fast enough to feed ourselves. You can imagine the oil reserves are stock piles of food. As that stock pile of food runs out, our numbers must decrease because we have no ability to keep 7 billion alive without digging into that pile of food.</p>
<p>In addition, your answer was technically wrong when you said that the planet is not limiting the growth today. This is not terribly important for the audience you were speaking to in that interview, but it is a huge problem with experts. Nature IS limiting the growth and generally always has been limiting our numbers. Populations grow exponentially, and humans have been around for a long time, thus our numbers have always been throttled by nature. There are temporary exceptions to this.</p>
<p>For example, when humans discovered farming techniques, we raised the limit of what can be provided for and our numbers grew to the new limits. A more recent example is what has happened in North America for the past 500 years. European diseases decimated the native population numbers and for the next 500 years improved techniques for providing for our numbers have ensured that the limits of what can be provided for have expanded faster than the population has grown. The population numbers in NA have not yet caught up to what can be provided for (notice &#8220;provided for&#8221; is not the same as &#8220;can be sustained&#8221;, which means I totally agree that we are overpopulated).</p>
<p>However, Ethiopia and many other countries that are suffering a replacement rate above 2, are indeed experiencing the horror of nature limiting their numbers. The limit has not been a hard cap. The numbers are increasing, but the numbers are not increasing as fast as they would if the area was well below what could be provided for. In short, deaths are occurring today because of the fact that too many births are happening today. That last sentence is the key point. We have to recognize that births above a certain rate, cause deaths, and we have to recognize that we have always been above that rate. As part of the &#8220;overpopulation education&#8221; that you are advocating, I am trying to insert the fact that we must recognize that births cause deaths.</p>
<p>You seemed to acknowledge this later when you spoke about the horrible conditions in many poor countries, but then you seemed to disagree with it when you cited the fact that the recent huge population growth was caused by the decrease in the death rate. There is a subtle error when demographers tell us that for much of human history the birth rate and the death rate matched each other and thus our numbers did not grow.</p>
<p>This statement is true, but it suggests that this was good and that somehow the birth rate magically matched the death rate. It makes much more sense to say that whenever you see a stable population and an uncontrolled birth rate, the death rate was forced to rise to match the birth rate. It is true that nature also lowers the birth rate, but it does this by totally unpleasant means. The point I am making is that we humans did not throttle our birth rate, thus nature throttled our population numbers by raising the death rate. The subtle rephrasing that I just did is very important to get the message across that we have a moral responsibility to limit our births.</p>
<p>3) Your answer to the man that suggested that we should all become vegetarians was too long and inefficient. You should have said something like the following: Yes, we can all become vegetarians, and drive Priuses and use CFLs, but none of that will solve the problem if we continue to create babies faster than people die of old age. So consuming less per capita is not a solution. If we recognize that we must not create babies faster than old age, it should be possible to limit our birth rate even lower such that our numbers decrease. If we can do that, there&#8217;s no reason that our population numbers should level off at some number where we are just able to sustain ourselves as long as we eat no meat. Why not maintain that lower birth rate for more time such that our numbers drop well below that level, so that there is no problem eating meat?</p>
<p>You sort of comprehended this when you made it clear that by going vegetarian, and Prius, and CFLs, we simply enable a larger population. But you were not terribly crisp in making the point that ultimately the birth rate is the only possible solution.</p>
<p>The Oregon study you quoted is a fine example of a muddy point. Ultimately that study makes no sense. You stated that the study concludes that the birth of another child is 20 times more costly than other options. That study is attempting to tell us the cost of adding another human to the world. To do that they have to make an assumption about the birth rate, which is the exact thing that the study&#8217;s information will affect. I am going to use a better definition of &#8220;birth rate&#8221; to explain this. Ask each adult right before they die how many children they created. Each person will be counted twice. Once by the mother and once by the father. This number is what I call &#8220;the average number of children&#8221;.</p>
<p>If the study assumes that the average number of children is above 2, the additional birth is meaningless. The population is attempting to grow to infinity, thus the cost of the additional human is infinite. It is not 20x. If the average number of children is below 2, then the additional birth is also meaningless, it won&#8217;t change the fact that the population will go to zero. In short, you cannot put a finite cost to the existence of another human. If that human&#8217;s descendants average more than 2, then the cost is infinite.</p>
<p>You talked about how we all need to have an overpopulation education and I totally agree. Part of that education will be new definitions. For example, the definition of birth rate that demographers use is pathetic. Births per 1000 is the demographer&#8217;s unit of measure. It does not matter what &#8220;births per X&#8221; you use. The &#8220;per x&#8221; shifts the concept to the wrong units. The concept we must get to is found in the definition I created. The definition of &#8220;average number of children&#8221; allows us to &#8220;go up stream&#8221; as you put it. The &#8220;upstream source&#8221; of all of this is how many children we average. If we average more than two, we cause our numbers to <em>attempt </em>to grow to infinity. Thus we have a moral obligation to NOT average more than two.</p>
<p>In the end, Dr. Paul Ehrlich is dead on the money and so is Malthus, Bartlett, Heinberg, Catton, Darwin and more.</p>

<p>If animals or humans exceed ‘carrying capacity’ of any given land mass, they crash in numbers by various means, i.e., famine, war and disease.  Garrett Hardin, noted biologist called it, “The Tragedy of the Commons.”  (Source:<a href="http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/" target="_blank">www.GarrettHardinSociety.org</a>)</p>
<p>For the 7.1 billion humans in the 21<sup>st</sup> century and headed for 10.2 billion in 40 years, oil resources will define that capacity quotient.  Noted Geologist Walter Youngquist said, “This is going to be an interesting decade, for the perfect storm is brewing—energy, immigration and oil imports.  China grows in direct confrontation for remaining oil.  I think the USA is on a big, slippery downhill slope.  Will the thin veneer of civilization survive?” To see how fast we grow, visit<a href="http://www.populationmedia.com/" target="_blank">www.populationmedia.com</a></p>
<p>“Cassandra Syndrome”: The Cassandra Syndrome is a term applied to predictions of doom about the future that are not believed, but upon later reflection turn out to be correct. This denotes a <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological<br />
Psychological" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological" target="_blank">psychological</a> tendency among people to disbelieve inescapably bad news, often through denial. The person making the prediction is caught in the dilemma of knowing what is going to happen but not being able to resolve the problem.  The origin of the name is derived from <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra<br />
Cassandra" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra" target="_blank">Cassandra</a>, who, using her prescience, foresaw the demise of Troy. No one believed her.</p>
<p>Youngquist continued, “Beyond oil, population is the number one problem of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, for when oil is gone as we know and use it today—and it WILL be gone—population will still be here.”</p>
<p>The world uses 84 million barrels daily.  That’s 42 gallons to a drum.  By mid century, China, now placing 27,000 new cars on its highways every seven days, expects to burn 98 million barrels of oil daily—all by itself!  Oil will run out because of limited reserves in the ground. (Source: The Long Emergency by James Howard Kunsteler)</p>
<p>Dr. Albert Bartlett of the University of Colorado said, “Present population growth rate is putting our children at risk.  They will experience holes in the ozone causing serious biological effects on plants and humans.  World ocean fisheries are collapsing from endless plundering.  Two thirds of the world’s people will suffer from water shortages by 2025.  It is not possible to sustain population growth or growth in rates of consumption of resources.”</p>
<p>Where is the worst overpopulation problem on the planet according to Dr. Bartlett?  “It’s right here in the United States!”</p>
<p>Dr. Bartlett said, “Can you think of any problem, on any scale, from microscopic to global, whose long-term solution is in any demonstrable way, aided, assisted, or advanced, by having continued population growth—at the local level, the state level, the national level, or globally?”</p>
<p>How many people in the United States are enough?  How far down the gopher hole do we want to dig ourselves?  At what point is enough—too much?  If we shut down the borders today with zero immigration, while enjoying our sustainable 2.03 fertility level of American women on average, we would still grow via “population momentum” by an added 40 million.</p>
<p>In other words, we’re painting ourselves into a perilous corner. Once the numbers manifest, our society will suffer irreversible consequences with unsolvable problems.  One visit to Los Angeles will show you they suffer toxic air, dwindling safe drinking water, gridlock to the point of insanity, water shortages, endless highways and housing development.  Consider San Francisco, Atlanta, Chicago, New York, Detroit, Denver and all other large cities grow beyond the bounds of reason!</p>
<p>Sustainable growth, slow growth, managed growth, smart growth and all other kinds of growth are oxymoronic.  There is no such thing as sustainable growth.  Why? All growth exceeds carrying capacity at some point.  In other words, the bubble bursts, the dam breaks, the glass spills, the balloon pops and the red-lined engine blows up.</p>
<p>“Population growth is given as a cause of the problems identified, but eliminating the cause is not mentioned as a solution,” Bartlett said. “We are prescribing aspirin for cancer.”</p>
<p>At the current rate of growth driven by immigration, America will double its population just past mid century—from 300,000,000 to 600,000,000.  As long as the underlying cause of a problem is not dealt with, we, and our leaders, as a nation, perpetuate a falsehood which Mark Twain called ‘silent-assertion’:  “Almost all lies are acts,” he said.  “I am speaking of the lie of ‘silent-assertion’.  It would not be possible for a humane and intelligent person to invent a rational excuse for slavery; yet you will remember that in the early days of emancipation in the North, agitators got small help from anyone.  They could not break the universal stillness that reigned from the pulpit and press all the way down to the bottom of society&#8211;the clammy stillness created and maintained by the lie of silent-assertion that there wasn’t anything going on in which intelligent people were interested.</p>
<p>“The conspiracy of the silent-assertion lie is hard at work always and everywhere, and always in the interest of a stupidity (unlimited growth) or sham (unlimited immigration), never in the interest of the respectable (average citizens).  It is the most timid and shabby of all lies.  The silent-assertion is that nothing is going on which fair and intelligent men and women are aware of and are engaged by their duty to try to stop.”</p>
<p>Silent-assertion worked until it brought China, India and Bangladesh to their knees with sheer misery of numbers.  How do I know?  I’ve spent a lot of time in Asia and other overpopulated regions.  China, even with enforced one child per family, grows by 8 million annually. India, with 1.2 billion, adds 12 million yearly.  Bangladesh suffers 157 million people in a landmass the size of Iowa.  Do you see anyone racing to immigrate to those havens of human overload?</p>
<p>What I ask is, do we as a nation, want millions upon millions of added people from countries already exceeding their carrying capacity?  Legal immigration proves as dangerous as illegal.  To think otherwise will allow that silent-assertion to create another China or India in America.  Just imagine Iowa with 157 million people and all the rest of the United States with THAT kind of population density!</p>
<p>Albert Einstein said, “The problems in the world today are so enormous they cannot be solved with the level of thinking that created them.”</p>
<p>We are no longer living in the 20<sup>th</sup> century America with only 75 million people riding horses or trains.  We’re in the 21<sup>st</sup>century with cars and jets and 315 million people added to the 7.1 billion on the planet&#8211;creating horrific environmental consequences.  Again, we had to change our ‘silent-assertion’ about slavery and we MUST change our ‘silent-assertion’ about population growth and economic growth.  If we continue steaming full speed ahead like the captain of the Titanic, our children will be on board when we hit the peak oil, global warming, ozone holes, collapsing species, air pollution and other commensurate problems related to the overpopulation “iceberg.”  Most died on the Titanic because there weren’t enough life boats.</p>
<p>Maybe some of us choose to maintain our ‘silent-assertion’ in the face of growing consequences, but how can any parent or grandparent be that callous to their children?</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/ecology-and-capitalism3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/ecology-and-capitalism2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Contrary to everything we have been taught, there is no actual United States of America. The U.S. is an occupied territory that could more accurately be described as the Corporate States of America. If the geopolitical states are united, the people are not. We are a nation divided by ideology and by social and economic class. The U.S. is not a democracy and it never was. The systems of power do not allow the voice of working people to be heard or their collective will to be acted upon.</p>
<p>Despite the subterfuge of freedom and democracy, the rights of corporations have consistently superseded the sovereign rights of the individual and those of the community. Labor history and a litany of environmental catastrophes bear this out. For instance, everywhere one looks government agencies, ostensibly created to protect the public welfare, are allowing hydraulic fracturing of Marcellus shale, even when it poisons municipal drinking water and causes incalculable harm to the environment.</p>
<p>Our diverse forests are commodified, measured in board feet to be clear-cut and off-shored at prodigious bargain rates, like a liquidation sale. World class biodiversity is yielding to desertification and monoculture. Money changes hands. The few are getting rich at the expense of the many. The world and the people who live in it are treated like products to be exploited. We are told that nothing is sacred, save for the dollar and markets.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is an inescapable fact that no human being, including corporate CEOs and members of Congress, can live without potable water or breathable air. We are literally sacrificing the Earth’s life support systems and mortgaging the future, while attempting to satiate the greed of a few grotesquely wealthy individuals. Through lifelong indoctrination, Americans are persuaded that self-interested greed is in their best interest.</p>
<p>The rich and powerful have decreed that corporate profits, the Holy Grail of American capitalism, are more precious than life itself. The remorseless people in power are without conscience. History confirms that sociopaths do not hesitate to take what they want from their unsuspecting victims by any and all means.</p>
<p>But surely, even among Friedmanites, it must be allowed that some things cannot be commodified or bought and sold. For instance, clean air and potable water are the birthright of every living organism. These are necessities that belong to the commons; they cannot ethically be privately owned. In contrast to this assertion, two edicts of modern capitalism are private ownership and the commodification of workers and nature.</p>
<p>Capitalism, and the market fundamentalism that is associated with it, has stripped bare the Earth’s biodiversity and substituted a world of commodities in its stead. What we see and think we know is not real. It is the product of marketing and perception managers—a hologram.</p>
<p>There is growing conflict between capitalism and the planet’s ecology, its essential life support systems. A fierce struggle between capital and democracy is in progress. The booted foot of capitalism is pressing upon the throat of democracy. We inhabit a dying world and are inheriting dying freedoms. Corporate greed and over-population is the culprit. Conflict is everywhere.</p>
<p>Virtually all of the social upheaval, inequality, and environmental problems of today in some way ensue from capitalism, including overpopulation and armed aggression. Capitalism requires continuous economic expansion and a burgeoning market for consumers. This is simply not possible on a finite planet.</p>
<p>These tensions are manifested no more clearly than throughout the coal belt and mountains of West Virginia, where I make my home. Here, mountains are cleared of forests before being blown to smithereens in order to cheaply extract coal to enrich Massey Energy Corporation. The process, known as mountaintop removal, has poisoned streams, altered their courses, and changed the contours of the land and its hydrology. It has devastated both human and biological communities while filling the coffers of the timber and coal industries.</p>
<p>Conventional underground mining has claimed the lives of thousands of coal miners trying to scratch out a modest living from the Earth. At times, it has led to armed conflict between miners and the Pinkertons hired by the mining companies in places like Matewan and Blair Mountain.</p>
<p>In West Virginia, King Coal and the gas and oil industry run the state’s legislature. The government is effectively owned by corporate lobbyists. As a result, it is futile to make legal and moral appeals to government for redress of our grievances. If we limit ourselves to the tools that our oppressors provide us, the entire region will become a sacrifice zone. Working people and the poor make the sacrifices; billionaires and industry carry off the profit. We are left to deal with the aftermath.</p>
<p>The illusion of democracy, including voting in the absence of meaningful choice, is a poor substitute for direct action and anarchy. Democracy cannot flourish in the sterile soil that capitalism leaves in its wake. Either we have democracy or we have capitalism, or we create something entirely different. Radically opposing ideas cannot be reconciled.</p>
<p>Modern humans inhabit a human-engineered world of absurdities and contradictions. Regardless of the Supreme Court’s assertions, corporations are not people, and money is not speech. Every sentient human being knows this. However, the law says otherwise. We must deny the corporate state that victory by refusing to capitulate.</p>
<p>The struggle for community rights, egalitarianism, and social, economic, and environmental justice must occur outside of the system that creates inequality and fosters wanton destruction of the commons. Countless species of plants and animals that provide essential ecological services are being eliminated to create space for strip malls, gated communities, gambling casinos and golf courses. As a result, ecological and economic catastrophe loom. We are facing global famine in an anthropocentric over-heated world.</p>
<p>Globally, wealthy multi-national corporations are gorging themselves on the biological and mineral wealth of the commons. What could be more absurd or unethical?</p>
<p>The brainchild of Adam Smith, capitalism, which replaced feudalism during the French Revolution, is founded upon demonstrably false premises, many of which were unknown in Smith’s time. Nevertheless, classically-trained economists assert that capitalism is a primal force of nature rather than the defective human construct that it is. Modern capitalism has produced pathological symptoms and endorsed an ethos that is antithetical to life and to liberty. It is killing the world and foreclosing evolutionary possibilities.</p>
<p>Indeed, ethical considerations aside, and speaking purely from a biological perspective, one may emphatically state that modern capitalism is an aggressive cancer that is devouring its host. But most of us are in denial. People like me are asked not to utter the “C” word in public spaces. It might offend the well-intentioned believers. Whenever this occurs I am reminded of Thoreau, who uttered, “Any truth is better than make believe.” One has an ethical obligation to state what one knows succinctly and clearly.</p>
<p>It is not in dispute that the ideology of constant expansion on a finite planet is contradicted by inviolable ecological dictums—among them, carrying capacity, ecological overshoot, and die-off. But classical economists act as if these laws do not apply, or they are mysteriously overridden by the irrational exuberance of capitalism.</p>
<p>In reality, every political economy is underlain by ecology and by living, evolving, biological systems. Ecology is the only economy that really matters.</p>
<p>By possessing even a modest degree of ecological literacy, one can make some revealing predictions with mathematical certainty. For example, the continuation of capitalism as the primary political economy can have one of two possible outcomes: the virtual destruction of the biosphere, meaning the death of the host organism, or the abolition of the capitalist system.</p>
<p>What would a post-capitalism world look like and how might it work?</p>
<p>Global capitalism, with its dependence on the availability of cheap fossil fuels and petrochemicals for food production, must give way to small-scale local economies and organic agriculture. Food must be locally grown and, as far as possible, other necessities locally produced. The age of cheap fossil fuels is ending. Industrialized man must bravely confront his addictions and embrace sobriety or he will self-destruct.</p>
<p>It is said that nature bats last. Humans do best when they emulate natural systems that have evolved over eons of time.</p>
<p>A moneyless economy based upon need must supplant the current profit-driven system of exploitation. Accordingly, goods and services may then be exchanged without the conduit of markets. These exchanges would be of equal value and thus inherently fair.</p>
<p>The classic business models will be replaced by worker-owned and worker-operated cooperatives. In this arrangement, workers—not a board of directors—make all of the business decisions. They share the risks and benefits and distribute the surpluses of production, while significantly reducing the work day and the work week. A portion of the surpluses of production is allocated to the betterment of the community and to the protection of the commons.</p>
<p>New economic models must be predicated upon ecological principles or they will fail. Existing alternatives to capitalism, such as Spain’s Mondragon Worker Cooperative, must be critically analyzed and evaluated as a model that could, with modifications, be implemented elsewhere.</p>
<p>There is no better teacher than evolution and natural selection. History confirms that the most revolutionary ideas are occasionally the oldest. For instance, anthropological studies indicate that early Homo sapiens evolved by implementing egalitarian principles into their tribal clans. People and the cultures they create must either evolve or perish.</p>
<p>The egalitarian societies of the future will look radically different from the capitalism of today. Political campaigns and elections will recede into history and quickly forgotten. Evolved societies do not need leaders or elected officials.</p>
<p>Every member of an egalitarian community is a leader. Power flows in a circular form rather than a linear, top-down hierarchy. It is derived directly from the people. There will be no social or economic stratification. No one shall have privileges or rights that are denied to others. Every member of the community must be equally empowered and equally valued. All people will have equal access to opportunity. Healthcare and higher education, like pure water and clean air, will be regarded as a right of birth and provided without cost.</p>
<p>Direct action will replace voting in political elections. Rather than consent to be governed, sovereign people can create the world they want to live in. In communities where people are empowered and where they have an equal stake, they will want to participate. Everyone brings something to the table. Everyone contributes and all of society benefits.</p>
<p>Communities will become as interconnected and interdependent as ecological systems. But each will remain autonomous within the larger matrix of nature. States and nations as we know them may eventually recede into history and disappear.</p>
<p>Rather than the callous competition and exploitation nurtured by capitalism, communities can be organized around the principle of cooperation and social need. As in healthy ecosystems, the welfare of the individual is dependent upon the well-being of the community—and vice versa. No one will be left behind. All of us shall rise together.</p>
<p>All living organisms share a common origin and a common destiny. Ecology and economy must merge into an integrated natural system suited to long-term survival in a world already ravaged by industrialized man. Ecological and social healing must be part of the process of building sustainable communities.</p>
<p>The transition from capitalism to cooperation will be neither smooth nor easy. There will be many false starts. At first, there will be fierce resistance to revolutionary change. People cling to the familiar and the comfortable, to what they know, even when the dominant paradigm and popular culture does them harm.</p>
<p>The first tentative steps of a journey are often the most difficult. There are no clear blueprints to follow. There will be trepidation and uncertainty. But we must commit to beginning. The alternative is oblivion. But if we embark on the voyage the survival of the species, and a new age of enlightenment will be possible.</p>

			<p>The Left, including the communists have generally served as the useful idiots of international capital &#8230; The Left, whether in its Fabian, communist or New Left  varieties has been appropriated by the system it is supposedly exposing.</p>
<p>A self-appointed elite that Huxley called the &#8216;World Controllers&#8217; and Caroll Quiqley described as &#8216;an international network&#8217; has for generations been intent on establishing a &#8216;World State&#8217; (Huxley) or what David Rockefeller calls a &#8216;World Order&#8217; and and what President George W. Bush and others &#8230;call the &#8216;New World Order.&#8217;</p>
<p>In more common parlance it is called &#8216;globalization&#8217; but it is seldom understood in its wider ramifications, as set forth here, especially by the Left, whose activists support  aspects of the same globalization process: multiculturalism, feminism, marijuana liberalization, abortion rights, open borders, and feel-good causes in the name of democracy and &#8216;human rights,&#8217;  the results of which are further control by the global plutocracy.</p>
<p>The Left, including the communists have generally served as the useful idiots of international capital &#8230; The Left, whether in its Fabian, communist or New Left  varieties has been appropriated by the system it is supposedly exposing. A post- New Left has emerged since the dissolution of the Soviet Bloc, and takes the form of the so-called &#8216;color revolutions&#8217; under the patronage of the Soros network, and others.</p>
<p>The strategy  used by the international oligarchy is the same as that more generally recognized as being a major element in Marxist doctrine; namely <em>dialectics,</em> the conflict of opposing forces that generates a <em>synthesis. </em>This dialecto method is something that Sutton realized when he was trying to understand why the oligarchy so often seems to be backing opposing ideologies, governments, and policies.</p>
<p>The Marxist dialecticians stated that history is engaged in a process towards world communism that would arise out of the conflict of capitalism and socialism. The oligarchs, on the other hand, apparently operate on the dialectical premise that what will result from their &#8220;controlled conflict&#8221; will be a socialist-capitalist synthesis which we might call the &#8220;World Collectivist State;&#8221;  a world order that will be Communistic in organization but run by oligarchs rather than commissars. Aaron Russo, after talking with Nick Rockefeller, alluded to this as &#8220;selling socialism as capitalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the past few generations, the &#8220;crises scenarios&#8221; used by the oligarchs to sell or impose their plan of a World Collectivist State have included the problems of war, famine, overpopulation, disparity between the wealth of the so-called &#8220;North&#8221; and &#8220;South&#8221; , and in our present time &#8220;the war on terrorism&#8221; (perpetual conflict) and the threat of &#8220;global warming.&#8221;</p>
<p>In general, it can be stated that many of these problems are the direct result of the debt-finance, trade and economic system that is operated by the oligarchs. Now the oligarchs present themselves as the solvers of the problems of their own making. A global &#8220;pincer movement&#8221; of agitation from &#8220;below&#8221; (the &#8220;Left&#8221;)  and manipulation from &#8220;above&#8221; (the &#8220;oligarchs&#8221;) dialectically operates to shift the center of mass political gravity towards an acceptance of, if not support for, a World State to end the crises that have been created by our self-appointed &#8220;world saviors.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/fareedzakaria-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/fareedzakaria-2.jpg" alt="" /></a>Several months ago, Time editor Fareed Zakaria, a transplant who fled India, told Terri Gross of National Public Radio that America will add a healthy 138 million people via immigration in the next 39 years.  He neglected to mention that his own country at 1.2 billion and headed for 1.6 billion—suffers untold human misery, poverty, environmental destruction, carbon footprint, ecological footprint, filthy rivers, toxic drinking water and a litany of problems that are irreversible and unsolvable.  I know because I have traveled through India.  There is no “Indian Dream” for nine-tenths of its population.  The squalor, filth and misery of India takes a sane person’s breath away.  And, there is no hope of conditions improving, ever.</p>
<p>I wrote Terri Gross with facts, figures and graphs to show that we cannot sustain another 138 million at the level of water, energy and resource usage of an average American. I invited her to interview my work and that of 35 other top PH.D. experts in the field of environment and overpopulation.  She declined.</p>
<p>The fact remains:  NPR and the Main Stream Media avoid, evade and suppress any discussion on America’s human overpopulation.  Men like Zakaria, are known as “innumerates” or credentialed individuals that lack the ability to perform simple math.  Dr. Albert Bartlett, <a href="http://www.albartlett.com/" target="_blank">www.albartlett.com</a>,  of the University of Colorado, defines “innumeracy” as the mathematical equivalent of illiteracy.</p>
<p>Recently, Zakaria spouted more innumeracy when he said, “US demographics are strikingly healthy. We&#8217;ll be the only rich country to increase its population over the next 30 years.”  We are following the miserable population path already tread by India and China as the third fastest growing nation on the planet.  But not by our own hand as American women have averaged 2.03 children since 1970.   As the world adds 1 billion every 12 years on its way to adding 3 billion in 40 years, we will see growing and unending starvation, wars for resources and a line of desperate world citizens knocking on our door to enter.  They are already busting down the door on the Mexican border.  But Zakaria welcomes unlimited growth!</p>
<p>To which one of the most brilliant men in history said, &#8220;Unlimited population growth cannot be sustained; you cannot sustain growth in the rates of consumption of resources. No species can overrun the carrying capacity of a finite land mass. This Law cannot be repealed and is not negotiable.” Dr. Albert Bartlett</p>
<p>I wrote Zakaria a similar letter with facts, graphs and figures.  He did not respond, because “innumerates” cannot respond to facts or in most cases, reality.  In fact, such persons gain tremendous audiences because few want to face the facts or the future with any realistic understanding of what will happen.  It’s the proverbial Cassandra Syndrome.</p>
<p>Once again, others like to shoot the messenger.  I am a messenger and a very exceptional one.</p>
<p>One reader from Michigan wrote, “And yet if you try to inform most people of <em>any </em>of those alarming statistics, you are almost guaranteed a &#8220;shoot the messenger&#8221; reception. Question the growing number of food stamp and/or welfare recipients and you&#8217;re called selfish, a bigot and &#8220;not willing to share.&#8221; Mention the high rate of illiteracy and it quickly becomes a racist thing. And if one <em>dares </em>suggest even a <em>slowing </em>of the influx of immigrants, well . . . you may just get reminded that somewhere in your family history your ancestors came from somewhere else, and that maybe you should just go live in <em>that </em>country!  I know that more than one person has said that to me (as if the conditions were the same in 1900 as they are today &#8212; not to mention that in those pre-welfare days someone coming to America either engaged in productive work or they didn&#8217;t survive!)   Keep up the good work. There are readers like myself, that are not afraid to pass this on, despite the listener almost always letting us know they&#8217;d rather not hear about it.”</p>
<p>One reader told me that he is optimistic as to adding 100 million.  Sorry, optimism won’t cut it when we don’t have the water, energy, food and resources to sustain another 100 million on our ecologically devastated planet.</p>
<p>Therefore, once again, I offer some of the finest minds for you to ponder on what it means to keep wrecking the planet, this civilization and no critical thought as to the impact of human overpopulation.</p>
<p>SERIOUS REALITIES FACING OUR CIVILIZATION IN 21<sup>ST</sup> CENTURY</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The raging monster upon the land is population growth. In its presence, sustainability is but a fragile theoretical construct.  To say, as many do, that the difficulties of nations are not due to people, but to poor ideology and land-use management is sophistic.”  Harvard scholar and biologist E.O. Wilson</em></p>
<p><em>“Most Western elites continue urging the wealthy West not to stem the migrant tide [that adds 80 million net gain annually to the planet], but to absorb our global brothers and sisters until their horrid ordeal has been endured and shared by all—ten billion humans packed onto an ecologically devastated planet.” Dr. Otis Graham, Unguarded Gates</em></p>
<p>Lester Brown, author of <em>Plan B 4.0 Saving Civilization</em> said, “The world has set in motion environmental trends that are threatening civilization itself.  We are crossing environmental thresholds and violating deadlines set by nature. Nature is the timekeeper, but we cannot see the clock.”</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Somehow, we have come to think the whole purpose of the economy is to grow, yet growth is not a goal or purpose. The pursuit of endless growth is suicidal.&#8221;  David Suzuki</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Growth for the sake of yet more growth is a bankrupt and eventually lethal idea. CASSE is the David fighting the Goliath of endless expansion, and we know how that one turned out.&#8221; ~ David Orr</p>
<p>The green revolution was instigated as a result of the efforts of <a title="" href="http://www.normanborlaug.org/" target="_blank">Norman Borlaug</a>, who, <a title="" href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1970/borlaug-lecture.html" target="_blank">while accepting the Nobel peace prize in 1970</a>, said: &#8220;The green revolution has won a temporary success in man&#8217;s war against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space. If fully implemented, the revolution can provide sufficient food for sustenance during the next three decades. But the frightening power of human reproduction must also be curbed; otherwise the success of the green revolution will be ephemeral only.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The cheap oil age created an artificial bubble of plentitude for a period not much longer than a human lifetime&#8230;.so I hazard to assert that as oil ceases to be cheap and the world reserves move toward depletion, we will be left with an enormous population&#8230;that the ecology of the earth will not support. The journey back toward non-oil population homeostasis will not be pretty.  We will discover the hard way that population hyper growth was simply a side-effect of the oil age.  It was a condition, not a problem with a solution. That is what happened and we are stuck with it.&#8221;  James Howard Kunstler, The Long Emergency </em></p>
<p><em>“We must alert and organize the world&#8217;s people to pressure world leaders to take specific steps to solve the two root causes of our environmental crises &#8211; exploding population growth and wasteful consumption of irreplaceable resources. Over-consumption and overpopulation underlie every environmental problem we face today.”   Jacques-Yves Cousteau, Oceanographer</em></p>
<p>“Upwards of two hundred species.. mostly of the large, slow-breeding variety.. are becoming extinct here every day because more and more of the earth&#8217;s carrying capacity is systematically being converted into human carrying capacity. These species are being burnt out, starved out, and squeezed out of existence.. thanks to technologies that most people, I&#8217;m afraid, think of as technologies of peace. I hope it will not be too long before the technologies that support our population explosion begin to be perceived as no less hazardous to the future of life on this planet than the endless production of radioactive wastes.” <a title="Daniel Quinn quotes" href="http://www.woopidoo.com/business_quotes/authors/daniel-quinn/index.htm" target="_blank">Daniel Quinn</a> - <a href="http://www.woopidoo.com/business_quotes/nature-quotes.htm" target="_blank">Nature</a> - <a href="http://www.woopidoo.com/business_quotes/life-quotes.htm" target="_blank">Life</a> - <a href="http://www.woopidoo.com/business_quotes/people-quotes.htm" target="_blank">People</a> - <a href="http://www.woopidoo.com/business_quotes/world-quotes.htm" target="_blank">World</a> - <a href="http://www.woopidoo.com/business_quotes/technology-quotes.htm" target="_blank">Technology</a> - <a href="http://www.woopidoo.com/business_quotes/peace-quotes.htm" target="_blank">Peace</a> - <a href="http://www.woopidoo.com/business_quotes/environmental-quotes.htm" target="_blank">Environmental</a></p>

<p><em>“As we go from this happy hydrocarbon bubble we have reached now to a renewable energy resource economy, which we do this century, will the “civil” part of civilization survive?  As we both know there is no way that alternative energy sources can supply the amount of per capita energy we enjoy now, much less for the 9 billion expected by 2050. And energy is what keeps this game going. We are involved in a Faustian bargain—selling our economic souls for the luxurious life of the moment, but sooner or later the price has to be paid.”  Walter Youngquist, energy  </em></p>
<p><em>“The U.S. will set a record in the rate of rise—and fall of an empire.  Between wide open borders and fall of the dollar and growing population against a declining resource base, the US will be defeated from within. Mobs will rule the streets in the nation that is now the third largest in the world and unable to support its population except by taking resources from other countries.”  Arnold Toynbee, historian</em></p>

<p><em>“The ship is already starting to spin out of control.  We may soon lose all chance of grabbing the wheel. Humanity faces a genuinely new situation.  It is not an environmental crisis in the accepted sense. It is a crisis for the entire life-support system for our civilization and our species.”  Fred Pearce, The Last Generation: How Nature Will take Her Revenge for Climate Change</em></p>
<p><em>“At this point, it’s almost certainly too late to manage a transition to sustainability on a global or national scale, even if the political will to attempt it existed, which it clearly does not. Our civilization is in the early stages of the same curve of decline and fall as so many others have followed before it.  What likely lies in wait for us is a long, uneven decline into a new Dark Age  from which, centuries from now, the civilizations of the future will gradually emerge.”</em></p>
<p><em>“We are strong and adaptable animals and can certainly make a new life on the hotter Earth, but there will only be a fraction of inhabitable land left. Soon we face the appalling question of who m can we let aboard the lifeboats?  And who must we reject?  There will be great clamor from climate refugees seeking a safe haven in those few parts where the climate is tolerable and food available. We will need a new set of rules for limiting the population in climate oases.”  James Lovelock, The Vanishing Face of Gaia: A final Warning</em></p>
<p><em>“Imagine we live on a planet. Not our cozy, taken for granted planet, but a planet, a real one, with melting poles and dying forests and a heaving, corrosive sea, raked by winds, strafed by storms, scorched by heat. And inhospitable place.  It needs a new name, Eaarth.”  Bill McKibben, Eaarth: Making a life on a Tough new Planet</em></p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/canada-us-flag-03.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/canada-us-flag-02.jpg" alt="" /></a><em>&#8220;</em><em>The raging monster upon the land is population growth. In its presence, sustainability is but a fragile theoretical construct.  To say, as many do, that the difficulties of nations are not due to people, but to poor ideology and land-use management is sophistic.”  Harvard scholar and biologist Dr. E.O. Wilson</em></p>
<p>For over 30 years, I have written, spoken and stood up to discuss, debate and move the human overpopulation issue forward in America.  I have run into a brick wall constructed by the Catholic Church, the immigration open border lobbies and the Congress of the United States.  It appears that any discussion in America or Canada provides our two countries with the last taboo: no discussion of population for fear of hurting someone else’s feelings.</p>
<p>Whose feelings?  How about the 13.4 million American children living below the poverty line? What about the 100,000 children in Somalia starving to death in the past several months and future months? How about the 18 million humans that starve to death around the planet annually this year and every year?</p>
<p>Why is the population equation the last taboo?  Answer: religion, culture and human denial.  I call upon the Catholic Church, the Protestant Churches, Islam, Buddha, Hindu and all other ancient religions to come to the table to get a handle on relentless human population growth that they all support. Why? Because it’s killing not only millions of human beings; it’s killing millions of fellow creatures and it’s killing our planet.</p>
<p>My long time Canadian friend Tim Murray brings it in this interview. He makes no bones about who is stifling, strangling and suppressing the population equation.</p>
<p>“I am not, by nature, a conspiracy theorist,” said Murray. “As Carl Sagan said, extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. But when people of my ilk consistently see our interviews, op-eds, and lecture invitations abruptly cancelled with feeble excuses given&#8212;if given at all&#8212;then random events suddenly take on a pattern. If we examine it, I think only one conclusion emerges as most plausible. We have been witnessing a slow strangulation of debate about overpopulation. It represents a mass die-off of open discussion of arguably the most important topic of our time by those upon whom our society most depends. Our scientists.”</p>
<p><strong>An Excuse That Just Doesn&#8217;t Add Up</strong></p>
<p>“CAPS (Californians for Population Stabilization) was to have a booth set up at the Vancouver Convention Centre for the science fair held by the American Association for the Advancement of Science this winter,” said Murray. “But guess what. After making the arrangements and paying a fee of $2500, CAPS was told that the deal was off. They could not have a booth at the fair after all. Why? It seems that somebody got to them. Of course, alternative explanations can be entertained. AAAS explained that it is “a non-profit, non-partisan, scientific association, and unfortunately, CAPS does not align with AAAS”. Funny how they took the rent and then made the discovery that CAPS didn’t have as legitimate a right to have a booth as did other organizations less focused on education.</p>
<p>“In response to further inquiry, they added that “We do not provide booth space to organizations with as direct a political and lobbying intent as CAPS on issues that go beyond the interests of our multidisciplinary membership and meeting audience.” Keep in mind, this is the same AAAS whose journal “Science” published Dr. Garrett Hardin’s “Tragedy of the Commons”, an article that attracted more reprint requests than any other paper Science had ever published. Ironically, Dr. Hardin was a founder of CAPS, which AAAS now wants to exclude from its upcoming Vancouver conference.”</p>
<p><strong>Once upon a time overpopulation was considered a legitimate subject for scientific research</strong></p>
<p>“How times have changed,” said Murray. “In 1976, Canada’s then most prestigious and august scientific body, the Science Council of Canada, issued a report (Number 25) that concluded that the country faced a future of severe resource constraints, and that it would be prudent for us to slow the population rate down so as not to exceed 30 million people by century’s end. “Only by keeping population growth low, while at the same time implementing conservation measures on all fronts&#8230;.”, would it be possible to meet future energy demands. And if we did that, they predicted, our population would “stabilize within a generation”. (p. 10, SC Report #25) They added that “annual net immigration of about 50,000 per annum would achieve that growth.” (p. 61)</p>
<p>“Net immigration is now more than six times that number and according to the 2007 census Canada had the fastest growing population in the G8 group, with all major parties wanting to increase the pace! By the beginning of this year, Canada stood at more than 34 million people&#8212;and still growing, as resource shortages loom. No one can say that, as far back as 1976, our top scientists did not try to warn us about the consequences. And the warnings continued.</p>
<p>“In May of 1991 scientists in the “Intelligence Advisory Committee” submitted a report to the Privy Council of Canada that emphasized that “Controlling population growth is crucial to addressing most environmental problems, including global warming.” Six years later, a team of 63 scientists, academics and graduate students led by Dr. Michael Healey of UBC completed a $2.4 million federally-commissioned study of the Fraser Eco-Basin that argued for the development of a Population Plan for the country, as it was apparent that many other farming regions outside Canada’s major urban centers would suffer the same ecological damage that Greater Vancouver’s burgeoning population had inflicted upon the region.”</p>
<p>“Their verdict was that “&#8230;population is central to the problem of sustainability. The government cannot pursue sustainability and at the same time ignore population&#8230;The federal government should adopt a population policy for Canada that is consistent with the principles of sustainability (of which) immigration is one facet.” (Executive Summary, Prospects for Sustainability, p.6)</p>
<p>“In all three cases then, scientists had identified rampant human population growth as very much a legitimate subject of scientific research and felt compelled to recommend curbs to that growth,” said Murray. “Their reports obviously evidenced “lobbying intent”. But now, in 2011, the zeitgeist has shifted to the point that apparently “science” must stand by in silent witness to a mugging of nature, and pretend that this “non-involvement” is something other than what is it&#8212;collusion by default. Scientists have become “silent partners in crime”. Surely Dr. Stuart Hurlbert of SDSU was correct.”</p>
<p>“Suppression of fact and opinion highly relevant to a topic under discussion (eg. Sustainability, population growth , effects of immigration controls) is one of the strongest, most devious , and most irresponsible forms of advocacy possible.” It seems that the editorial gatekeepers of scientific debate are even more reluctant to debate population issues than are politicians. As Professor Fred Meyerson of URI once remarked, “If we were discussing the population and growth and migration of any other species, no one would shy away from it.”</p>
<p><strong>I smell a rat</strong></p>
<p>My long time Canadian friend Tim Murray brings it in this interview. He makes no bones about who is stifling, strangling and suppressing the population equation.</p>
<p>“Here is my suspicion. I smell the odour of two smear organizations in this incident. The Southern Poverty Law Centre (SPLC) and the Center for New Community (CNC), who have made a habit of vetting upcoming events and notifying the hosts that some of the invited guests are &#8220;un-American&#8221;. No doubt, the AAAS have been told that CAPs is &#8220;anti-immigrant&#8221; and &#8220;racist&#8221;. This is what has been happening all over the continent the past few years, and with increasing frequency. Here goes the pattern. Someone in our movement is invited to a convention, or to an interview or to submit an op-ed piece, and suddenly, it is cancelled&#8212;with no reason given.</p>
<p>“It seems that nearly everyone in my circle has had an experience like that&#8212;including me. It is like really hitting it off with someone and then, inexplicably, finding her cold upon meeting her the second time. Or being engaged and being inexplicably left at the altar. If it happens once, or even twice, you can find reasons to dismiss it. But when it becomes the norm, you know the fix is in.</p>
<p>“Environmentalist Frosty Wooldridge had an interview slated for the Thom Hartmann show on NPR. Then suddenly it was cancelled. Environmentalist Leah Durant had an interview scheduled on the Lou Dobbs Show, and suddenly it was cancelled. She had a regular column on Huffington Post, and then it too was suddenly cancelled. No explanation given. But guess who took her place? Carl Pope, the former Executive Director of the Sierra Club, the man who called in the SPLC to a launch a smear campaign against Sierrans who attempted to restore its policy of immigration reduction to the policy books. It seems that all media is been sanitized and cleansed of those elements who would challenge the orthodoxy of &#8220;progressive growthism&#8221;, a perverse hybrid of left-wing social policy and right-wing economics.</p>
<p>“Now I have learned that Madeline Weld, president of the Population Institute of Canada, was invited in late September, 2011, to speak at an event that the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) was organizing for October 31, to mark the occasion of the world population reaching 7 billion. The event was to last 3 hours and include a roundtable discussion. But, on October 13, Ms. Weld was advised by CIDA that the entire event had been cancelled due to &#8220;unforeseeable circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>“I have an idea what those unforeseeable circumstances might have been. I suspect that the person who invited Ms. Weld had no idea who she was. But others at CIDA did&#8211;and when they saw (too late) who had been invited to speak at the 7 billion event, they were no doubt horrified. Ms. Weld has challenged the neglect of family planning by CIDA and their flawed development model which ignores population. The powers that be figured it was best to cancel the event.”</p>
<p><strong>The Tentacles of the Smear Network Have A Continental Reach</strong></p>
<p>“There are Canadian groups plugged into the SPLC &#8220;Hatewatch&#8221; network too,” said Murray. “The SPLC sends out frequent bulletins advising supporters where &#8216;racists&#8217; are about to speak. No sooner was the first press conference for the fledging &#8220;Canadians for Immigration Policy Reform&#8221; convened when it was under attack in a Eco-Marxist online magazine for its &#8216;racist&#8217; agenda. If you think this is paranoia then perform a test. Set up a phoney lecture date by someone on the SPLC hate-list and schedule it at a local college or auditorium. Advertise it widely and then wait for the rent-a-crowd rag-bag protesters to show up with placards and blow horns to shout the phantom lecturer down. Make it a cold winter night so we can greet them with fire hoses.”</p>
<p><strong>The New McCarthyism</strong></p>
<p>“We talk about the Sixth Extinction, the fact that we are in the midst of human-caused species loss on a massive scale,” said Murray. “But what we don&#8217;t seem to fathom is that we are also witnessing the Seventh Extinction event&#8212;- a wave of Neo-McCarthyism that is sweeping over the land and causing a mass die-off of discussion about the consequences of runaway immigration-driven population growth in North America. People are being silenced, excluded and dropped. They are losing their columns, their radio shows and their foundation money. And the people who are doing it to them are the same kind of people who wrung their hands when told about how badly treated &#8220;the Hollywood Ten&#8221; were, or how &#8216;un-American&#8217; the House on Un-American Activities was in the 50s. And the Civil Liberties Union has nothing to say about it. Hypocrites.”</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s time to call off our unrequited love affair with the soft green-left</strong></p>
<p>“What can we do about it?” asked Murray. “For starters we can refuse support or cooperation with any who work with the smear network. Stop working with Avaaz.org or Commondreams.org. Stop supporting green NGOs and left wing think tanks that repeat their lies and exclude our voice. Stop pretending that environmentalists, feminists and ‘progressives’ are friends who have lost their way, friends who share our goals but don’t yet understand our perspectives. These people are our enemies. They aim to destroy us. All of them. The McKibbens, the Monbiots, the Brunes, the Hartmans. THEY are the sectarians, not us. They are the ones who deserted the IPAT equation, not us. We have tried to work with them but they will not work with us.</p>
<p>“In fact, they work very hard behind the scenes against us&#8212;using their friends at Hampshire College, the SPLC, the CNC and the other smear merchants as their hit men. Their objective is not ours. They are not authentic environmentalists. They want to manage the environment to accommodate endless population growth, but we want to end population growth to accommodate the environment. There can be no fellowship between us. We must end our unrequited love for this so-called environmental &#8216;justice&#8217; coalition. Wake up. This is war.”</p>

			<p><strong>Mother Nature Reveals Her Energy Descent Action Plan&#8230;</strong></p>
<div>
<img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/earth7billion1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p><em>Introduction: It seems that we are under the impression that Mother Nature will award us points for effort. If we do our best and try living less unsustainably, she will forgive us our sins and let us stay in the game because, well, surely she realizes that we are something special&#8212;and should get special treatment. But the truth is, this lady is not for turning. She is one &#8216;hard-ass&#8217;, a referee that cannot be swayed by our histrionics or our pleading. We have got to understand that she has her own schedule, and will not hold up the train for us.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://candobetter.net/node/2662" target="_blank">http://candobetter.net/node/<wbr>2662</wbr></a></p>
<p>We all love Mother Nature because of her beauty, flowers, animals and oceans. We revel in the wilderness. We love our outings in the mountains and by the seashore.</p>
<p>However, for the past 100 years, humans have bashed, cut, slashed, poisoned and destroyed the very ecological systems that gave this planet balance and equanimity.</p>
<p>My Canadian friend Tim Murray put it all into perspective from his cogent viewpoint:</p>
<p>“In the wake an announcement by Transition Towns College in Pennsylvania to hold a workshop about  an &#8220;Energy Descent Action Plan&#8221; that would outline a model for developing strong sustainable communities and strong local economies less reliant on fossil fuels, Mother Nature issued a press release today announcing <strong><em>her</em></strong> Energy Descent Action Plan, which was apparently formulated without public participation,” said Murray. “Despite her declaration that this plan is non-negotiable, she nevertheless invites all stakeholders to present their amendments and counter-proposals at the upcoming General Meeting on Earth day&#8212;if that is what makes people feel good about themselves. But she warned that  she will not be attending the meeting&#8212;- explaining that she is disinterested in our input, doesn&#8217;t give a damn about prospects for survival, and doesn&#8217;t accept our credentials as an exceptional species deserving of special consideration.</p>
<p>“As could be predicated, the announcement was met with incredulity and outrage. Eco-socialists complained that her plan was unnecessary, fascist and Malthusian. There was no need for energy descent because there is enough energy to go around, if only the rich were made to pay and share the wealth. Dump capitalism and this phony energy crisis would be unmasked for what it is, a capitalist plot. Monbiotists argued that the plan was scapegoating the poor for the sins of the rich, and if Canadians stopped hogging energy and learned to freeze in the dark for 5 months a year, then there would be no energy shortage.</p>
<p>“Feminists from Hampshire college joined in on the swarming, claiming that Mother Nature was blaming women for climate change and peak oil, and if only women were &#8220;empowered&#8221;, they wouldn&#8217;t demand so many natural non-renewable resources.  Finally, human rights advocates demanded that the poor, the oppressed, the marginalized, gays, lesbians and transgendered &#8216;people of color&#8217; be exempted from her austerity measures.  Apparently, however, these entreaties and demands fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p>“When she was told that we are trying our best to live more sustainably or rather, less unsustainably, and that we are determined to build resilient, self-sufficient communities, she appeared unmoved. Sounding like Vince Lombardi, she is reported to have said that &#8220;Either you make the cut, or you don&#8217;t. Living within your resource budget is not everything. It is the ONLY thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>“That statement did not go down well with identity groups. &#8220;We won’t accept these cuts!&#8221; they exclaimed. &#8220;Billions of innocent people will die&#8230;. our species may even go extinct.”</p>
<p>“It was at that point that, reportedly, Mother Nature shrugged her shoulders and replied, &#8220;What the hell do I care?&#8221;</p>
<p>“It is rumored that another wave of &#8220;Occupy&#8221; demonstrations will be planned, modeled on the one that took place on Easter Island in the 17th century, when protesters demanded an end to income disparity and debt slavery as a solution to restore old growth forests. (No mention was made of overpopulation however, because it was thought to be a red herring employed by the rich to blame the poor for their own excess, besides,  if women had been empowered, they would have chosen to give birth to fewer loggers.)</p>
<p>“It now appears that we are at an impasse. We have bargained in good faith. We have tried to meet Mother Nature half-way, and moderated our demands in the hope that our sacrifices would provoke reciprocal concessions. But Mother Nature doesn&#8217;t seem to understand that successful negotiations involve give-and-take. We have agreed to cut our consumption of natural capital in half and slow our use of natural resources that cannot be replenished.  But we are obviously dealing with an intractable opponent.</p>
<p>“Nonetheless, we must remain confident that by our resolute solidarity and determination to secure special treatment, we will convince her to give way. Either that, or thanks to human ingenuity, we will come up with alternatives. After all, we always have before, haven&#8217;t we?”</p>
<p>“Now repeat after me, &#8220;The People, United, Will Never be Defeated&#8230;The People, United, Will Never Be Defeated&#8230;..The People, United, Will Never Be Defeated&#8230;..etc. etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Tim Murray talks, we may want to listen to understand Mother Nature better.  If not, her wrath will be our reality.  As to Transition teams, we need to talk about overpopulation, because, in the end with 400 million people in the USA in the blink of an eye, it will be a human mob trying to find food in any way it can.  It won’t be pretty.</p>
