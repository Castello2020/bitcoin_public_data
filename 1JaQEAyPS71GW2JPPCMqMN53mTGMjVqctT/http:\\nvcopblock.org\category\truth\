Sheriff Doug Gillespie expressed his thanks to everyone who has contributed to the success of this difficult process, which has become a model of reform for other police departments around the country.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A &#8220;Slightly&#8221; Different Take on Metro&#8217;s Use of Force Policy</strong></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s kinda like when the <a title="Detroit Lions win/loss history" href="http://www.detroitlions.com/team/history/all-time-results.html">Detroit Lions</a> improved on their winless season in 2008 by winning two games the next year. They certainly got better, but it wasn&#8217;t really anything to get that excited about. Similarly, I recently (subsequent to that celebratory announcement mentioned above) received an account of just how much the LVMPD&#8217;s <a title="Deadly Force: RJ Investigative Report on Police Killings" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/deadly-force">use of force policies</a> have actually changed:</p>
<blockquote style="padding-left: 30px;"><p><tt>"I was at the bus stop on Flamingo just west of Maryland parkway. A car blew through a red light. A cop followed with lights and sirens on. Within 35 seconds, five more cop cars descended on the pulled over and stopped car. Then six cops, guns drawn, one with a fucking shotgun, removed one driver and one passenger, threw them on the hot ground, and cuffed them. Then stand them up. Guns get put away, except for the shotgun. That stayed out and semi pointed the entire time.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Five minutes later, they release the driver, and keep the passenger for TRAFFIC warrants!!!!! They then proceeded to stand around laughing and joking for 20 more minutes...Disgusting. Literally for running a red light, two guys almost died just now. I don't have anymore details than that because I was told to stay back and put away my phone."</tt></p></blockquote>
<p><tt>Overlooking the fact that the cops have <a title="Cop Block: Film the Police" href="http://www.copblock.org/filmthepolice/">no legal ability</a> to overrule a citizen's <a title="When Dealing with Police: Know your Rights – and their Limitations" href="http://nvcopblock.org/175/constitutional-rights-limitations/">First Amendment right</a> to <a title="Official Cop Block Press Passes: Take Your Activism to the Next Level" href="http://nvcopblock.org/323/official-copblock-press-pass-activism/">record anything</a> or anyone within a public space, the rather obvious question is if <a title="Peaceful Occupy Reno Memorial Day March Broken up by “Peace” Officers; 10 Arrested" href="http://nvcopblock.org/134/renomemorialdaymarch/">that level of force really is necessary</a> for a non accident <a title="Cop Block: Houston Traffic Citation Scam" href="http://www.copblock.org/21517/houston-police-officers-used-ticket-scheme-to-earn-overtime-pay/">traffic infraction</a>, in which not only did the driver comply by pulling over, but the cops obviously didn't even consider it <a title="Cop Block: The Right to Travel" href="http://www.copblock.org/40045/right-travel/">much of an offense</a>, based on the fact that they actually allowed him to leave without even <a title="Cop Block: Taxation by Citation" href="http://www.copblock.org/11212/taxation-by-citation/">issuing a citation</a>, when they clearly could have done so. </tt></p>

<p><tt>Having a swarm of <a title="Las Vegas: Beware of Gang Activity in Your Neighborhood!" href="http://nvcopblock.org/119/las-vegas-beware-of-gang-activity-in-your-neighborhood/">heavily armed and easily provoked people</a> unnecessarily confront drivers that haven't shown any signs of resisting during a <a title="Join Nevada Cop Block for the 2nd Annual Chalk the Police Day, Sunday, Sept. 30th" href="http://nvcopblock.org/550/join-nevada-cop-block-for-the-2nd-annual-chalk-the-police-day-sunday-sept-30th/">relatively minor violation</a> certainly does seem like a good way of preventing any more <a title="Cop Block: Understanding, Surviving, and Resisting the Police State" href="http://www.copblock.org/54420/understanding-surviving-and-resisting-the-police-state/">blatant use of force incidents</a>. And BTW, Metro is <a title="No “More Cops” for the LVMPD. They Aren’t Needed and They Aren’t Wanted." href="http://nvcopblock.org/1152/cops-lvmpd-arent-needed-arent-wanted/">so short of personnel</a> that they <a title="LVMPD No longer Responding to All Accidents" href="http://sincitypresents.com/lvmpd-says-its-not-our-problem/">are no longer able to respond</a> to the vast majority of traffic accidents until we <a title="More Cops Does Not Mean More Justice For Las Vegas – Submitted by Adam Sanacore" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1281/morecopsnotmorejustice/">give them more tax money</a>.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Not surprisingly, people in Las Vegas (especially <a title="LVMPD Budget Cuts: Finally, Minorities Benefit from the Recession" href="http://nvcopblock.org/469/lvmpd-budget-shortages-minorities-recession/">those in certain neighborhoods</a>) aren't <a title="Statement of Demands for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Depatment – Submitted by Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/575/statement-of-demands-for-las-vegas-metropolitan-police-depatment-submitted-by-sunet-activist-collective/">exactly shocked</a> by this type of <a title="After Henderson Police Beat Man in Diabetic Shock, NV Residents Pay for It (via submission)" href="http://nvcopblock.org/222/police-beat-man-in-diabetic-shock-and-nevada-city-pays-for-it/">heavy-handed behavior</a> from cops. And, outside of bragging to their "fans" on FaceBook, the LVMPD doesn't seem terribly concerned about changing <a title="Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: The LVMPD’s Killer Reputation" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1030/lvmpd-killer-reputation-fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas/">that perception</a> in any sort of real way:<br />
</tt></p>
<blockquote style="padding-left: 30px;"><p><tt>"It's sad and maybe a statement about how desensitized I am these days to the guns being drawn, but what bothered me the most was them standing around laughing and joking about it afterwards. It seems to me that they are too far removed from the actual reality they are supposed to be "protecting" and have created this pseudo reality in their own collective self. </tt></p>
<p><tt>So is the public as a whole, so blinded by what they are brought up to believe that they really don't see it? Or, are they just willing to "accept" it as part of what happens, as long as it doesn't happen to them?</tt><tt>I have never necessarily been pro-cop, for sure. But, I think I have been among those willing to turn a blind eye to the excessive and overtly hostile tactics they use, until recently. I'm not 100% sure when I changed my outlook, and started really seeing things around me, but I really don't like what I am seeing."</tt></p></blockquote>
<p><tt>But then, a little friendly <a title="Cop Block: Terrorists in Minnesota" href="http://www.copblock.org/46457/terrorists-in-minnesota-latest-fable-of-fbi-employees/">propaganda</a> (which the local Fox affiliate can usually be counted on for) never hurts:<br />
</tt></p>
<blockquote style="padding-left: 30px;"><p><tt>"Oh goody. Just saw a commercial on channel 5. They are reporting on Metro and the crime that is on the rise...Hmmm. I bet it is not a report about abuse at the hands of Metro."</tt></p></blockquote>

<p><tt>However, that does tend to get wiped out by the rather <a title="Interview With Nevada Cop Block Editor, Kelly W. Patterson, RE: “Second Saturday” Graffiti (Audio Clip)" href="http://nvcopblock.org/923/interview-nevada-cop-block-kelly-patterson-second-saturday-graffiti/">well known</a> and <a title="CALL FLOOD: LVMPD Employees Kidnap/Cage Kelly Patterson &amp; Brian Ballentine for Victimless Action" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1067/call-flood-lvmpd-employees-kidnapcage-kelly-patterson-brian-ballentine-for-victimless-action/">all too common</a> cases of <a title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1544/las-vegas-police-retaliation-nevada-cop-block-activism/">retaliation by employees</a> of the <a title="Kelly W.

<blockquote style="padding-left: 30px;"><p><tt>"My friend Chris and I got followed into a parking lot, got out of the car and then got stopped when on foot, walking out of Pizza Hut. For "checking out" the unmarked car the asshole with an ego was driving.<br />
</tt></p>
<p><tt>We both ended up being arrested for "warrants". Even though I had proof mine were already recalled.</tt><tt>I spent from Friday at 6:30 pm to Sunday at 5am in CCDC "waiting" for them to verify I didn't actually have active warrants. Funny thing is that I still had to go to court to stand in front of a judge, who issued me yet another fine, for "court costs" on something I never should have had to go court for in the first place. When I told him I will not pay the fine, he told me I had 30 days to comply or have<br />
another warrant issued."</tt></p></blockquote>
<p><tt><a title="Chalk the Police State" href="http://www.kellywpatterson.com/2013/07/chalk-police-state-july-18th.html">Personally</a>, I just can't understand why Metro or any of the other Las Vegas area police departments would have any sort of <a title="Sheriff Claims Open Carry is Illegal in Reno (Anonymous Submission)" href="http://nvcopblock.org/188/sheriff-claims-open-carry-illegal-reno/">PR problem</a> within the local communities they "<a title="Were Your Father’s Cops Really That Much Better?" href="http://nvcopblock.org/66/were-your-fathers-cops-really-that-much-better/">protect</a> and <a title="“I Want Them to be Afraid Every Time They See the Police”" href="http://nvcopblock.org/64/i-want-them-to-be-afraid-every-time-they-see-the-police/">serve</a>."

<p>Recently, I <a title="Non Partisan Liberty for All with Kelly W.

<p>The main reason I came on was to discuss the <a title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1544/las-vegas-police-retaliation-nevada-cop-block-activism/">article I had just posted</a> about the <a title="LVMPD Retaliation against Nevada Cop Block" href="http://www.copblock.org/53453/lvmpd-retaliation-nevada-copblock/">suspicious events surrounding</a> the hit and run incident I was involved in back in March and the chances that it was an <a title="Why was Danielle Willard Murdered by Utah Police?" href="http://nvcopblock.org/621/why-was-danielle-willard-murdered-by-utah-police/">intentional act</a> committed in <a title="CALL FLOOD: LVMPD Employees Kidnap/Cage Kelly Patterson &amp; Brian Ballentine for Victimless Action" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1067/call-flood-lvmpd-employees-kidnapcage-kelly-patterson-brian-ballentine-for-victimless-action/">retaliation</a> for my <a title="Unite with Nevada Cop Block to Oppose the Cover Up of Stanley Gibson’s Murder by LVMPD" href="http://nvcopblock.org/820/unite-with-nevada-cop-block-to-oppose-the-cover-up-of-stanley-gibsons-murder-by-lvmpd/">opposition to</a> and <a title="Las Vegas Metro Police: Chalk Washes Off, But Injustice Never Will" href="http://nvcopblock.org/895/las-vegas-metro-police-chalk-washes-off-but-injustice-never-will/">exposure of</a> the <a title="Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: The LVMPD’s Killer Reputation" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1030/lvmpd-killer-reputation-fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas/">Las Vegas Metropolitan Department&#8221;s corruption</a> and <a title="A Video Compilation of Las Vegas Police Brutality via Submission" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1287/video-compilation-las-vegas-police-brutality-via-submission/">other crimes</a>, including the <a title="An Open Letter to LVMPD Sheriff Doug Gillespie From Stanley Gibson’s Widow" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1187/open-letter-lvmpd-sheriff-doug-gillespie-stanley-gibson-widow/">murder of Stanley Gibson</a> by <a title="WILL THERE EVER BE JUSTICE? by Rondha Gibson" href="http://nvcopblock.org/830/will-there-ever-be-justice-by-rondha-gibson/">Jesus Arevalo</a> and <a title="After Henderson Police Beat Man in Diabetic Shock, NV Residents Pay for It (via submission)" href="http://nvcopblock.org/222/police-beat-man-in-diabetic-shock-and-nevada-city-pays-for-it/">complete lack of accountability</a> for <a title="“25 Feet of Injustice” by Ballentine of the Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/724/injustice-ballentine-sunset-activist-collective/">abuses committed</a> against <a title="LVMPD Budget Cuts: Finally, Minorities Benefit from the Recession" href="http://nvcopblock.org/469/lvmpd-budget-shortages-minorities-recession/">other local residents</a>. In the process, we discussed my own history and how I originally got involved in activism.</p>

Patterson. NVCopBlock.org editor and longtime local activist, shortly after a hit and run &#8220;accident.&#8221;</p></div>
<h3>A Week of Oddly-Timed &#8220;Coincidences&#8221;</h3>
<p>Two months ago, on March 5th, I was struck by a hit and run driver while walking in downtown Las Vegas. Anybody that&#8217;s familiar with Las Vegas traffic knows that in itself <a title="Las Vegas Pedestrian Dangers" href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2014/mar/02/las-vegas-deadlier-manhattan-saving-pedestrian-liv/">isn&#8217;t exactly an unusual event</a>. However, a string of incredibly oddly timed and interconnected events surrounding my own incident, including another local activist being hit by a car the previous day, have made many within the local activist community wonder if there wasn&#8217;t more to it than just a random car &#8220;accident.&#8221; In fact, some have even classified it as an assassination attempt by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m putting this out there because I feel that it&#8217;s important that people know about it and that there be a public record of it. Because of my injuries, which included a broken back, and the medication that I was taking for those injuries, it did take me a while to get this written, but once again, I think it is important to get this on the record. Not unlike other issues involving Cop Block related activities, when those activities make you a target, visibility and transparency are important not just to ensure accountability but to provide protection for those involved. I really don&#8217;t want to see any other &#8220;coincidences&#8221; happen to any of my <a title="Food Not Bombs Las Vegas" href="http://foodnotbombslasvegas.org/">friends</a> or <a title="OccupyLV" href="http://www.occupylv.org/">other activists </a>within the Las Vegas area and making it public makes it difficult for it to happen again without people connecting the dots.</p>
<p>This account is rather long, but I don&#8217;t think I could have condensed it much more and still shown all the various connections and commonalities between the incidents of the week in question and the past two years that establish the possible motives and &#8220;likely suspects.&#8221; To make things a a little easier to follow, I did create a <a title="Time,ine of Suspiscious Events" href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SunsetTimeline.jpg">timeline</a> that lays out most of those connections in a visual manner, which you can find a thumbnail to below.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">A Timeline of Events Surrounding the Week of Oddly Timed &#8220;Coincidences&#8221;</h4>
<div id="attachment_1572" style="width: 599px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SunsetTimeline.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1572 " src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SunsetTimeline-300x157.jpg" alt="SunsetTimeline 300x157 Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="589" height="172" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Click for a larger, more readable version</p></div>
<p>That week actually consisted of four separate incidents involving members or <a title="Cop Block Press Passes" href="https://www.facebook.com/CopBlockPressPasses">associates</a> of <a title="Nevada Cop Block on FaceBook" href="https://www.facebook.com/NVCopBlock.org">Nevada Cop Block </a>and the <a href="http://SunsetActivistCollective.org" target="_blank">Sunset Activist Collective</a> (a local activist group that several members of <a title="NVCopBlock on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/NVCopBlock">NV Cop Block</a> also belong to). All four of those involved members with ties to anti-police brutality activism, in general, and protests using chalk, in particular. That detail is fairly significant because last August the LVMPD dedicated an entire task force and two months of their time to investigate, charge, and arrest four people (the &#8220;<a title="Sunset 4 OccupyLV" href="http://www.occupylv.org/news/sunset-4-sidewalk-chalk-could-land-four-protestors-jail-year">Sunset 4</a>&#8220;), including myself, for conducting chalk protests relating to <a title="Deadly Force: RJ Investigstive Report on Police Killings" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/deadly-force/always-justified/analysis-many-las-vegas-police-shootings-could-have-been-avoided">police killings in the Las Vegas area</a> and the <a title="Not One" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/image/8833563-3-150007.jpg">lack of accountability</a> for questionable shootings or even several that amount to outright murder.</p>
<div id="attachment_1033" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ChalkThePoliceState-1a.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1033 size-medium" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ChalkThePoliceState-1a-300x167.jpg" alt="ChalkThePoliceState 1a 300x167 Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="300" height="167" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">When the cops in Las Vegas kill people their ONLY &#8220;punishment&#8221; is paid leave.</p></div>
<p>The first of these incidents, on March 4th, 2014, was when one of the &#8220;<a title="Sunset 4 Arrests" href="http://www.copblock.org/36898/call-flood-lvmpd-employees-kidnapcage-kelly-patterson-brian-ballentine-for-victimless-action/">Sunset 4</a>&#8221; arrestees was stopped by Metro police for the rather arbitrary reasoning of supposedly following the car in front of her too closely. To further complicate this incident, just prior to the stop, she had dropped off Ballentine, who had also been among those of us arrested in August of 2013, prior to being stopped.</p>
<p>During the stop, the cops brought up the fact that she had been arrested for chalking and questioned her about her involvement in protesting. At the time, it was considered harassing, but because it was the first incident, it was assumed that they had just noticed the arrest on her record and wasn&#8217;t widely believed to be a targeted act.</p>
<p>Later that same evening, the second incident took place, this time involving local activist Jen Harney,<a title="Chalk Arrests Shame Metro" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/editorials/chalk-talk-protest-shames-police-city"> who had organized a widely publicized protest shortly after the chalking arrests</a>. Similar to my own incident, while crossing the street downtown she was hit by a car. Later, it was determined that the person driving the car she was hit by was not only an ex-cop, but that he currently works for a company that sells weapons and equipment to police departments.</p>
<p>The very next night, on March 5th, I was walking to the bank down Charleston near Las Vegas Blvd. As I (legally) crossed 8th street, a car made a right turn off of Charleston, ran into me, and kept going. During the collision, I suffered a concussion, and as is often the case in accidents, I don&#8217;t remember much beyond the initial point where I saw the car was going to hit me. However, I do have some hazy memories of afterwards and I&#8217;m pretty certain that the car didn&#8217;t make any effort to stop at all.</p>
<p>Finally, the last incident happened two days later on March 7th, 2014, during a &#8220;<a title="First Friday Las Vegas" href="https://www.firstfridaylasvegas.com/">First Friday</a>&#8221; art festival, which is held every month in downtown Las Vegas. Once again, this involved Jen, who was holding the official grand opening for a <a title="Reclaimed Art SupplieZ" href="http://reclaimedart.org/">gallery and art supply store</a> she owns. Late in the evening, a group of uniformed <a title="Las Vegas: Beware of Gang Activity in Your Neighborhood!" href="http://nvcopblock.org/119/las-vegas-beware-of-gang-activity-in-your-neighborhood/">LVMPD</a> officers came to the store.</p>
<p>While there, they displayed no actual interest in shopping, but instead stood together outside looking through the window. Soon after, they approached the doorway and again just stood watching as Jen&#8217;s partner, who is not particularly involved in activism, spoke to some customers. She asked them if there was anything she could help them with and subsequently asked them if they would like her to give them a tour of the gallery. They refused both those requests and continued for some time behaving in a way that made her feel very &#8220;freaked out&#8221; and intimidated, in general.</p>
<h2><strong>The Connections</strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_1585" style="width: 222px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Sunset4WantedPoster.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1585" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Sunset4WantedPoster-212x300.jpg" alt="Sunset4WantedPoster 212x300 Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="212" height="300" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Metro Doesn&#8217;t Like When People Bring Attention to All Those Murders</p></div>
<p>As previously stated, taken separately none these incidents are particularly unusual in Las Vegas. Even those clearly involving intimidation and harassment are pretty standard behavior for Las Vegas area police departments. While it gets a little more suspicious, even the two incidents involving people being run down by cars within less than 24 hours could conceivably just be wild coincidences. However, taken as a whole and factoring in all the common connections paints these as a rather unlikely and most oddly timed set of &#8220;coincidences.&#8221;</p>
<p>First of all, as has already been pointed out, all four of the incidents involved someone with both a connection to anti-police brutality protests and the previous chalking arrests. Secondly, three of those four incidents involved obvious, direct, and provable connections to the police and even to the LVMPD. The lone exception to that is the hit and run against me, in which the driver has not been identified. Thirdly, the limited time frame itself casts suspicion on the randomness of these events. All four of these incidents happened within a 96 hour period and three of the four took place within 24 hours of each other.</p>
<p>Expanding beyond that, there are even more common connections than those simple, obvious ones. On February 14th, 2014 officers from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) <a title="Red Rock Murder video" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/last-moments-man-killed-police-red-rock-captured-video">abused and subsequently murdered</a> a man after cyclists called 911 to report that <a title="Cyclist Who Met D'andre Berghardt Describes him as Friendly" href="http://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/Police-looking-for-information-on-events-leading-up-to-Red-Rock-shooting-246226631.html">he was attempting to flag people down and appeared to be in need of assistance</a> by Red Rock Canyon, just north of Las Vegas, and instead of offering that assistance they sent police to arrest him. In response, members of Nevada Cop Block conducted a protest involving chalking at the headquarters of the Nevada Highway Patrol, which had also had an employee present at the shooting, a few days later.</p>
<p>This particular protest took place roughly two weeks prior to the beginning of the four incidents. In addition, an undercover police officer in an unmarked vehicle was parked across from the NHP headquarters when those taking apart arrived, even though it hadn&#8217;t been announced publicly until about thirty minutes before it was scheduled to take place. This clearly shows that the police are still closely monitoring (the justification for those earlier illegal arrests involved surveillance by the LVMPD, both online and in person, which was detailed in the arrest reports) the activities of NVCB and the Sunset Activist Collective.</p>
<p>Yet another &#8220;coincidence&#8221; is that these incidents all took place during the week prior to the second Saturday of the month. This is significant because &#8220;<a title="Las Vegas Metro Police: Chalk Washes Off, But Injustice Never Will" href="http://nvcopblock.org/895/las-vegas-metro-police-chalk-washes-off-but-injustice-never-will/">Second Saturdays</a>&#8221; are the days on which the <a title="Unite with Nevada Cop Block to Oppose the Cover Up of Stanley Gibson’s Murder by LVMPD" href="http://nvcopblock.org/820/unite-with-nevada-cop-block-to-oppose-the-cover-up-of-stanley-gibsons-murder-by-lvmpd/">regular monthly anti-police brutality protests</a> that lead to the arrests for writing things the cops didn&#8217;t like with chalk are typically held. And a protest at the headquarters of the BLM was in fact scheduled for that day, although it was postponed by one day (see below) due to the four incidents that week.</p>
<h3>The Motives and Previous Examples of Retaliation</h3>
<div id="attachment_1584" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ArrestedForChalking.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1584" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ArrestedForChalking-300x225.jpg" alt="ArrestedForChalking 300x225 Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="300" height="225" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Arrested for drawing with Chalk</p></div>
<p>There are no shortage of clear motives for Las Vegas police to go after members of Nevada Cop Block and the Sunset Activist Collective. Members, both individually and as a group, have a long history of being very active within local grassroots organizations. This has often involved acts of civil disobedience and many times has involved <a title="“Justice for Bubba” Rally for Dog Shot by Las Vegas Police – January 12th at LVMPD Offices" href="http://nvcopblock.org/669/justice-for-bubba-rally-for-dog-shot-by-las-vegas-police-january-12th-at-lvmpd-offices/">direct criticism of the police</a> and <a title="WILL THERE EVER BE JUSTICE? by Rondha Gibson" href="http://nvcopblock.org/830/will-there-ever-be-justice-by-rondha-gibson/">their historical lack of accountability</a>. After the <a title="Stanley Gibson murder" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/disabled-veteran-killed-police-shooting">murder of Stanley Gibson</a> in December of 2011, a regular, sustained pattern of such protests began.</p>
<p>Metro showed their willingness to engage in <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/john-l-smith/jailing-sidewalk-chalk-protesters-constitutes-real-crime">retaliation and intimidation</a> against those who would dare to criticize them and their policies by engaging in a targeted and concerted effort to justify arresting us on trumped up charges. Not only did they attempt to <a href="http://www.mintpressnews.com/las-vegas-sidewalk-chalk-protest-convictions/167102/">characterize drawing with chalk as a graffiti crime</a>, but they also threw in the old standby for &#8220;stacking&#8221; charges of conspiring to commit the non-crime. In order to do so, they created an actual task force dedicated to investigating, charging, and arresting some people writing stuff with chalk. Also, as detailed in the police arrest reports, they engaged in surveillance of those they wished to arrest. This included monitoring of online and social networks (<a title="NVCopBlock on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/NVCopBlock.org">Facebook</a>, <a title="Cop Block Press Passes on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/CopBlockPressID">Twitter</a>, <a title="Nevada Cop Block YouTube Channel" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NevadaCopBlock/videos">Youtube</a>, etc), as well as actual, physical surveillance.</p>
<p>Additionally, even the bogus graffiti charges only allowed for a citation to be issued, which the city had already refused to prosecute, unless the &#8220;damage&#8221; caused amounted to more than $250. So, in order to arrest the &#8220;Sunset 4&#8243; they had to convince the county District Attorney to actually prosecute it and they had to inflate the clean-up costs for <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/50-protest-chalk-charges-las-vegas-police-headquarters">something that throwing a little water on</a> would remove. All of that (once again) was for some people writing stuff with chalk on sidewalks.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, there was a <a title="Chalk Arrests Spark Protest" href="http://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/220067801.html">rather large uproar within the community</a> once the ridiculousness of the charges and the outrageous $1550 clean up bill was made public. This led to the <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/28/charges-dropped-against-chalk-protestors-they-plan/">charges being dropped</a> shortly after and was yet another in a long string of embarrassing incidents that would eventually lead to Clark County Sheriff Gillespie announcing that he would not be running for office again in the upcoming election. The story also got picked up by the AP and received national press coverage, which had the inverse effect of shining a bright light on all the questionable killings and <a title="Confusing a hat for a gun" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/21/nation/la-na-vegas-police-shootings-20130821">complete lack of accountability</a> toward them that we had been protesting in the first place and which they were trying to intimidate us into not bringing attention to.</p>
<div id="attachment_1546" style="width: 572px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Mugshot.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1546 " src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Mugshot.jpg" alt="Mugshot Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="562" height="234" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Political Prisoners</p></div>
<p>Those arrests were, of course, not the first time Metro has abused their authority or retaliated against someone. In a pretty well publicized incident, <a title="Business as Usual for the LVMPD" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/vin-suprynowicz/business-usual-las-vegas-police">they came to the house of the widow of a man they murdered</a> and held her brother hostage until she agreed to allow them to search that house in an (unsuccessful) attempt to find a weapon or some other incriminating evidence to justify their killing of him. Another well known case involves a <a href="http://youtu.be/C_Xe9r0OcfI">woman who was arrested</a> while appearing in Family Court after she reported having been sexually assaulted by one of the marshals working at the court. Similarly, a Las Vegas Constable was recently placed under investigation for <a title="Las Vegas Constable Misconduct" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/las-vegas-police-investigate-constable-employee">stalking and sexually harassing a woman and then shooting her dog</a> when she refused his advances. In yet another case, the <a title="Lawyer Retaliation Arrest" href="http://lasvegas.cbslocal.com/2013/11/15/lawyer-in-bikers-harassment-case-arrested-in-vegas/">lawyer for a group of bikers involved in a harassment lawsuit</a> against Metro was himself arrested.</p>
<p>The LVMPD doesn&#8217;t limit themselves to <a title="LVMPD Retaliation Against Female Filming Brutality During Arrest" href="http://jazoovian.wordpress.com/2013/11/">retaliating against</a> and <a title="LVMPD Harassment on Fremont St." href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/07/joe-downtown-police-crackdown-fremont-east-after-f/">harassing everyday citizens</a>, either. It was recently <a title="LVMPD Retaliation against Steve Sisolak" href="http://www.mynews3.com/content/news/story/Former-Metro-police-captain-alleges-abuse-of-power/WOFnmWnACkWVVhGSiMb31g.cspx">reported by a former Metro captain</a> that the top brass within the LVMPD held an internal meeting to coordinate an effort to dig up dirt on Clark County Commission Chairman Steve Sisolak. The reason that they wanted to do so was in order to discredit him after he opposed a proposal to raise Las Vegas area sales taxes to finance the hiring of additional cops (more on that later).<br />

<h3>Why Would They Come After Me Specifically?</h3>
<div id="attachment_1547" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/PointingAtGillespieYT.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1547 size-medium" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/PointingAtGillespieYT-300x163.jpg" alt="PointingAtGillespieYT 300x163 Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="300" height="163" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pointing at Gillespie</p></div>
<p>This is something that people not familiar with local police issues and the people involved in those issues might ask. One of the more obvious reasons why I would be chosen is a simple matter of convenience. I&#8217;m pretty well known around town for being an avid bike rider and prior to being injured I rode on the average about three hundred miles a week between commuting and recreational group rides. So, if you were going to pick someone to target with a car &#8220;accident,&#8221; picking the guy who&#8217;s on a bike in traffic at least two or three hours every day is a pretty easy choice to make.</p>
<p>However, anyone familiar with <a href="http://www.copblock.org/tag/nevada/">Nevada Cop Block</a>&#8216;s and my own actions over the past two years probably already has a pretty good idea of the deeper reasons. <a title="Nevada Cop Block Founded" href="http://www.copblock.org/16279/a-big-welcome-to-nevada-cop-block/">I founded NVCopBlock.org</a> shortly after <a title="Jesus Arevalo Wanted to Shoot Someone to get Vacation" href="http://www.hendersonpress.com/Articles-News-c-2013-03-05-82852.113122-Former-wife-of-Metro-officer-in-Gibson-killing-gives-disturbing-account-of-shooting-aftermath.html">Officer Jesus Arevalo</a>, who was at that time an employee of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police department, <a title="Stanley L. Gibson Candlight Vigil: June 12, 2012" href="http://nvcopblock.org/155/stanley-l-gibson-candlight-vigil-june-12-2012/">murdered (on video)</a> a friend of mine from high school, named <a title="An Open Letter to LVMPD Sheriff Doug Gillespie From Stanley Gibson’s Widow" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1187/open-letter-lvmpd-sheriff-doug-gillespie-stanley-gibson-widow/">Stanley Gibson</a>, on December 12, 2011. While I had been involved <a href="http://www.kellywpatterson.com/2009/11/las-vegas-wobblies-rally-against.html">for quite a while in activism</a> and <a title="Liberty on Tour Las Vegas Outreach" href="http://libertyontour.com/2010/09/26/las-vegas-outreach/">anti-governmental abuse issues</a> locally and <a title="Chalk the Police Las Vegas" href="http://youtu.be/DTzJuZncars">informally with Cop Block</a> on a national level, this unnecessary, and in my opinion intentional, killing of an innocent, unarmed person that I actually knew made things personal for me.</p>
<p>During <a href="http://sunsetactivistcollective.org/news/chalking-arrests?page=1">the arrest</a> that has already been discussed there were several indicators that things soon became personal toward me for the cops, as well. Not only were several references made to Cop Block or &#8220;that Cop Block guy&#8221; by people during our booking, but I personally overheard a phone call (once again during booking) in which one of the members of the task force they created to arrest us stated &#8220;we got Kelly.&#8221; The fact that he mentioned me by name shows that there was some effort to target me personally. (I was actually rather pleased that they displayed such an awareness of Cop Block, since I think it&#8217;s important that they know we&#8217;re watching them and it showed that we were doing an effective job.)</p>
<p>At the same time, the LVMPD and their lobbyists within the Clark County government were <a title="Don’t Let Coroner’s Inquest Reforms Become Yet Another Victim of Police Intimidation" href="http://nvcopblock.org/644/coroners-inquest-reforms-victim-police-intimidation/">busy undoing reforms</a> that had been created to address the <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/broken-system">glaring lack of accountability</a> that the much criticized Coroner&#8217;s Inquest process allowed. They were, in fact, working to replace those reforms with a new system for reviewing police fatalities that was even worse and less transparent than <a title="ACLU on the Clark County Coroner's Inquests" href="http://www.aclunv.org/clarkco-coronersinquest">the original Coroner&#8217;s Inquests</a> that had failed to <a title="Coroner's Inquest" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/deadly-force/broken-system-shattered-lives/history-clark-county-coroners-inquest-system">hold even one single cop accountable for shooting someone</a>, even when <a title="Metro Cop Shoots Innocent, Unarmed Man in Store" href="http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/las-vegas-cop-shoots-innocent-man-gas-station-video/#axzz2jMUDTev1">that person was unarmed and/or completely innocent</a> in the entire history of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.</p>

<p>Knowing that they intended to ensure <a title="Justice for Stanley Gibson or Just an End-Around Coroner’s Inquest Reforms?" href="http://nvcopblock.org/265/justice-for-stanley-gibson-or-just-an-end-around-coroners-inquest-reforms/">Stanley Gibson</a> would join <a title="Erik Scott Cover Up" href="http://statelymcdanielmanor.wordpress.com/category/erik-scott-case/">Erik Scott</a>, <a title="Trevon Cole Shooting" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/10/raid-of-the-day-trevon-co_n_3254784.html">Trevon Cole</a>, <a title="Orlando Barlow Murder" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/deadly-force/incident/61">Orlando Barlow</a>, and <a title="Henry Rowe Murder" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/deadly-force/always-justified/analysis-many-las-vegas-police-shootings-could-have-been-avoided">Henry Rowe</a> on the <a title="Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: The LVMPD’s Killer Reputation" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1030/lvmpd-killer-reputation-fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas/">long list of people </a><a title="Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: The LVMPD’s Killer Reputation" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1030/lvmpd-killer-reputation-fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas/">blatantly murdered by local police</a> for which no accountability would be afforded <a title="Justice for Stanley Gibson or Just an End-Around Coroner’s Inquest Reforms?" href="http://nvcopblock.org/265/justice-for-stanley-gibson-or-just-an-end-around-coroners-inquest-reforms/">or even pursued</a>. I and others involved with Nevada Cop Block and the Sunset Activist Collective began <a title="Statement of Demands for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Depatment – Submitted by Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/575/statement-of-demands-for-las-vegas-metropolitan-police-depatment-submitted-by-sunet-activist-collective/">staging demonstrations</a> against the <a title="2nd Annual Chalk the Police Day" href="http://youtu.be/5iJbErC-eP4">circumvention of the inquest reforms and police brutality</a>, in general. This soon evolved into regularly scheduled protests held every &#8220;<a title="Second Saturday Interview" href="http://youtu.be/xGVXJjhdclw">Second Saturday</a>&#8221; of the month and came to include <a title="2nd Annual Chalk the Police Day Photos" href="http://youtu.be/Z1lQ6hboBfI">writing with chalk</a> as a <a title="Join Nevada Cop Block for the 2nd Annual Chalk the Police Day, Sunday, Sept. 30th" href="http://nvcopblock.org/550/join-nevada-cop-block-for-the-2nd-annual-chalk-the-police-day-sunday-sept-30th/">regular method</a> of <a title="Statement of Demands for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Depatment – Submitted by Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/575/statement-of-demands-for-las-vegas-metropolitan-police-depatment-submitted-by-sunet-activist-collective/">exposing police abuses</a> and <a title="“25 Feet of Injustice” by Ballentine of the Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/724/injustice-ballentine-sunset-activist-collective/">paying tribute</a> to their victims.</p>
<p>This continued for about nine months before police first tried to intimidate us by <a title="Sunset Three Video" href="http://youtu.be/iAj5MKHlPiY">issuing us citations</a> for writing on sidewalks <a title="Las Vegas Metro Police: Chalk Washes Off, But Injustice Never Will" href="http://nvcopblock.org/895/las-vegas-metro-police-chalk-washes-off-but-injustice-never-will/">with chalk</a> that is specifically sold for the purpose of writing on sidewalks. While those bogus tickets were never even filed, they set into motion the <a title="Chalk the Police State" href="http://www.kellywpatterson.com/2013/07/chalk-police-state-july-18th.html">chain of events</a> that led to the even more <a title="CALL FLOOD: LVMPD Employees Kidnap/Cage Kelly Patterson &amp; Brian Ballentine for Victimless Action" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1067/call-flood-lvmpd-employees-kidnapcage-kelly-patterson-brian-ballentine-for-victimless-action/">bogus arrests</a> about two months later. That in turn led to even more embarrassment for Metro after public outrage at the ridiculousness of the charges and inflated clean up costs required to justify them led to those charges being quickly dropped.</p>
<p><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/MoreCopsFlyer.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1289" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/MoreCopsFlyer-300x110.jpg" alt="MoreCopsFlyer 300x110 Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="300" height="110" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a>Shortly after that, <a title="Sheriff Gillespie Won't Seek Reelection" href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/26/sheriff-announces-he-wont-seek-third-term/">Sheriff Gillespie announced</a> amidst an almost constant barrage of scandals involving the LVMPD that he would no longer be seeking reelection for the next term, but that he would instead be putting his full efforts into passing the &#8220;<a title="More Cops Tax" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/clark-county-commission-rejects-more-cops-sales-tax-hike">More Cops</a>&#8221; tax, which would increase the county sales taxes in order to fund the hiring of additional cops, and that getting it passed would be considered his legacy as sheriff.</p>
<div id="attachment_1586" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/NoMoreCops.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1586" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/NoMoreCops-150x150.jpg" alt="NoMoreCops 150x150 Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="150" height="150" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lines Out the Door Against &#8220;More Cops&#8221;</p></div>
<p>I don&#8217;t normally get very involved in the formal political process because it usually amounts to nothing more than a waste of time and resources that could be better spent elsewhere. However, partly because of my desire to connect with and support some very cool <a title="Jazoof" href="http://jazoovian.wordpress.com/">people</a> and <a title="Southern Nevada Watchdogs" href="http://www.snwatchdog.org/">groups</a> that had supported me while I was in jail and partly because it presented me with an opportunity to <a title="Kelly More Cops Tax Comments First Hearing" href="http://youtu.be/7wMJ701knAM">bring even more public attention to Metro&#8217;s abuses</a> and <a title="Kelly More Cops Tax Comments 2nd Hearing" href="http://youtu.be/80O6G8Yz3c4">personally confront those enabling and even encouraging it</a>, such as Sheriff Gillespie and Las Vegas Police Union spokesman Chris Collins, <a title="No “More Cops” for the LVMPD. They Aren’t Needed and They Aren’t Wanted." href="http://nvcopblock.org/1152/cops-lvmpd-arent-needed-arent-wanted/">I did become very involved</a> in the fight against the More Cops tax.</p>
<p>Although they kept trying to bring it back hoping to outlast the opposition, ultimately Sheriff Gillespie&#8217;s &#8220;signature proposal&#8221; <a title="More Cops Tax Defeated" href="http://lasvegascitylife.com/sections/news/commissioners-reject-%E2%80%98more-cops%E2%80%99-tax.html">was defeated</a> and in the process those <a title="More Cops Does Not Mean More Justice For Las Vegas – Submitted by Adam Sanacore" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1281/morecopsnotmorejustice/">that spoke out against it</a> were <a title="More Cops Tax public Comments" href="http://youtu.be/276Pb-iI8-Y">able to bring a lot of attention</a> to the <a title="A Video Compilation of Las Vegas Police Brutality via Submission" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1287/video-compilation-las-vegas-police-brutality-via-submission/">waste and abuses</a> within the LVMPD. Our &#8220;graffiti&#8221; arrests and the inflated clean up costs used to justify them, were often cited as examples of both those things. During the first time I spoke against the tax, a picture of me pointing at Sheriff Gillespie and calling his decision to <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/clark-county-commission-rejects-more-cops-sales-tax-hike">refuse a recommendation to fire a cop</a> that had shot an unarmed man because<a href="http://www.fox5vegas.com/story/22916423/man-shot-by-metro-i-was-wounded-for-no-reason"> he thought his hat was a gun</a> disgraceful was posted in the local paper as part of the coverage of the Commission&#8217;s vote against it.</p>
<p>Also by chance, during the public comments for the final vote a few months later, when the tax was ultimately defeated (until the next sheriff gets into office and brings it back), I actually ended up at the podium at the same time Chris Collins, head of the <a href="http://lvppa.com/" target="_blank">Las Vegas Police Protective Association</a> &#8211; the police union &#8211; and was able to reference a previous comment he had made that all the money being wasted and all the people being wrongfully killed &#8220;had nothing to do&#8221; with the More Cops tax.<br />

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<div id="attachment_1601" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/HittingPeopleWCars.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1601" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/HittingPeopleWCars-300x259.jpg" alt="HittingPeopleWCars 300x259 Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="300" height="259" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">That&#8217;d be great Metro</p></div>
<p>Those two instances of public defiance of the two biggest mob bosses in the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, along with the ongoing protests and the public embarrassment caused by their previous attempts to bully us into stopping with citations and arrests, would by themselves be enough motive for someone to want to send a message to members of Nevada Cop Block and the Sunset Activist Collective and to want to personally retaliate and try to intimidate me. As was shown by their plan to discredit Clark County Commission Chairman Sisolak, the defeat of the tax increase that was so coveted was enough to make them want to strike back at those involved in opposing it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, their attempts to have us arrested and jailed for four years (contrary to the single year that was widely reported, we actually potentially faced one year for each of the four charges against us) for drawing on a side walk with something that would take a couple minutes to clean up with some water and a broom (and in fact didn&#8217;t need to be cleaned up unless someone didn&#8217;t want people reading the things written about them), shows their vindictiveness toward us.</p>
<p>Even with all of those reasons to potentially want to go after NVCopBlock in general and myself in particular, it might still seem a bit farfetched that they would actually try to assassinate me with a car. In fact, I hadn&#8217;t been on the look for that sort of tactic and wasn&#8217;t entirely convinced it was the case until after the &#8220;First Friday&#8221; incident, simply because it&#8217;s so incredibly easy for Las Vegas area police to get away with murder that I always figured if they wanted to come after us they would just shoot at us.</p>

<p>However, within the past few days a story surfaced in which a Muslim that the FBI was trying to pressure into becoming an informant actually recorded a federal agent warning him that he &#8220;<a title="&quot;You Might Get Hit by a Car&quot;" href="http://www.democracynow.org/2014/5/2/you_might_get_hit_by_a">might get hit by a car</a>.&#8221; So it&#8217;s not exactly a foreign concept to them.</p>
<p>For decades, law enforcement agencies have employed &#8220;<a title="COINTELPRO 101" href="http://www.freedomarchives.org/Cointelpro.html">COINTELPRO</a>&#8221; type programs to <a href="http://www.pbs.org/hueypnewton/actions/actions_cointelpro.html">intimidate, falsely imprison, disrupt, and even kill</a> activists and members of activist groups. On a federal level, the FBI used such tactics against <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5161811">MLK</a>, <a href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/assassins/malcolm_x/4.html">Malcolm X</a>, <a href="http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/archives/19/fbi.html">Jerry Rubin</a>, <a title="The Murder of Fred Hampton" href="http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-murder-of-fred-hampton/">Fred Hampton</a> (who was drugged by a police informant and then murdered by Chicago police in his sleep), and even <a href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/FBI/Einstein_File_FBIHoover.html">Albert Einstein</a>, based primarily on their political activities and perceived threat to the power that those in authority at the time held. On a side note, while I don&#8217;t actually suspect that the Feds were involved in our incidents, someone self-identifying as a member of military intelligence did show up to our chalking actions at the <a title="Regional Injustice Center" href="http://www.copblock.org/tag/regional-injustice-center/">Regional Injustice Center</a>, one of the actions for which we were later arrested.</p>
<h3>The &#8220;Aftermath&#8221; &#8211; AKA: Did It Work?</h3>
<div id="attachment_1579" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/KellyNVCB.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1579" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/KellyNVCB-300x224.jpg" alt="KellyNVCB 300x224 Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="300" height="224" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Not Gonna Stop</p></div>
<p>If that question is taken literally, then it did almost work. As a result of the hit and run, I suffered a pretty severe concussion, a very badly bruised shoulder, and worst of all a compression fracture to my spine (which necessitated the ridiculously uncomfortable brace in the picture at the top of this article that I had to wear nonstop, including while sleeping, for an entire week). While I&#8217;m much better and at this point it&#8217;s just a matter of some residual pain, I am still recovering from that broken back two months later. I&#8217;m also quite certain that had I been hit even a fraction of a second earlier and been more to the center of the car, rather than toward the right corner, I probably would have been killed rather than injured.</p>
<p>However, since I wasn&#8217;t killed, the answer is an unequivocal no. If anything it makes me more determined to expose them for the criminals they truly are. Not only did they not intimidate me into stopping, the &#8220;Second Saturday&#8221; protest that we had scheduled to bring attention to D&#8217;Andre Berghardt Jr., <a title="Red Rock Murder Nevada BLM" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/grieving-father-fatal-red-rock-police-shooting-i-won-t-accept-it">the person the BLM murdered</a> out by Red Rock Canyon in February, 2014, went on as planned with just a one day postponement to Sunday. Personally, I think that the fact they felt they needed to take me out just shows that what we&#8217;ve been doing is working and getting to them. Plus, I think we owe it to the people that have been murdered in the past without any justice or accountability to keep at it.</p>
<p>Although, both the arrests and the recent incidents have actually caused some of the people who originally came to our demonstrations to back off, the LVMPD and other Las Vegas area police departments can count on the fact that I won&#8217;t be going away anytime soon and nothing they do will ever be enough to intimidate or scare me away from demanding true accountability from them.</p>

<p>In somewhat unrelated news, Nevada Cop Block recently had personalized Cop Block <a title="Nevada Cop Block T-Shirts" href="http://nvcopblock.org/product/nevada-cop-block-t-shirts/">t-shirts</a> created bearing the fancy new NVCopBlock logo, which is awesome (and I&#8217;m not just saying that because I&#8217;m the one that designed it). And of course, as always y<a title="Get Your Cop Block Press Pass" href="http://nvcopblock.org/presspass/">ou can still order</a> the <a title="Official Cop Block Press Passes: Take Your Activism to the Next Level" href="http://nvcopblock.org/323/official-copblock-press-pass-activism/">Official Cop Block Press Passes</a> via the <a title="Official Cop Block Press Passes" href="http://nvcopblock.org/product/official-cop-block-press-passes/">Nevada Cop Block Site shop</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the entire <a title="Shop" href="http://nvcopblock.org/shop/">shop</a> has been updated to accommodate the T-shirts and other new items that will be added soon. One of the new features is the ability to use <a title="Bitcoin" href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin</a> and other &#8220;crypto&#8221; currencies within the shopping cart, if you&#8217;re into alternate currencies. (You can still donate directly to our Bitcoin wallet, also: 1JaQEAyPS71GW2JPPCMqMN53mTGMjVqctT).</p>
<p>Another really cool new feature with the new shop is that it has the option to sign up as an<a title="Affiliate Area" href="http://nvcopblock.org/affiliate-area/"> affiliate</a>. What that means is that you can obtain a personalized referral link to share on your own website, Facebook, Twitter, or pretty much anywhere else you can post links. Whenever someone using that link purchases something on NVCopBlock.org, the person assigned to that link will receive 10% of any amount spent. So you can actually make a little money yourself by referring people.</p>
