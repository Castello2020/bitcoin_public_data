<p>With the amount of <a href="http://www.8newsnow.com/story/4627337/las-vegas-g-sting-political-corruption-trial-begins">corruption</a> that takes place <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/sep/26/fbi-searches-attorneys-office-political-corruption/">on a regular basis</a> within Las Vegas area governments, it can be hard to <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/jane-ann-morrison/did-name-recognition-help-two-primary-candidates">stand out</a>. However, (soon to be former) <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/john-l-smith/constables-office-shows-tvs-gain-citys-loss">Las Vegas Constable John Bonaventura and his deputy constables</a> have actually <a title="Sex, Lies, and Videotape" href="http://clarkcountycriminalcops.wordpress.com/2012/08/05/sex-lies-and-video-tape-las-vegas-constable-john-bonaventuras-has-a-bad-year/">managed</a> to <a href="http://www.knpr.org/son/archive/detail2.cfm?SegmentID=10168">distinguish themselves</a> among the roll call of <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/jane-ann-morrison/politicians-come-and-go-after-serving-corruption-sentences">corrupt officials</a> in Clark County politics and even among the notoriously unaccountable members of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_law_enforcement_agencies_in_Nevada">Las Vegas law enforcement</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.clarkcountynv.gov/depts/constable/las_vegas/Pages/default.aspx">Bonaventura</a>&#8216;s latest scandal involves his cover up of the improper and illegal use of the Lexis Nexis &#8220;<a href="http://www.accurint.com/lawenforcement.html">Accurint</a>&#8221; database service to look up personal information on porn actresses by Deputy Chief Dean Lauer. Currently, Lauer serves as Bonaventura&#8217;s second in command within the troubled Constables office, which is <a href="http://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/200977851.html">scheduled to be eliminated</a> in January after a <a title="The 411 on Vegas 911" href="http://nvprogressive.blogspot.com/2013/03/some-411-on-vegas-911.html">rather extensive string of scandals</a>.</p>
<p>The Accurint service, for which taxpayers are charged $800 a month for the required subscription fees, is intended to be used by law enforcement employees in order to conduct research on personal information during the course of an investigation. Instead, apparently Deputy Chief Lauer used it to conduct research on his favorite porn stars, including Traci Lords, Porche Lynne, Kayla Kleevage, Lisa Sparxxx and Gianna Michaels among the 16 current and former porn actresses accessed via his password and log-in info. A subsequent investigation was unable to find any legitimate law enforcement purpose for those searches.</p>
<p>According to the <a title="Bonaventura ordered shredding of evidence" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/constable-shred-investigation-porn-star-searches">Las Vegas Review Journal</a>, this incriminating information was presented to Constable Bonaventura by an internal affairs investigator:</p>
<blockquote><p>Capt. Hadi Sadjadi, the office’s internal affairs investigator, presented the information at the meeting with Bonaventura, Lauer and other senior officers. On a recording of the meeting obtained by the Review-Journal, Bonaventura wasn’t interested in knowing anything at all about the unauthorized searches done between March and December 2012.</p>
<p>“I need you to pull out all that stuff you got on Dean for running the Accurint stuff because, you know, I believe in my heart that he didn’t do it because he’s addicted to porno or something like that,” Bonaventura is heard saying. “I know somebody mentioned it was 3 in the morning or whatever. &#8230; I don’t know. I don’t even want to know. I don’t want to f—-ing know. Whatever you got, I want you to bring it in here and put it in the pile.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It soon went beyond a simple lack of interest in investigating a clearly improper use of department resources into an active cover up when Bonaventura ordered Capt Sadjadi to shred all of his evidence and reports relating to the unauthorized Accurint searches:</p>
<div id="attachment_1906" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/BonaventuraShred.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1906" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/BonaventuraShred-300x200.jpg" alt="BonaventuraShred 300x200 LV Constable John Bonaventura Ordered Cover Up of Illegal Data Searches" width="300" height="200" title="LV Constable John Bonaventura Ordered Cover Up of Illegal Data Searches" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Instead of investigating the improper use of the police records database, Bonaventura ordered the evidence shredded.</p></div>
<blockquote><p>On the recording, Sadjadi is heard responding to Bonaventura’s opening comment by asking that chairs in the office be rearranged so staffers could face each other and have a “friendly debate.”</p>
<p>“We’re not having a debate, Hadi,” Bonaventura responded. “We’re not having a debate. &#8230;”</p>
<p>“But what I want you guys to do is I’m going to leave the room,” Bonaventura said. “There’s all this stuff here. There’s a shredder right there. Take your own crap and put it in the f—-ing shredder, OK? And when I come back, I want every­body to shake hands and that’s it.”</p>
<p>Bonaventura’s orders were followed and his men shredded the records, current and former employees familiar with the matter told the newspaper.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently, Bonaventura&#8217;s motive for sweeping this incident under the rug was, at least in some part, based on a desire to avoid yet another scandal for the Las Vegas Constable&#8217;s office, which at that point had already been abolished in a vote (which Bonaventura was <a title="Boneventura hopes court will overturn vote to abolish constables" href="http://youtu.be/ezjcyMsKTdQ">attempting to contest</a> at the time) by County Commissioners, as a result of a seemingly endless string of embarrassing and public scandals.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bonaventura expressed concern for the future of his job, and for those of his staff.</p>
<p>“I don’t want no more of this infighting b—-s—-,” Bonaventura said. “We got too much at stake here. All of our jobs are on the line. Don’t you guys realize every one of our jobs are on the line?”</p>
<p>Bonaventura’s orders were followed and his men shredded the records, current and former employees familiar with the matter told the newspaper.</p>
<p>In the year since the shredding, Lauer has remained on the job. He is one of about two dozen sworn law enforcement officers in the Constable’s Office, which handles evictions and serves court papers.</p></blockquote>
<p>This cover up shows the typical bias against accountability for law enforcement employees that is so <a href="http://www.copblock.org/45081/excessive-force-case-in-nj-highlights-lack-of-nationwide-police-accountability/">prevalent throughout police departments</a> across the nation and <a href="http://clarkcountycriminalcops.wordpress.com/2012/02/28/clark-counties-new-da-first-decision-is-not-to-charge-cop-caught-kicking-restrained-man-in-the-head/">especially in Las Vegas</a>. Further, it is a somewhat rare public glimpse into the aggressive nature with which police departments in the Las Vegas area don&#8217;t just<a title="Metro Police Use of Force Policy Improvements" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1741/lvmpd-use-of-force-reforms/"> look the other way</a>, but <a title="Justice for Stanley Gibson or Just an End-Around Coroner’s Inquest Reforms?" href="http://nvcopblock.org/265/justice-for-stanley-gibson-or-just-an-end-around-coroners-inquest-reforms/">actively work</a> to <a title="Don’t Let Coroner’s Inquest Reforms Become Yet Another Victim of Police Intimidation" href="http://nvcopblock.org/644/coroners-inquest-reforms-victim-police-intimidation/">ensure</a> that their officers are never held accountable for their actions.</p>
<p>The improper use of the Accurint database by Lauer is, in and of itself, <a title="Illegal use of police databases" href="http://www.aclu-md.org/uploaded_files/0000/0227/013_-_aacpd_dpscs_contract.pdf">an illegal act</a> that <a href="http://www.copwatch.org/databaseabuse.html">numerous cops across the country</a> have been disciplined for committing (although usually not criminally, because laws obviously don&#8217;t apply to them). It has also become a <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/gp_solo_magazine_home/gp_solo_magazine_index/benefits_challenge.html">huge potential</a> <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/nov/28/metro-admits-release-data/">invasion of the right to privacy</a> with the <a href="http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&amp;article_id=319&amp;issue_id=62004">ever increasing trend toward the collection of personal information</a> by police and governmental agencies spurred by and justified with the September 11th terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>In fact, according to &#8220;<a title="Improper use of police databases" href="http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&amp;article_id=319&amp;issue_id=62004">Police Chief Magazine&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Historically, officers have accessed police databases for myriad improper purposes, ranging from running the vehicle registration of an attractive motorist to seeking names and information in connection with a private investigation business.</p></blockquote>
<p>Questions should be asked about why there <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/174052311.html">aren&#8217;t better safeguards</a> preventing <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/hundreds-of-police-members-caught-abusing-confidential-information-on-operational-intelligence-database/story-fnat79vb-1226637132957">unauthorized use</a> of <a href="http://www.aclu-md.org/press_room/72">such a system</a>. That is especially true in light of the growing number of reports of <a href="http://www.copblock.org/10954/deputy-accused-of-sexually-exploiting-children-gets-paid-vacation/">sexual misconduct</a> among <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/08/house-arrest-sexual-intimidations-_n_3727114.html">police officers</a>, including those <a title="Las Vegas Court Marshall sexually assaults woman then has her arrested" href="http://youtu.be/C_Xe9r0OcfI">working in Las Vegas</a>. Furthermore, the potential for the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-05-25/ex-cop-accused-of-illegal-use-of-police-database/2729882">compromising of legitimate investigations</a> and Las Vegas&#8217; own rather long history of that <a href="http://www.stevemiller4lasvegas.com/RickRizzolo.html">type of corruption</a> should make this type of cover-up a serious matter, worthy of its own investigation.</p>

<p>Of course, nobody in Las Vegas will be terribly surprised when hearing about <a title="“25 Feet of Injustice” by Ballentine of the Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/724/injustice-ballentine-sunset-activist-collective/">corruption</a> by local politicians, particularly when they are related to law enforcement.

<p>However, even in a city where <a title="Interview With Nevada Cop Block Editor, Kelly W. Patterson, RE: “Second Saturday” Graffiti (Audio Clip)" href="http://nvcopblock.org/923/interview-nevada-cop-block-kelly-patterson-second-saturday-graffiti/">cover ups</a>, <a title="Sunset 4 Arrests" href="http://www.copblock.org/36898/call-flood-lvmpd-employees-kidnapcage-kelly-patterson-brian-ballentine-for-victimless-action/">intimidation</a> of, and <a title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1544/las-vegas-police-retaliation-nevada-cop-block-activism/">retaliation</a> against <a title="Statement of Demands for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Depatment – Submitted by Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/575/statement-of-demands-for-las-vegas-metropolitan-police-depatment-submitted-by-sunet-activist-collective/">critics of the police</a> are commonplace, Bonaventura&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/jan/03/fellow-constables-las-vegas-constables-office-out-/">Constables office has managed</a> to <a title="Constables' history of corruption" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/john-l-smith/constables-office-shows-tvs-gain-citys-loss">outshine all of them</a>. One of the many scandals involved a <a title="LV Constables reality show" href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/dec/30/video-las-vegas-constables-draws-ire-county-offici/">failed bid to sell a reality TV show</a> based on their daily routines. The video, which Bonaventura proudly posted on his <a href="http://johnbonaventura.com/">personal web page</a>, was not as well received by state and county politicians, who oversee the Constables. Among other things, it featured <a title="lawsuit over reality show video costs $415,000 settlement" href="http://youtu.be/cQaHhfa3nPI">deputies</a> employed by the Constable&#8217;s Office <a title="Constable video alarms county commission" href="http://www.8newsnow.com/story/16439294/youtube-video-focused-on-las-vegas-constables">cursing,</a> pulling over and arresting motorists (technically they are allowed to do so, but it <a title="Nevada Constable job description - wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constable#Nevada">isn&#8217;t actually part of their job</a>), and <a href="http://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/136782098.html">acting unprofessional</a>, in general.</p>
<p>In an even worse example of the type of misconduct that has come to signify Las Vegas area police departments, Deputy Luis Rendon is being investigated for sexual harassment and animal cruelty. Rendon is accused of <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/las-vegas-police-investigate-constable-employee">stalking and making unwanted sexual advances toward</a> an 18 year old woman over the course of two months. When those attempts were rebuffed, he responded by shooting her dog. Deputy Rendon was hired in spite of several previous incidents in his background, which has been an <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/criticism-las-vegas-constable-bonaventura-grows">ongoing point</a> of<a title="constable deputy arrested for warrants and drugs" href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/may/30/constables-office-why-didnt-warrant-deputys-arrest/"> criticism</a>, along with questions about whether they are <a title="Constable didn't notice dead body in apartment" href="http://www.fox5vegas.com/story/21390738/constables-office-officer-misses-body-in-apartment?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">being trained properly</a>, during Bonaventura&#8217;s term.</p>
<p>Of course, Constable Bonaventura has his own laundry list of incidents and controversies since taking office in 2010. This includes <a title="LV Constable sexual harassment lawsuit" href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/aug/05/complaints-allege-sexual-harassment-las-vegas-town/">allegations of sexual harassment</a> against a female deputy, demanding that deputies <a title="$415,000 settlement against LV Constables" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/lawsuit-against-las-vegas-constable-bonaventura-settled-415000">lie to County Commissioners</a> about the reality TV video and then retaliating against them when they refused (which resulted in a $415,000 taxpayer funded settlement), <a title="Las Vegas: Beware of Gang Activity in Your Neighborhood!" href="http://nvcopblock.org/119/las-vegas-beware-of-gang-activity-in-your-neighborhood/">turf wars</a> over jurisdiction involving constables from nearby cities (in the process, he <a title="Lawyers deputized by LV Constable to force county to pay their bills" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/las-vegas-constable-deputizes-lawyer-cover-bills-refused-county-commission">deputized two lawyers</a> in order to avoid paying their fees after the County refused the bill), <a title="deputies allege lv constable demanded kickbacks" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/former-employees-allege-las-vegas-constable-required-kickbacks">demanding kickbacks</a> from deputies&#8217; pay, and was himself <a title="LV Constable John Bonaventura DUI arrest" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/las-vegas-constable-disputes-arrest-dui-charge">arrested for DUI</a> while driving home from his office. (<a href="http://clarkcountycriminalcops.wordpress.com/2012/08/31/yes-virginia-there-is-a-santa-clause-honesty-from-the-d-a-s-office-that-virginia-is-a-fairy-tale/">District Attorney Steve Wolfson</a> displayed his own <a title="After Henderson Police Beat Man in Diabetic Shock, NV Residents Pay for It (via submission)" href="http://nvcopblock.org/222/police-beat-man-in-diabetic-shock-and-nevada-city-pays-for-it/">well earned reputation</a> of <a href="http://clarkcountycriminalcops.wordpress.com/the-clark-county-police-officer-hall-of-shame/casey-clarkson-featuring-christopher-tucker/">never holding public officials accountable</a> by <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/feb/22/district-attorney-las-vegas-constable-will-not-fac/">announcing he wouldn&#8217;t prosecute</a> the case.)</p>
<p>Not surprisingly after all of that, Clark County Commissioners voted in March of 2013 <a title="unanimous vote to eliminate LV Constables" href="http://www.fox5vegas.com/story/21722651/clark-county-votes-to-abolish-constables-office">to simply eliminate the Las Vegas Constable&#8217;s office</a>, effective January 2015, once Bonaventura&#8217;s current term runs out. Bonaventura attempted an <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/bonaventura-loses-lawsuit-keep-constable-s-office-around">unsuccessful lawsuit to overturn the vote</a> and then tried to <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/john-l-smith/low-turnout-could-rescue-bonaventura">run for a seat on the County Commission</a> (which <a title="2014 Primary Election Results" href="http://www.silverstateelection.com/county-results/clark.shtml">failed miserably</a> during the primaries and resulted in a <a title="John Bonaventura manipulated donation records" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/vegas-constable-re-writes-campaign-finance-reports">fraud investigation</a> involving <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas-constable-acknowledges-previously-unreported-1000-donation">donations</a> from none other than Dean Lauer, who&#8217;s illegal searches he covered-up). Even the pending dissolution of the LV Constable&#8217;s office hasn&#8217;t actually ended the constant stream of scandals, which for some reason have begun to revolve around secretly taped meetings between Boneventura and other elected officials.</p>
<p>Besides the one involving Bonaventura&#8217;s orders to destroy evidence of the illegal data searches, there are actually two other recorded conversations that have surfaced recently that are at best embarrassing and possibly criminal. In one, which resulted in <a title="LVMPD raids LV Constable's offices" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/metro-executes-search-warrant-las-vegas-constable-s-office">a raid by the LVMPD</a> on the Las Vegas Constable&#8217;s offices, Bonaventura can be heard in a <a title="Bonaventure Collins tape" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/illicit-recording-reveals-budding-bromance-between-damaged-las-vegas-pols">phone conversation</a> with Clark County Commissioner Tom Collins (who has his own <a title="Tom Collins got mad at a tree and shot it" href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/aug/15/north-las-vegas-prosecutor-charges-county-commissi/">extensive history</a> of <a title="Tom Collins insults Utahns at Bundy Ranch" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/water-environment/collins-manages-insult-utahns-comments-bundy-roundup">improprieties</a>) in which Collins insults other commissioners and accuses several of them of being puppets controlled by Commission Chairman Steve Sisolak. In another, Bonaventura himself can be heard <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/politics/government/secret-tape-constable-bonaventura-plots-4m-revenge-fantasy">badmouthing Sisolak and discussing his desire</a> to spend all of the money ($3.9 million) budgeted to the Constable&#8217;s office prior to it&#8217;s closing in retaliation for the vote.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Constables office has a <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/1997/jan/24/constables-office-under-fire-during-ethics-hearing/">long and sordid history</a> of corruption that <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/1996/oct/30/residents-get-chance-to-pick-new-constable/">predates</a> even <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/federal-judge-bars-las-vegas-constable-collecting-100-license-plate-fee-ex-utah-woman">Bonaventura&#8217;s antics</a>. It&#8217;s <a href="http://article.wn.com/view/2014/05/22/Fair_Share_suit_latest_drama_for_Vegas_constables_office/">not likely that the constables will be missed</a> and the fact that they could <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/mar/19/commissioners-vote-abolish-constables-office/">simply be voted out of existence</a> during a time when Las Vegas leads the nation in foreclosures raises questions about <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/feb/19/constables-outlying-areas-see-merit-effort-elimina/">whether they were needed in the first place</a> or if it was just yet another <a title="No “More Cops” for the LVMPD. They Aren’t Needed and They Aren’t Wanted." href="http://nvcopblock.org/1152/cops-lvmpd-arent-needed-arent-wanted/">unnecessary waste of money</a>. However, the biggest potential drawback to the abolition of the Las Vegas Constable&#8217;s office is the fact that the LVMPD will be taking over their duties.</p>
<p>Outside of the slight increase in power and influence that it will give Metro, current Las Vegas Sheriff Doug Gillespie is <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/jane-ann-morrison/though-not-his-idea-gillespie-open-constable-modifications">already using it</a> as an excuse to push for <a title="LVMPD Budget Cuts: Finally, Minorities Benefit from the Recession" href="http://nvcopblock.org/469/lvmpd-budget-shortages-minorities-recession/">more funding</a> and <a title="More Cops Does Not Mean More Justice For Las Vegas – Submitted by Adam Sanacore" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1281/morecopsnotmorejustice/">an increase in personnel</a> within the department. In terms of potential effects on the residents of Las Vegas, having more &#8220;opportunities&#8221; to come into contact with members of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department can be by itself a dangerous proposition. Constable Bonaventura&#8217;s corruption and lack of control over his employees are wasteful and embarrassing, but <a href="http://youtu.be/cygLXPmzMao">an encounter</a> with Las Vegas police <a href="http://www.copblock.org/1004/erik-scotts-death-what-happens-in-the-lvmpd-stays-in-the-lvmpd/">can be deadly</a> and they have <a title="Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: The LVMPD’s Killer Reputation - CopBlock.org" href="http://www.copblock.org/38009/fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas-the-lvmpds-killer-reputation/">absolutely no reason</a> to believe that they won&#8217;t <a href="http://www.copblock.org/36421/five-on-vegas-use-of-force-board-resign-per-police-whitewash-of-shootings/">get away with</a> it, based on Metro&#8217;s history of accountability or more accurately, the lack thereof.</p>

					<div id="attachment_1856" style="width: 388px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ChalkThePoliceState.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1856 size-full" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ChalkThePoliceState.jpg" alt="ChalkThePoliceState Chalk the Police State (July 18th)   Updated List of Cities" width="378" height="228" title="Chalk the Police State (July 18th)   Updated List of Cities" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chalk the Police State Wherever you Are.</p></div>
<p>Tomorrow, July 18th, is the Second Annual &#8220;<a title="Chalk the Police State - CopBlock.org" href="http://www.copblock.org/35638/chalk-the-police-state-july-18th-support-the-sunset-3/-nevada-cop-block-t-shirts-look-good/">Chalk the Police State</a>&#8221; day. <a title="Second Annual Chalk the Police State - CopBlock.org" href="http://www.copblock.org/60204/the-2nd-annual-chalk-the-police-state-day-july-18th/">For the second year</a>, <a title="Shop" href="http://nvcopblock.org/shop/">Nevada Cop Block</a> has called for activists across the country to hold chalk protests in their own cities in solidarity with and to draw attention to the <a title="WILL THERE EVER BE JUSTICE? by Rondha Gibson" href="http://nvcopblock.org/830/will-there-ever-be-justice-by-rondha-gibson/">victims of police brutality</a> and the <a title="Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: The LVMPD’s Killer Reputation" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1030/lvmpd-killer-reputation-fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas/">lack of accountability</a> for crimes and <a title="An Open Letter to LVMPD Sheriff Doug Gillespie From Stanley Gibson’s Widow" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1187/open-letter-lvmpd-sheriff-doug-gillespie-stanley-gibson-widow/">other forms of corruption</a> within <a title="“25 Feet of Injustice” by Ballentine of the Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/724/injustice-ballentine-sunset-activist-collective/">local police departments</a>.</p>
<p>This year in particular is intended to shine a light on the <a title="Metro Police Use of Force Policy Improvements" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1741/lvmpd-use-of-force-reforms/">lack of significant changes</a> in regards to such accountability and the blatant <a title="A Video Compilation of Las Vegas Police Brutality via Submission" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1287/video-compilation-las-vegas-police-brutality-via-submission/">examples of police abuses</a> nationwide. In addition, it will serve as a statement that <a title="Statement of Demands for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Depatment – Submitted by Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/575/statement-of-demands-for-las-vegas-metropolitan-police-depatment-submitted-by-sunet-activist-collective/">we will not tolerate police violence</a> and <a title="Why was Danielle Willard Murdered by Utah Police?" href="http://nvcopblock.org/621/why-was-danielle-willard-murdered-by-utah-police/">murders within our communities</a> and that we are not just going to go away unless some sort of meaningful reforms are instituted and police officers are held responsible for their actions in the same way everyone else would be.</p>
<p>For more on the background and reasons for the &#8220;Chalk the Police State&#8221; event see <a title="Las Vegas Metro Police: Chalk Washes Off, But Injustice Never Will" href="http://nvcopblock.org/895/las-vegas-metro-police-chalk-washes-off-but-injustice-never-will/">here</a>, <a title="Interview With Nevada Cop Block Editor, Kelly W. Patterson, RE: “Second Saturday” Graffiti (Audio Clip)" href="http://nvcopblock.org/923/interview-nevada-cop-block-kelly-patterson-second-saturday-graffiti/">here</a>, <a title="CALL FLOOD: LVMPD Employees Kidnap/Cage Kelly Patterson &amp; Brian Ballentine for Victimless Action" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1067/call-flood-lvmpd-employees-kidnapcage-kelly-patterson-brian-ballentine-for-victimless-action/">here</a>, <a title="Chalk the Police State -EYEAM4ANARCHY" href="http://www.kellywpatterson.com/2013/07/chalk-police-state-july-18th.html">here</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/iAj5MKHlPiY">here</a>, and <a title="Join Us For the 2nd Annual “Chalk the Police State” – July 18th" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1853/2nd-annual-chalk-police-state/">here</a>. Meanwhile, here is an update of the cities that will be participating this year. At this point, we have pretty solid confirmations from 12 cities with a good potential for at least 16 cities nationwide. BTW, even though it&#8217;s obviously very short notice at this point, it&#8217;s still not too late to add YOUR city to this list. One of the many advantages of chalk protests is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/DTzJuZncars">ease of organizing and carrying them out</a>. Basically, all you really need is a few boxes of chalk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Z1lQ6hboBfI">some dedicated friends</a>, and a desire to get the message out that <a title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1544/las-vegas-police-retaliation-nevada-cop-block-activism/">police brutality</a> will not be tolerated in your communities. It&#8217;s quick, easy, and cheap enough for even a small group of motivated people to have a visible impact.</p>

<p>We hope that other cities will join us July 18th to make a statement about police brutality and demand accountability when police victimize people in their communities. Police corruption and misconduct is a nation-wide (international actually) problem and it&#8217;s only getting worse as time goes by. In addition, in spite the prevailing (and false) rationalizations for that increase in violence against citizens, <a title="Police work not dangerous" href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/cop-top-10-dangerous-jobs-country-tanks/">police work is safer than it has ever been</a> and is <a title="Lowest deaths in 54 years" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/30/law-enforcement-deaths/4247393/">becoming safer all the time</a>.</p>
<p>The mistreatment and abuse of you and your neighbors is inexcusable and needs to be stopped. Their record speaks for itself, though. They won&#8217;t regulate themselves or even hold the criminals in their midst accountable, after the fact. You need to <a title="Statement of Demands for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Depatment – Submitted by Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/575/statement-of-demands-for-las-vegas-metropolitan-police-depatment-submitted-by-sunet-activist-collective/">take a stand and demand</a> an end to the police state and its abuses before it&#8217;s too late.</p>
<p>A FaceBook event page has been set up to coordinate all of the different cities planning actions. If you have questions about setting up a chalk protest in your city, potential statements/slogans to write, questions of legality (it&#8217;s completely legal), etc. you can post them there. We would also like to have any local event pages link to that page, so we can keep track of who will be participating and allow people in those cities to coordinate with each other. That event page is located here: <a id="js_14" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/143037152533300/" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/hovercard.php?id=143037152533300">(National) Second Annual Chalk the Police State with the &#8220;Sunset 5&#8243; and in Solidarity with the Victims of Police Brutality, Repression, and Murder</a>.

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Every day brings with it more and more examples of the <a title="Rise of the Warrior Cop - Radley Balko" href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323848804578608040780519904">increasing militarization of the police</a> and <a title="ACLU: Police Militarization Report" href="https://www.aclu.org/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-policing">encroachment of the police state</a> onto everyone&#8217;s lives. At the same time, accountability for police abuses and governmental crimes is becoming harder to find. This month on the 18th of July, the one year anniversary of the original &#8220;<a title="Chalk the Police State - CopBlock.org" href="http://www.copblock.org/35638/chalk-the-police-state-july-18th-support-the-sunset-3/">Chalk the Police State</a>&#8221; event, members of <a title="Get Your Cop Block Press Pass" href="http://nvcopblock.org/presspass/">Nevada Cop Block</a> invite everyone nationwide to send a message that we won&#8217;t accept this within our communities and demand that accountability.</p>
<p>One year ago on July 18, 2013, three members of the <a title="Sunset 4 Arrests" href="http://sunsetactivistcollective.org/news/chalking-arrests?page=1">Sunset Activist Collective</a>, who were at that time being threatened with citations claiming that drawing on a sidewalk with washable sidewalk chalk constitutes graffiti, <a title="Chalk the Police State -EYEAM4ANARCHY" href="http://www.kellywpatterson.com/2013/07/chalk-police-state-july-18th.html">called for a nationwide solidarity rally</a> on the day that was supposed to be our court date. While the city of Las Vegas had enough common sense not to even file those charges, this event (along with a previous &#8220;<a title="Interview With Nevada Cop Block Editor, Kelly W. Patterson, RE: “Second Saturday” Graffiti (Audio Clip)" href="http://nvcopblock.org/923/interview-nevada-cop-block-kelly-patterson-second-saturday-graffiti/">Second Saturday</a>&#8221; chalk protest) ultimately led to the <a title="CALL FLOOD: LVMPD Employees Kidnap/Cage Kelly Patterson &amp; Brian Ballentine for Victimless Action" href="http://www.copblock.org/36898/call-flood-lvmpd-employees-kidnapcage-kelly-patterson-brian-ballentine-for-victimless-action/">arrest of three members of the NVCopBlock</a> and the filing of <a title="Chalk Arrests -LVRJ" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/sidewalk-chalk-could-land-four-protesters-jail-year">ridiculous charges</a> of <a title="Chalk Arrests Shame Metro" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/john-l-smith/jailing-sidewalk-chalk-protesters-constitutes-real-crime">writing graffiti</a> (with chalk marketed, sold, and primarily used to write on sidewalks) and <a title="Chalk Arrests Spark Protest" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/editorials/chalk-talk-protest-shames-police-city">&#8220;conspiring&#8221; to write graffiti</a> against another two members (AKA the &#8220;Sunset 5&#8243;) by Steve Wolfson, the county district attorney.</p>
<p><em>*Note, if you&#8217;ve been following along at home, you may have noticed the number of people involved has changed from the original &#8220;Sunset 3&#8243; to the current &#8220;Sunset 5.&#8221; The &#8220;Sunset 3&#8243; consisted of the original three individuals that were cited in June of 2013. After<a title="CALL FLOOD: LVMPD Employees Kidnap/Cage Kelly Patterson &amp; Brian Ballentine for Victimless Action" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1067/call-flood-lvmpd-employees-kidnapcage-kelly-patterson-brian-ballentine-for-victimless-action/"> the arrests</a> the &#8220;Sunset 4&#8243; was used because one of the arrestees was a minor at the time. The &#8220;Sunset 5&#8243; consists of the three original members and two additional members that were charged after July 18th&#8217;s action last year.*</em></p>
<p>Of course, those <a title="Four Years for Chalk Protests - LVRJ" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/sidewalk-chalk-could-land-four-protesters-jail-year">ridiculous charges</a>, which amounted to nothing more than a <a title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1544/las-vegas-police-retaliation-nevada-cop-block-activism/">vindictive attempt</a> to <a title="Somebody Saw Unpopular Opinions, Somebody Said Something" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1818/saw-unpopular-opinion-said-something/">intimidate people</a> who were bringing attention to the <a title="Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: The LVMPD’s Killer Reputation" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1030/lvmpd-killer-reputation-fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas/">murderous record of Las Vegas area police</a> and <a title="An Open Letter to LVMPD Sheriff Doug Gillespie From Stanley Gibson’s Widow" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1187/open-letter-lvmpd-sheriff-doug-gillespie-stanley-gibson-widow/">nonexistent history of accountability for those crimes</a>, were <a title="Chalking Charges Dropped - LV Sun" href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/28/charges-dropped-against-chalk-protestors-they-plan/">dropped shortly afterwards</a>. In the process, the actions of the bullies within the LVMPD, who had pushed for the charges, backfired in a big way. Realistically, all they accomplished was to draw way more attention to the <a title="A Video Compilation of Las Vegas Police Brutality via Submission" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1287/video-compilation-las-vegas-police-brutality-via-submission/">issues of police brutality</a> we were protesting than <a title="Unite with Nevada Cop Block to Oppose the Cover Up of Stanley Gibson’s Murder by LVMPD" href="http://nvcopblock.org/820/unite-with-nevada-cop-block-to-oppose-the-cover-up-of-stanley-gibsons-murder-by-lvmpd/">those protests</a> had ever actually done. The ridiculously inflated clean up costs that they used to justify those arrests also shined a huge spotlight on the <a title="LVMPD Budget Cuts: Finally, Minorities Benefit from the Recession" href="http://nvcopblock.org/469/lvmpd-budget-shortages-minorities-recession/">wasteful and unnecessary spending habits</a> of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department at a time when they were in the process of <a title="No “More Cops” for the LVMPD. They Aren’t Needed and They Aren’t Wanted." href="http://nvcopblock.org/1152/cops-lvmpd-arent-needed-arent-wanted/">begging Las Vegas area residents for more money</a> by way of a <a title="More Cops Does Not Mean More Justice For Las Vegas – Submitted by Adam Sanacore" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1281/morecopsnotmorejustice/">county sales tax increase</a>.</p>
<h2>A Year Later, What&#8217;s Different? (Spoiler: Not Much)</h2>
<div id="attachment_1591" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ChalkThePoliceState-11a.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1591" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ChalkThePoliceState-11a-300x132.jpg" alt="ChalkThePoliceState 11a 300x132 Join Us For the 2nd Annual Chalk the Police State   July 18th" width="300" height="132" title="Join Us For the 2nd Annual Chalk the Police State   July 18th" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This Offer Still Stands</p></div>
<p>In spite of those original charges being dropped amid a pretty large uproar, those <a title="Las Vegas Metro Police: Chalk Washes Off, But Injustice Never Will" href="http://nvcopblock.org/895/las-vegas-metro-police-chalk-washes-off-but-injustice-never-will/">very real and important issues</a> that we were <a title="“25 Feet of Injustice” by Ballentine of the Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/724/injustice-ballentine-sunset-activist-collective/">protesting</a> in the first place remain. The <a title="After Henderson Police Beat Man in Diabetic Shock, NV Residents Pay for It (via submission)" href="http://nvcopblock.org/222/police-beat-man-in-diabetic-shock-and-nevada-city-pays-for-it/">police brutality</a> and <a title="Stanley L. Gibson Candlight Vigil: June 12, 2012" href="http://nvcopblock.org/155/stanley-l-gibson-candlight-vigil-june-12-2012/">outright murders</a> continue and the <a title="“25 Feet of Injustice” by Ballentine of the Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/724/injustice-ballentine-sunset-activist-collective/">complete lack of accountability</a> for such have not disappeared or even, on <a title="Metro Police Use of Force Policy Improvements" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1741/lvmpd-use-of-force-reforms/">any discernible level, been addressed</a>. If anything, in fact, they&#8217;ve only gotten worse.</p>
<p>Over the course of just the last year, there have been numerous egregious examples of misconduct and abuse by Las Vegas area police. In one instance, <a title="Sheriff Gillespie disregards use of force board recommendation" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/sheriff-declines-fire-officer-involved-november-shooting">Sheriff Gillespie refused the recommendation of the department&#8217;s use of force board</a> to fire <a title="Jacquar Roston" href="http://transparentnevada.com/salaries/2013/las-vegas-metro-police-department/roston-jacquar/">Officer Jacquar Roston,</a> who shot Lawrence Gordon after he mistook his hat for a gun, which would have actually been the first time any LVMPD officer was fired for shooting someone in the entire history of the department. Similarly, <a title="Jason Evans" href="http://transparentnevada.com/salaries/2013/las-vegas-metro-police-department/evans-jason-r/">Officer Jason Evans</a> shot <a title="Metro Cop Shoots Innocent, Unarmed Man in Store" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/officer-involved-shootings/unarmed-man-shot-officer-files-federal-lawsuit-against-department">Antoine Hodges inside a local 7-11 store</a>, in spite of the fact that he was unarmed and backing away from him at the time, after mistaking him for a wanted suspect. In yet another instance, a man attempting to flag passersby down and asking for water <a title="Red Rock Murder Nevada BLM" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/last-moments-man-killed-police-red-rock-captured-video">was accosted and then eventually killed</a> by BLM agents and a Nevada Highway Patrol trooper after concerned <a title="Cyclist Who Met D'andre Berghardt Describes him as Friendly" href="http://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/Police-looking-for-information-on-events-leading-up-to-Red-Rock-shooting-246226631.html">cyclists reported that D&#8217;Andre Berghardt Jr. may have been in need of assistance</a>.</p>
<p>The most blatant and telling example of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department&#8217;s <a title="Don’t Let Coroner’s Inquest Reforms Become Yet Another Victim of Police Intimidation" href="http://nvcopblock.org/644/coroners-inquest-reforms-victim-police-intimidation/">absolute refusal to institute any sort of accountability</a> involves<a href="http://transparentnevada.com/salaries/2011/las-vegas-metro-police-department/arevalo-jesus-l/"> Jesus Arevalo</a>, who <a title="Stanley Gibson murder" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/disabled-veteran-killed-police-shooting">murdered disabled Gulf War vet Stanley Gibson</a> as he sat unarmed within his car, that had been immobilized by police vehicles. Even though Arevalo was technically the first person to be fired (<a title="Always Justified" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/deadly-force/always-justified">or in any other way held accountable</a>) for killing someone on duty, regardless of whether the person killed was unarmed and/or completely innocent, he was actually <a title="Jesus Arevalo's $30,000 Reward for Murder" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/fired-killing-gulf-war-vet-former-metro-cop-jesus-arevalo-still-gets-disability-pay">rewarded for his deadly actions that day</a> with a lifetime of disability payments totaling $30,000 a year, based on the stress he felt because people began calling him a murderer after he murdered an innocent, unarmed person (shortly after <a title="Jesus Arevalo Wanted to Shoot Someone to get Vacation" href="http://www.hendersonpress.com/Articles-News-c-2013-03-05-82852.113122-Former-wife-of-Metro-officer-in-Gibson-killing-gives-disturbing-account-of-shooting-aftermath.html">stating that he wanted to kill someone</a> in order to get payed time off).</p>
<p>It couldn&#8217;t be <a title="Kelly W. Patterson of NVCopBlock On Non Partisan Liberty For All" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1641/non-partisan-liberty-interview/">much more obvious</a> that the LVMPD and other Las Vegas area police have no <a title="Justice for Stanley Gibson or Just an End-Around Coroner’s Inquest Reforms?" href="http://nvcopblock.org/265/justice-for-stanley-gibson-or-just-an-end-around-coroners-inquest-reforms/">real (or even feigned) interest</a> in holding any of their <a title="Las Vegas: Beware of Gang Activity in Your Neighborhood!" href="http://nvcopblock.org/119/las-vegas-beware-of-gang-activity-in-your-neighborhood/">trigger happy gang members</a> accountable for there actions, no matter how questionable or downright blatant those actions might be.</p>

<p>As a result of all those things already mentioned and so much more that there&#8217;s hardly room to list it all, <a title="Join Nevada Cop Block at the Anarchist Cafe (A-Cafe) for “Disarm the Police”" href="http://nvcopblock.org/776/join-nevada-cop-block-at-the-anarchist-cafe-a-cafe-for-disarm-the-police/">Nevada Cop Block</a> will be holding a second annual &#8220;Chalk the Police State&#8221; celebration (which was actually inspired by <a title="2nd Annual Chalk the Police Day" href="http://www.copblock.org/21570/2nd-annual-chalk-the-police/">Cop Block&#8217;s</a> original &#8220;<a title="Join Nevada Cop Block for the 2nd Annual Chalk the Police Day, Sunday, Sept. 30th" href="http://nvcopblock.org/550/join-nevada-cop-block-for-the-2nd-annual-chalk-the-police-day-sunday-sept-30th/">Chalk the Police Day</a>&#8221; and so technically could be considered a fourth annual event.) at the <a title="Regional Injustice Center" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Regional+Justice+Center/@36.166419,-115.145805,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0%3A0x18bbd08220d3e18d?hl=en">Regional Injustice Center</a> in Las Vegas. However, since police brutality and the absence of accountability isn&#8217;t something that&#8217;s <a title="Why was Danielle Willard Murdered by Utah Police?" href="http://nvcopblock.org/621/why-was-danielle-willard-murdered-by-utah-police/">limited to Las Vegas</a>, we&#8217;re calling for groups (and individuals) across the country to <a title="Chalk the Police State - Free Keene" href="http://freekeene.com/2013/07/19/yes-thomas-mullins-reputation-is-important/">join us in a little summer time arts and crafts</a> display.</p>
<p>Ideally, we would prefer if you chose somewhere symbolic of the police state, such as a courthouse, local government building such as a city hall, or police station to chalk some messages. However, it&#8217;s obviously up to you to choose the most appropriate place to do so in your own city. Please join us and help seek justice in a peaceful, public manner against those who have made injustice a part of their job description and have some fun at the same time.</p>
<p>One of the many advantages of <a title="Chalk the Police State - Keene" href="http://freekeene.com/2013/07/19/chalk-the-police-2013/">chalk protests</a> and reasons we found them to be effective is that they are fairly easy to organize and carry out. Contrary to the claims made for the silly charges from last year, it takes very little &#8220;conspiring&#8221; to set up such actions. Also, because those participating can each draw multiple messages without too much difficulty, a relatively <a title="Chalk the Police Las Vegas - Video" href="http://youtu.be/DTzJuZncars">small group</a> can create a large impact within a small amount of time. Basically, all you need is a few boxes of chalk, some dedicated friends, and a <a title="Manchester Chalk Protest" href="http://www.copblock.org/7411/chalk/">desire to seek accountability</a> for local officials and their hired goons.</p>
<h1>Confirmed Cities Thus Far</h1>

<p>Currently we have six cities that have already confirmed that they will be participating. As many as six other cities may also be chalking that day, but we don&#8217;t have solid confirmations from them yet. The cities that definitely will be &#8220;Chalking the Police State&#8221; on July 18th are listed below, along with contact information for people in those cities to use in order to coordinate with them:</p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Las Vegas, NV.</span></h2>
<p>Members of <a title="Nevada Cop Block T-Shirts" href="http://nvcopblock.org/product/nevada-cop-block-t-shirts/">Nevada Cop Block</a> will, of course, be chalking that day. No amount of retaliation or intimidation will be stopping us from seeking accountability from the LVMPD. We&#8217;ll be going back to the Regional Injustice Center, the original location of the inaugural Chalk the Police State Day.</p>

<p>We hope that other cities will join us July 18th to make a statement about police brutality and demand accountability when police victimize people in their communities. Police corruption and misconduct is a nation-wide (international actually) problem and it&#8217;s only getting worse as time goes by. In addition, in spite the prevailing (and false) rationalizations for that increase in violence against citizens, <a title="Police work not dangerous" href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/cop-top-10-dangerous-jobs-country-tanks/">police work is safer than it has ever been</a> and is <a title="Lowest deaths in 54 years" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/30/law-enforcement-deaths/4247393/">becoming safer all the time</a>.</p>
<p>The mistreatment and abuse of you and your neighbors is inexcusable and needs to be stopped. Their record speaks for itself, though. They won&#8217;t regulate themselves or even hold the criminals in their midst accountable, after the fact. You need to <a title="Statement of Demands for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Depatment – Submitted by Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/575/statement-of-demands-for-las-vegas-metropolitan-police-depatment-submitted-by-sunet-activist-collective/">take a stand and demand</a> an end to the police state and its abuses before it&#8217;s too late.</p>
<p>A FaceBook event page has been set up to coordinate all of the different cities planning actions. If you have questions about setting up a chalk protest in your city, potential statements/slogans to write, questions of legality (it&#8217;s completely legal), etc. you can post them there. We would also like to have any local event pages link to that page, so we can keep track of who will be participating and allow people in those cities to coordinate with each other. That event page is located here: <a id="js_14" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/143037152533300/" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/hovercard.php?id=143037152533300">(National) Second Annual Chalk the Police State with the &#8220;Sunset 5&#8243; and in Solidarity with the Victims of Police Brutality, Repression, and Murder</a>.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A &#8220;Slightly&#8221; Different Take on Metro&#8217;s Use of Force Policy</strong></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s kinda like when the <a title="Detroit Lions win/loss history" href="http://www.detroitlions.com/team/history/all-time-results.html">Detroit Lions</a> improved on their winless season in 2008 by winning two games the next year. They certainly got better, but it wasn&#8217;t really anything to get that excited about. Similarly, I recently (subsequent to that celebratory announcement mentioned above) received an account of just how much the LVMPD&#8217;s <a title="Deadly Force: RJ Investigative Report on Police Killings" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/deadly-force">use of force policies</a> have actually changed:</p>
<blockquote style="padding-left: 30px;"><p><tt>"I was at the bus stop on Flamingo just west of Maryland parkway. A car blew through a red light. A cop followed with lights and sirens on. Within 35 seconds, five more cop cars descended on the pulled over and stopped car. Then six cops, guns drawn, one with a fucking shotgun, removed one driver and one passenger, threw them on the hot ground, and cuffed them. Then stand them up. Guns get put away, except for the shotgun. That stayed out and semi pointed the entire time.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Five minutes later, they release the driver, and keep the passenger for TRAFFIC warrants!!!!! They then proceeded to stand around laughing and joking for 20 more minutes...Disgusting. Literally for running a red light, two guys almost died just now. I don't have anymore details than that because I was told to stay back and put away my phone."</tt></p></blockquote>
<p><tt>Overlooking the fact that the cops have <a title="Cop Block: Film the Police" href="http://www.copblock.org/filmthepolice/">no legal ability</a> to overrule a citizen's <a title="When Dealing with Police: Know your Rights – and their Limitations" href="http://nvcopblock.org/175/constitutional-rights-limitations/">First Amendment right</a> to <a title="Official Cop Block Press Passes: Take Your Activism to the Next Level" href="http://nvcopblock.org/323/official-copblock-press-pass-activism/">record anything</a> or anyone within a public space, the rather obvious question is if <a title="Peaceful Occupy Reno Memorial Day March Broken up by “Peace” Officers; 10 Arrested" href="http://nvcopblock.org/134/renomemorialdaymarch/">that level of force really is necessary</a> for a non accident <a title="Cop Block: Houston Traffic Citation Scam" href="http://www.copblock.org/21517/houston-police-officers-used-ticket-scheme-to-earn-overtime-pay/">traffic infraction</a>, in which not only did the driver comply by pulling over, but the cops obviously didn't even consider it <a title="Cop Block: The Right to Travel" href="http://www.copblock.org/40045/right-travel/">much of an offense</a>, based on the fact that they actually allowed him to leave without even <a title="Cop Block: Taxation by Citation" href="http://www.copblock.org/11212/taxation-by-citation/">issuing a citation</a>, when they clearly could have done so. </tt></p>

<p><tt>Not surprisingly, people in Las Vegas (especially <a title="LVMPD Budget Cuts: Finally, Minorities Benefit from the Recession" href="http://nvcopblock.org/469/lvmpd-budget-shortages-minorities-recession/">those in certain neighborhoods</a>) aren't <a title="Statement of Demands for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Depatment – Submitted by Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/575/statement-of-demands-for-las-vegas-metropolitan-police-depatment-submitted-by-sunet-activist-collective/">exactly shocked</a> by this type of <a title="After Henderson Police Beat Man in Diabetic Shock, NV Residents Pay for It (via submission)" href="http://nvcopblock.org/222/police-beat-man-in-diabetic-shock-and-nevada-city-pays-for-it/">heavy-handed behavior</a> from cops. And, outside of bragging to their "fans" on FaceBook, the LVMPD doesn't seem terribly concerned about changing <a title="Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: The LVMPD’s Killer Reputation" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1030/lvmpd-killer-reputation-fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas/">that perception</a> in any sort of real way:<br />
</tt></p>
<blockquote style="padding-left: 30px;"><p><tt>"It's sad and maybe a statement about how desensitized I am these days to the guns being drawn, but what bothered me the most was them standing around laughing and joking about it afterwards. It seems to me that they are too far removed from the actual reality they are supposed to be "protecting" and have created this pseudo reality in their own collective self. </tt></p>
<p><tt>So is the public as a whole, so blinded by what they are brought up to believe that they really don't see it? Or, are they just willing to "accept" it as part of what happens, as long as it doesn't happen to them?</tt><tt>I have never necessarily been pro-cop, for sure. But, I think I have been among those willing to turn a blind eye to the excessive and overtly hostile tactics they use, until recently. I'm not 100% sure when I changed my outlook, and started really seeing things around me, but I really don't like what I am seeing."</tt></p></blockquote>
<p><tt>But then, a little friendly <a title="Cop Block: Terrorists in Minnesota" href="http://www.copblock.org/46457/terrorists-in-minnesota-latest-fable-of-fbi-employees/">propaganda</a> (which the local Fox affiliate can usually be counted on for) never hurts:<br />
</tt></p>
<blockquote style="padding-left: 30px;"><p><tt>"Oh goody. Just saw a commercial on channel 5. They are reporting on Metro and the crime that is on the rise...Hmmm. I bet it is not a report about abuse at the hands of Metro."</tt></p></blockquote>

<p>Recently, I <a title="Non Partisan Liberty for All with Kelly W. Patterson from Nevada Cop Block" href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/nonpartisanlibertyforall/2014/05/13/non-partisan-liberty-for-all-17-with-guest-cop-blocks-kelly-patterson">did an interview</a> for an <a title="Second Saturday Interview" href="http://www.copblock.org/34818/interview-with-nevada-cop-block-editor-kelly-w-patterson-re-second-saturday-graffiti-audio-clip/">internet radio show</a> on <a title="Blog Talk Radio" href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/">Block Talk Radio</a>. The show is entitled &#8220;<a title="Non Partisan Liberty for All" href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/nonpartisanlibertyforall">Non Partisan Liberty for All</a>&#8221; and is hosted by <a title="Non Partisan Liberty for All Facebook Page" href="http://www.facebook.com/nonpartisanlibertyforall">Dave Bourne.</a> While it can be heard everywhere (except <a title="Chinese Internet Censorship" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/17/china-internet-censorship_n_4981389.html">most of China</a> and sometimes <a title="San Francisco BART Cell Signal Blocking" href="http://www.democracynow.org/2011/8/16/bay_area_rapid_transit_accused_of">parts of San Francisco</a>) via the internets, it is based locally here in <a title="Las Vegas: Beware of Gang Activity in Your Neighborhood!" href="http://nvcopblock.org/119/las-vegas-beware-of-gang-activity-in-your-neighborhood/">Las Vegas</a>.</p>
<p>The main reason I came on was to discuss the <a title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1544/las-vegas-police-retaliation-nevada-cop-block-activism/">article I had just posted</a> about the <a title="LVMPD Retaliation against Nevada Cop Block" href="http://www.copblock.org/53453/lvmpd-retaliation-nevada-copblock/">suspicious events surrounding</a> the hit and run incident I was involved in back in March and the chances that it was an <a title="Why was Danielle Willard Murdered by Utah Police?" href="http://nvcopblock.org/621/why-was-danielle-willard-murdered-by-utah-police/">intentional act</a> committed in <a title="CALL FLOOD: LVMPD Employees Kidnap/Cage Kelly Patterson &amp; Brian Ballentine for Victimless Action" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1067/call-flood-lvmpd-employees-kidnapcage-kelly-patterson-brian-ballentine-for-victimless-action/">retaliation</a> for my <a title="Unite with Nevada Cop Block to Oppose the Cover Up of Stanley Gibson’s Murder by LVMPD" href="http://nvcopblock.org/820/unite-with-nevada-cop-block-to-oppose-the-cover-up-of-stanley-gibsons-murder-by-lvmpd/">opposition to</a> and <a title="Las Vegas Metro Police: Chalk Washes Off, But Injustice Never Will" href="http://nvcopblock.org/895/las-vegas-metro-police-chalk-washes-off-but-injustice-never-will/">exposure of</a> the <a title="Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: The LVMPD’s Killer Reputation" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1030/lvmpd-killer-reputation-fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas/">Las Vegas Metropolitan Department&#8221;s corruption</a> and <a title="A Video Compilation of Las Vegas Police Brutality via Submission" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1287/video-compilation-las-vegas-police-brutality-via-submission/">other crimes</a>, including the <a title="An Open Letter to LVMPD Sheriff Doug Gillespie From Stanley Gibson’s Widow" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1187/open-letter-lvmpd-sheriff-doug-gillespie-stanley-gibson-widow/">murder of Stanley Gibson</a> by <a title="WILL THERE EVER BE JUSTICE? by Rondha Gibson" href="http://nvcopblock.org/830/will-there-ever-be-justice-by-rondha-gibson/">Jesus Arevalo</a> and <a title="After Henderson Police Beat Man in Diabetic Shock, NV Residents Pay for It (via submission)" href="http://nvcopblock.org/222/police-beat-man-in-diabetic-shock-and-nevada-city-pays-for-it/">complete lack of accountability</a> for <a title="“25 Feet of Injustice” by Ballentine of the Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/724/injustice-ballentine-sunset-activist-collective/">abuses committed</a> against <a title="LVMPD Budget Cuts: Finally, Minorities Benefit from the Recession" href="http://nvcopblock.org/469/lvmpd-budget-shortages-minorities-recession/">other local residents</a>. In the process, we discussed my own history and how I originally got involved in activism.</p>
<p>Among other things, I spoke about how I evolved from someone who believed in the <a title="The True Nature and Goals of Anarchism" href="http://eyeam4anarchy.hubpages.com/hub/TrueNatureOfAnarchism">basic philosophy of Anarchism</a>, but didn&#8217;t think of it as a <a title="The Not So Wild, Wild West" href="http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=803">viable, real world possibility</a> into someone that <a title="Billy Jack as an Anarchist Metaphor" href="http://www.kellywpatterson.com/2009/11/billy-jack-as-anarchist-metaphor.html">believes in</a> and <a title="History of IWW - Talk by Kelly W.

<h3>A Week of Oddly-Timed &#8220;Coincidences&#8221;</h3>
<p>Two months ago, on March 5th, I was struck by a hit and run driver while walking in downtown Las Vegas. Anybody that&#8217;s familiar with Las Vegas traffic knows that in itself <a title="Las Vegas Pedestrian Dangers" href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2014/mar/02/las-vegas-deadlier-manhattan-saving-pedestrian-liv/">isn&#8217;t exactly an unusual event</a>. However, a string of incredibly oddly timed and interconnected events surrounding my own incident, including another local activist being hit by a car the previous day, have made many within the local activist community wonder if there wasn&#8217;t more to it than just a random car &#8220;accident.&#8221; In fact, some have even classified it as an assassination attempt by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m putting this out there because I feel that it&#8217;s important that people know about it and that there be a public record of it. Because of my injuries, which included a broken back, and the medication that I was taking for those injuries, it did take me a while to get this written, but once again, I think it is important to get this on the record. Not unlike other issues involving Cop Block related activities, when those activities make you a target, visibility and transparency are important not just to ensure accountability but to provide protection for those involved. I really don&#8217;t want to see any other &#8220;coincidences&#8221; happen to any of my <a title="Food Not Bombs Las Vegas" href="http://foodnotbombslasvegas.org/">friends</a> or <a title="OccupyLV" href="http://www.occupylv.org/">other activists </a>within the Las Vegas area and making it public makes it difficult for it to happen again without people connecting the dots.</p>
<p>This account is rather long, but I don&#8217;t think I could have condensed it much more and still shown all the various connections and commonalities between the incidents of the week in question and the past two years that establish the possible motives and &#8220;likely suspects.&#8221; To make things a a little easier to follow, I did create a <a title="Time,ine of Suspiscious Events" href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SunsetTimeline.jpg">timeline</a> that lays out most of those connections in a visual manner, which you can find a thumbnail to below.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">A Timeline of Events Surrounding the Week of Oddly Timed &#8220;Coincidences&#8221;</h4>
<div id="attachment_1572" style="width: 599px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SunsetTimeline.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1572 " src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SunsetTimeline-300x157.jpg" alt="SunsetTimeline 300x157 Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="589" height="172" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Click for a larger, more readable version</p></div>
<p>That week actually consisted of four separate incidents involving members or <a title="Cop Block Press Passes" href="https://www.facebook.com/CopBlockPressPasses">associates</a> of <a title="Nevada Cop Block on FaceBook" href="https://www.facebook.com/NVCopBlock.org">Nevada Cop Block </a>and the <a href="http://sunsetactivistcollective.org" >Sunset Activist Collective</a> (a local activist group that several members of <a title="NVCopBlock on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/NVCopBlock">NV Cop Block</a> also belong to). All four of those involved members with ties to anti-police brutality activism, in general, and protests using chalk, in particular. That detail is fairly significant because last August the LVMPD dedicated an entire task force and two months of their time to investigate, charge, and arrest four people (the &#8220;<a title="Sunset 4 OccupyLV" href="http://www.occupylv.org/news/sunset-4-sidewalk-chalk-could-land-four-protestors-jail-year">Sunset 4</a>&#8220;), including myself, for conducting chalk protests relating to <a title="Deadly Force: RJ Investigstive Report on Police Killings" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/deadly-force/always-justified/analysis-many-las-vegas-police-shootings-could-have-been-avoided">police killings in the Las Vegas area</a> and the <a title="Not One" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/image/8833563-3-150007.jpg">lack of accountability</a> for questionable shootings or even several that amount to outright murder.</p>
<div id="attachment_1033" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ChalkThePoliceState-1a.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1033 size-medium" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ChalkThePoliceState-1a-300x167.jpg" alt="ChalkThePoliceState 1a 300x167 Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="300" height="167" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">When the cops in Las Vegas kill people their ONLY &#8220;punishment&#8221; is paid leave.</p></div>
<p>The first of these incidents, on March 4th, 2014, was when one of the &#8220;<a title="Sunset 4 Arrests" href="http://www.copblock.org/36898/call-flood-lvmpd-employees-kidnapcage-kelly-patterson-brian-ballentine-for-victimless-action/">Sunset 4</a>&#8221; arrestees was stopped by Metro police for the rather arbitrary reasoning of supposedly following the car in front of her too closely. To further complicate this incident, just prior to the stop, she had dropped off Ballentine, who had also been among those of us arrested in August of 2013, prior to being stopped.</p>
<p>During the stop, the cops brought up the fact that she had been arrested for chalking and questioned her about her involvement in protesting. At the time, it was considered harassing, but because it was the first incident, it was assumed that they had just noticed the arrest on her record and wasn&#8217;t widely believed to be a targeted act.</p>
<p>Later that same evening, the second incident took place, this time involving local activist Jen Harney,<a title="Chalk Arrests Shame Metro" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/editorials/chalk-talk-protest-shames-police-city"> who had organized a widely publicized protest shortly after the chalking arrests</a>. Similar to my own incident, while crossing the street downtown she was hit by a car. Later, it was determined that the person driving the car she was hit by was not only an ex-cop, but that he currently works for a company that sells weapons and equipment to police departments.</p>
<p>The very next night, on March 5th, I was walking to the bank down Charleston near Las Vegas Blvd. As I (legally) crossed 8th street, a car made a right turn off of Charleston, ran into me, and kept going. During the collision, I suffered a concussion, and as is often the case in accidents, I don&#8217;t remember much beyond the initial point where I saw the car was going to hit me. However, I do have some hazy memories of afterwards and I&#8217;m pretty certain that the car didn&#8217;t make any effort to stop at all.</p>
<p>Finally, the last incident happened two days later on March 7th, 2014, during a &#8220;<a title="First Friday Las Vegas" href="https://www.firstfridaylasvegas.com/">First Friday</a>&#8221; art festival, which is held every month in downtown Las Vegas. Once again, this involved Jen, who was holding the official grand opening for a <a title="Reclaimed Art SupplieZ" href="http://reclaimedart.org/">gallery and art supply store</a> she owns. Late in the evening, a group of uniformed <a title="Las Vegas: Beware of Gang Activity in Your Neighborhood!" href="http://nvcopblock.org/119/las-vegas-beware-of-gang-activity-in-your-neighborhood/">LVMPD</a> officers came to the store.</p>
<p>While there, they displayed no actual interest in shopping, but instead stood together outside looking through the window. Soon after, they approached the doorway and again just stood watching as Jen&#8217;s partner, who is not particularly involved in activism, spoke to some customers. She asked them if there was anything she could help them with and subsequently asked them if they would like her to give them a tour of the gallery. They refused both those requests and continued for some time behaving in a way that made her feel very &#8220;freaked out&#8221; and intimidated, in general.</p>
<h2><strong>The Connections</strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_1585" style="width: 222px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Sunset4WantedPoster.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1585" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Sunset4WantedPoster-212x300.jpg" alt="Sunset4WantedPoster 212x300 Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="212" height="300" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Metro Doesn&#8217;t Like When People Bring Attention to All Those Murders</p></div>
<p>As previously stated, taken separately none these incidents are particularly unusual in Las Vegas. Even those clearly involving intimidation and harassment are pretty standard behavior for Las Vegas area police departments. While it gets a little more suspicious, even the two incidents involving people being run down by cars within less than 24 hours could conceivably just be wild coincidences. However, taken as a whole and factoring in all the common connections paints these as a rather unlikely and most oddly timed set of &#8220;coincidences.&#8221;</p>
<p>First of all, as has already been pointed out, all four of the incidents involved someone with both a connection to anti-police brutality protests and the previous chalking arrests. Secondly, three of those four incidents involved obvious, direct, and provable connections to the police and even to the LVMPD. The lone exception to that is the hit and run against me, in which the driver has not been identified. Thirdly, the limited time frame itself casts suspicion on the randomness of these events. All four of these incidents happened within a 96 hour period and three of the four took place within 24 hours of each other.</p>
<p>Expanding beyond that, there are even more common connections than those simple, obvious ones. On February 14th, 2014 officers from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) <a title="Red Rock Murder video" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/last-moments-man-killed-police-red-rock-captured-video">abused and subsequently murdered</a> a man after cyclists called 911 to report that <a title="Cyclist Who Met D'andre Berghardt Describes him as Friendly" href="http://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/Police-looking-for-information-on-events-leading-up-to-Red-Rock-shooting-246226631.html">he was attempting to flag people down and appeared to be in need of assistance</a> by Red Rock Canyon, just north of Las Vegas, and instead of offering that assistance they sent police to arrest him. In response, members of Nevada Cop Block conducted a protest involving chalking at the headquarters of the Nevada Highway Patrol, which had also had an employee present at the shooting, a few days later.</p>
<p>This particular protest took place roughly two weeks prior to the beginning of the four incidents. In addition, an undercover police officer in an unmarked vehicle was parked across from the NHP headquarters when those taking apart arrived, even though it hadn&#8217;t been announced publicly until about thirty minutes before it was scheduled to take place. This clearly shows that the police are still closely monitoring (the justification for those earlier illegal arrests involved surveillance by the LVMPD, both online and in person, which was detailed in the arrest reports) the activities of NVCB and the Sunset Activist Collective.</p>
<p>Yet another &#8220;coincidence&#8221; is that these incidents all took place during the week prior to the second Saturday of the month. This is significant because &#8220;<a title="Las Vegas Metro Police: Chalk Washes Off, But Injustice Never Will" href="http://nvcopblock.org/895/las-vegas-metro-police-chalk-washes-off-but-injustice-never-will/">Second Saturdays</a>&#8221; are the days on which the <a title="Unite with Nevada Cop Block to Oppose the Cover Up of Stanley Gibson’s Murder by LVMPD" href="http://nvcopblock.org/820/unite-with-nevada-cop-block-to-oppose-the-cover-up-of-stanley-gibsons-murder-by-lvmpd/">regular monthly anti-police brutality protests</a> that lead to the arrests for writing things the cops didn&#8217;t like with chalk are typically held. And a protest at the headquarters of the BLM was in fact scheduled for that day, although it was postponed by one day (see below) due to the four incidents that week.</p>
<h3>The Motives and Previous Examples of Retaliation</h3>
<div id="attachment_1584" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ArrestedForChalking.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1584" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ArrestedForChalking-300x225.jpg" alt="ArrestedForChalking 300x225 Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="300" height="225" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Arrested for drawing with Chalk</p></div>
<p>There are no shortage of clear motives for Las Vegas police to go after members of Nevada Cop Block and the Sunset Activist Collective. Members, both individually and as a group, have a long history of being very active within local grassroots organizations. This has often involved acts of civil disobedience and many times has involved <a title="“Justice for Bubba” Rally for Dog Shot by Las Vegas Police – January 12th at LVMPD Offices" href="http://nvcopblock.org/669/justice-for-bubba-rally-for-dog-shot-by-las-vegas-police-january-12th-at-lvmpd-offices/">direct criticism of the police</a> and <a title="WILL THERE EVER BE JUSTICE? by Rondha Gibson" href="http://nvcopblock.org/830/will-there-ever-be-justice-by-rondha-gibson/">their historical lack of accountability</a>. After the <a title="Stanley Gibson murder" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/disabled-veteran-killed-police-shooting">murder of Stanley Gibson</a> in December of 2011, a regular, sustained pattern of such protests began.</p>
<p>Metro showed their willingness to engage in <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/john-l-smith/jailing-sidewalk-chalk-protesters-constitutes-real-crime">retaliation and intimidation</a> against those who would dare to criticize them and their policies by engaging in a targeted and concerted effort to justify arresting us on trumped up charges. Not only did they attempt to <a href="http://www.mintpressnews.com/las-vegas-sidewalk-chalk-protest-convictions/167102/">characterize drawing with chalk as a graffiti crime</a>, but they also threw in the old standby for &#8220;stacking&#8221; charges of conspiring to commit the non-crime. In order to do so, they created an actual task force dedicated to investigating, charging, and arresting some people writing stuff with chalk. Also, as detailed in the police arrest reports, they engaged in surveillance of those they wished to arrest. This included monitoring of online and social networks (<a title="NVCopBlock on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/NVCopBlock.org">Facebook</a>, <a title="Cop Block Press Passes on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/CopBlockPressID">Twitter</a>, <a title="Nevada Cop Block YouTube Channel" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NevadaCopBlock/videos">Youtube</a>, etc), as well as actual, physical surveillance.</p>
<p>Additionally, even the bogus graffiti charges only allowed for a citation to be issued, which the city had already refused to prosecute, unless the &#8220;damage&#8221; caused amounted to more than $250. So, in order to arrest the &#8220;Sunset 4&#8243; they had to convince the county District Attorney to actually prosecute it and they had to inflate the clean-up costs for <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/50-protest-chalk-charges-las-vegas-police-headquarters">something that throwing a little water on</a> would remove. All of that (once again) was for some people writing stuff with chalk on sidewalks.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, there was a <a title="Chalk Arrests Spark Protest" href="http://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/220067801.html">rather large uproar within the community</a> once the ridiculousness of the charges and the outrageous $1550 clean up bill was made public. This led to the <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/28/charges-dropped-against-chalk-protestors-they-plan/">charges being dropped</a> shortly after and was yet another in a long string of embarrassing incidents that would eventually lead to Clark County Sheriff Gillespie announcing that he would not be running for office again in the upcoming election. The story also got picked up by the AP and received national press coverage, which had the inverse effect of shining a bright light on all the questionable killings and <a title="Confusing a hat for a gun" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/21/nation/la-na-vegas-police-shootings-20130821">complete lack of accountability</a> toward them that we had been protesting in the first place and which they were trying to intimidate us into not bringing attention to.</p>
<div id="attachment_1546" style="width: 572px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Mugshot.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1546 " src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Mugshot.jpg" alt="Mugshot Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="562" height="234" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Political Prisoners</p></div>
<p>Those arrests were, of course, not the first time Metro has abused their authority or retaliated against someone. In a pretty well publicized incident, <a title="Business as Usual for the LVMPD" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/vin-suprynowicz/business-usual-las-vegas-police">they came to the house of the widow of a man they murdered</a> and held her brother hostage until she agreed to allow them to search that house in an (unsuccessful) attempt to find a weapon or some other incriminating evidence to justify their killing of him. Another well known case involves a <a href="http://youtu.be/C_Xe9r0OcfI">woman who was arrested</a> while appearing in Family Court after she reported having been sexually assaulted by one of the marshals working at the court. Similarly, a Las Vegas Constable was recently placed under investigation for <a title="Las Vegas Constable Misconduct" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/las-vegas-police-investigate-constable-employee">stalking and sexually harassing a woman and then shooting her dog</a> when she refused his advances. In yet another case, the <a title="Lawyer Retaliation Arrest" href="http://lasvegas.cbslocal.com/2013/11/15/lawyer-in-bikers-harassment-case-arrested-in-vegas/">lawyer for a group of bikers involved in a harassment lawsuit</a> against Metro was himself arrested.</p>
<p>The LVMPD doesn&#8217;t limit themselves to <a title="LVMPD Retaliation Against Female Filming Brutality During Arrest" href="http://jazoovian.wordpress.com/2013/11/">retaliating against</a> and <a title="LVMPD Harassment on Fremont St." href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/07/joe-downtown-police-crackdown-fremont-east-after-f/">harassing everyday citizens</a>, either. It was recently <a title="LVMPD Retaliation against Steve Sisolak" href="http://www.mynews3.com/content/news/story/Former-Metro-police-captain-alleges-abuse-of-power/WOFnmWnACkWVVhGSiMb31g.cspx">reported by a former Metro captain</a> that the top brass within the LVMPD held an internal meeting to coordinate an effort to dig up dirt on Clark County Commission Chairman Steve Sisolak. The reason that they wanted to do so was in order to discredit him after he opposed a proposal to raise Las Vegas area sales taxes to finance the hiring of additional cops (more on that later).<br />

<h3>Why Would They Come After Me Specifically?</h3>
<div id="attachment_1547" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/PointingAtGillespieYT.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1547 size-medium" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/PointingAtGillespieYT-300x163.jpg" alt="PointingAtGillespieYT 300x163 Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="300" height="163" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pointing at Gillespie</p></div>
<p>This is something that people not familiar with local police issues and the people involved in those issues might ask. One of the more obvious reasons why I would be chosen is a simple matter of convenience. I&#8217;m pretty well known around town for being an avid bike rider and prior to being injured I rode on the average about three hundred miles a week between commuting and recreational group rides. So, if you were going to pick someone to target with a car &#8220;accident,&#8221; picking the guy who&#8217;s on a bike in traffic at least two or three hours every day is a pretty easy choice to make.</p>
<p>However, anyone familiar with <a href="http://www.copblock.org/tag/nevada/">Nevada Cop Block</a>&#8216;s and my own actions over the past two years probably already has a pretty good idea of the deeper reasons. <a title="Nevada Cop Block Founded" href="http://www.copblock.org/16279/a-big-welcome-to-nevada-cop-block/">I founded NVCopBlock.org</a> shortly after <a title="Jesus Arevalo Wanted to Shoot Someone to get Vacation" href="http://www.hendersonpress.com/Articles-News-c-2013-03-05-82852.113122-Former-wife-of-Metro-officer-in-Gibson-killing-gives-disturbing-account-of-shooting-aftermath.html">Officer Jesus Arevalo</a>, who was at that time an employee of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police department, <a title="Stanley L. Gibson Candlight Vigil: June 12, 2012" href="http://nvcopblock.org/155/stanley-l-gibson-candlight-vigil-june-12-2012/">murdered (on video)</a> a friend of mine from high school, named <a title="An Open Letter to LVMPD Sheriff Doug Gillespie From Stanley Gibson’s Widow" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1187/open-letter-lvmpd-sheriff-doug-gillespie-stanley-gibson-widow/">Stanley Gibson</a>, on December 12, 2011. While I had been involved <a href="http://www.kellywpatterson.com/2009/11/las-vegas-wobblies-rally-against.html">for quite a while in activism</a> and <a title="Liberty on Tour Las Vegas Outreach" href="http://libertyontour.com/2010/09/26/las-vegas-outreach/">anti-governmental abuse issues</a> locally and <a title="Chalk the Police Las Vegas" href="http://youtu.be/DTzJuZncars">informally with Cop Block</a> on a national level, this unnecessary, and in my opinion intentional, killing of an innocent, unarmed person that I actually knew made things personal for me.</p>
<p>During <a href="http://sunsetactivistcollective.org/news/chalking-arrests?page=1">the arrest</a> that has already been discussed there were several indicators that things soon became personal toward me for the cops, as well. Not only were several references made to Cop Block or &#8220;that Cop Block guy&#8221; by people during our booking, but I personally overheard a phone call (once again during booking) in which one of the members of the task force they created to arrest us stated &#8220;we got Kelly.&#8221; The fact that he mentioned me by name shows that there was some effort to target me personally. (I was actually rather pleased that they displayed such an awareness of Cop Block, since I think it&#8217;s important that they know we&#8217;re watching them and it showed that we were doing an effective job.)</p>
<p>At the same time, the LVMPD and their lobbyists within the Clark County government were <a title="Don’t Let Coroner’s Inquest Reforms Become Yet Another Victim of Police Intimidation" href="http://nvcopblock.org/644/coroners-inquest-reforms-victim-police-intimidation/">busy undoing reforms</a> that had been created to address the <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/broken-system">glaring lack of accountability</a> that the much criticized Coroner&#8217;s Inquest process allowed. They were, in fact, working to replace those reforms with a new system for reviewing police fatalities that was even worse and less transparent than <a title="ACLU on the Clark County Coroner's Inquests" href="http://www.aclunv.org/clarkco-coronersinquest">the original Coroner&#8217;s Inquests</a> that had failed to <a title="Coroner's Inquest" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/deadly-force/broken-system-shattered-lives/history-clark-county-coroners-inquest-system">hold even one single cop accountable for shooting someone</a>, even when <a title="Metro Cop Shoots Innocent, Unarmed Man in Store" href="http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/las-vegas-cop-shoots-innocent-man-gas-station-video/#axzz2jMUDTev1">that person was unarmed and/or completely innocent</a> in the entire history of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.</p>

I and others involved with Nevada Cop Block and the Sunset Activist Collective began <a title="Statement of Demands for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Depatment – Submitted by Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/575/statement-of-demands-for-las-vegas-metropolitan-police-depatment-submitted-by-sunet-activist-collective/">staging demonstrations</a> against the <a title="2nd Annual Chalk the Police Day" href="http://youtu.be/5iJbErC-eP4">circumvention of the inquest reforms and police brutality</a>, in general. This soon evolved into regularly scheduled protests held every &#8220;<a title="Second Saturday Interview" href="http://youtu.be/xGVXJjhdclw">Second Saturday</a>&#8221; of the month and came to include <a title="2nd Annual Chalk the Police Day Photos" href="http://youtu.be/Z1lQ6hboBfI">writing with chalk</a> as a <a title="Join Nevada Cop Block for the 2nd Annual Chalk the Police Day, Sunday, Sept. 30th" href="http://nvcopblock.org/550/join-nevada-cop-block-for-the-2nd-annual-chalk-the-police-day-sunday-sept-30th/">regular method</a> of <a title="Statement of Demands for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Depatment – Submitted by Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/575/statement-of-demands-for-las-vegas-metropolitan-police-depatment-submitted-by-sunet-activist-collective/">exposing police abuses</a> and <a title="“25 Feet of Injustice” by Ballentine of the Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/724/injustice-ballentine-sunset-activist-collective/">paying tribute</a> to their victims.</p>
<p>This continued for about nine months before police first tried to intimidate us by <a title="Sunset Three Video" href="http://youtu.be/iAj5MKHlPiY">issuing us citations</a> for writing on sidewalks <a title="Las Vegas Metro Police: Chalk Washes Off, But Injustice Never Will" href="http://nvcopblock.org/895/las-vegas-metro-police-chalk-washes-off-but-injustice-never-will/">with chalk</a> that is specifically sold for the purpose of writing on sidewalks. While those bogus tickets were never even filed, they set into motion the <a title="Chalk the Police State" href="http://www.kellywpatterson.com/2013/07/chalk-police-state-july-18th.html">chain of events</a> that led to the even more <a title="CALL FLOOD: LVMPD Employees Kidnap/Cage Kelly Patterson &amp; Brian Ballentine for Victimless Action" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1067/call-flood-lvmpd-employees-kidnapcage-kelly-patterson-brian-ballentine-for-victimless-action/">bogus arrests</a> about two months later. That in turn led to even more embarrassment for Metro after public outrage at the ridiculousness of the charges and inflated clean up costs required to justify them led to those charges being quickly dropped.</p>

<div id="attachment_1586" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/NoMoreCops.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1586" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/NoMoreCops-150x150.jpg" alt="NoMoreCops 150x150 Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="150" height="150" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lines Out the Door Against &#8220;More Cops&#8221;</p></div>
<p>I don&#8217;t normally get very involved in the formal political process because it usually amounts to nothing more than a waste of time and resources that could be better spent elsewhere. However, partly because of my desire to connect with and support some very cool <a title="Jazoof" href="http://jazoovian.wordpress.com/">people</a> and <a title="Southern Nevada Watchdogs" href="http://www.snwatchdog.org/">groups</a> that had supported me while I was in jail and partly because it presented me with an opportunity to <a title="Kelly More Cops Tax Comments First Hearing" href="http://youtu.be/7wMJ701knAM">bring even more public attention to Metro&#8217;s abuses</a> and <a title="Kelly More Cops Tax Comments 2nd Hearing" href="http://youtu.be/80O6G8Yz3c4">personally confront those enabling and even encouraging it</a>, such as Sheriff Gillespie and Las Vegas Police Union spokesman Chris Collins, <a title="No “More Cops” for the LVMPD. They Aren’t Needed and They Aren’t Wanted." href="http://nvcopblock.org/1152/cops-lvmpd-arent-needed-arent-wanted/">I did become very involved</a> in the fight against the More Cops tax.</p>
<p>Although they kept trying to bring it back hoping to outlast the opposition, ultimately Sheriff Gillespie&#8217;s &#8220;signature proposal&#8221; <a title="More Cops Tax Defeated" href="http://lasvegascitylife.com/sections/news/commissioners-reject-‘more-cops’-tax.html">was defeated</a> and in the process those <a title="More Cops Does Not Mean More Justice For Las Vegas – Submitted by Adam Sanacore" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1281/morecopsnotmorejustice/">that spoke out against it</a> were <a title="More Cops Tax public Comments" href="http://youtu.be/276Pb-iI8-Y">able to bring a lot of attention</a> to the <a title="A Video Compilation of Las Vegas Police Brutality via Submission" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1287/video-compilation-las-vegas-police-brutality-via-submission/">waste and abuses</a> within the LVMPD. Our &#8220;graffiti&#8221; arrests and the inflated clean up costs used to justify them, were often cited as examples of both those things. During the first time I spoke against the tax, a picture of me pointing at Sheriff Gillespie and calling his decision to <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/clark-county-commission-rejects-more-cops-sales-tax-hike">refuse a recommendation to fire a cop</a> that had shot an unarmed man because<a href="http://www.fox5vegas.com/story/22916423/man-shot-by-metro-i-was-wounded-for-no-reason"> he thought his hat was a gun</a> disgraceful was posted in the local paper as part of the coverage of the Commission&#8217;s vote against it.</p>
<p>Also by chance, during the public comments for the final vote a few months later, when the tax was ultimately defeated (until the next sheriff gets into office and brings it back), I actually ended up at the podium at the same time Chris Collins, head of the <a href="http://lvppa.com/" >Las Vegas Police Protective Association</a> &#8211; the police union &#8211; and was able to reference a previous comment he had made that all the money being wasted and all the people being wrongfully killed &#8220;had nothing to do&#8221; with the More Cops tax.<br />

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<div id="attachment_1601" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/HittingPeopleWCars.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1601" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/HittingPeopleWCars-300x259.jpg" alt="HittingPeopleWCars 300x259 Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="300" height="259" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">That&#8217;d be great Metro</p></div>
<p>Those two instances of public defiance of the two biggest mob bosses in the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, along with the ongoing protests and the public embarrassment caused by their previous attempts to bully us into stopping with citations and arrests, would by themselves be enough motive for someone to want to send a message to members of Nevada Cop Block and the Sunset Activist Collective and to want to personally retaliate and try to intimidate me. As was shown by their plan to discredit Clark County Commission Chairman Sisolak, the defeat of the tax increase that was so coveted was enough to make them want to strike back at those involved in opposing it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, their attempts to have us arrested and jailed for four years (contrary to the single year that was widely reported, we actually potentially faced one year for each of the four charges against us) for drawing on a side walk with something that would take a couple minutes to clean up with some water and a broom (and in fact didn&#8217;t need to be cleaned up unless someone didn&#8217;t want people reading the things written about them), shows their vindictiveness toward us.</p>
<p>Even with all of those reasons to potentially want to go after NVCopBlock in general and myself in particular, it might still seem a bit farfetched that they would actually try to assassinate me with a car. In fact, I hadn&#8217;t been on the look for that sort of tactic and wasn&#8217;t entirely convinced it was the case until after the &#8220;First Friday&#8221; incident, simply because it&#8217;s so incredibly easy for Las Vegas area police to get away with murder that I always figured if they wanted to come after us they would just shoot at us.</p>
<div id="attachment_1591" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ChalkThePoliceState-11a.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1591 size-medium" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ChalkThePoliceState-11a-300x132.jpg" alt="ChalkThePoliceState 11a 300x132 Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="300" height="132" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This Offer Still Stands</p></div>
<p>However, within the past few days a story surfaced in which a Muslim that the FBI was trying to pressure into becoming an informant actually recorded a federal agent warning him that he &#8220;<a title="&quot;You Might Get Hit by a Car&quot;" href="http://www.democracynow.org/2014/5/2/you_might_get_hit_by_a">might get hit by a car</a>.&#8221; So it&#8217;s not exactly a foreign concept to them.</p>
<p>For decades, law enforcement agencies have employed &#8220;<a title="COINTELPRO 101" href="http://www.freedomarchives.org/Cointelpro.html">COINTELPRO</a>&#8221; type programs to <a href="http://www.pbs.org/hueypnewton/actions/actions_cointelpro.html">intimidate, falsely imprison, disrupt, and even kill</a> activists and members of activist groups. On a federal level, the FBI used such tactics against <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5161811">MLK</a>, <a href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/assassins/malcolm_x/4.html">Malcolm X</a>, <a href="http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/archives/19/fbi.html">Jerry Rubin</a>, <a title="The Murder of Fred Hampton" href="http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-murder-of-fred-hampton/">Fred Hampton</a> (who was drugged by a police informant and then murdered by Chicago police in his sleep), and even <a href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/FBI/Einstein_File_FBIHoover.html">Albert Einstein</a>, based primarily on their political activities and perceived threat to the power that those in authority at the time held. On a side note, while I don&#8217;t actually suspect that the Feds were involved in our incidents, someone self-identifying as a member of military intelligence did show up to our chalking actions at the <a title="Regional Injustice Center" href="http://www.copblock.org/tag/regional-injustice-center/">Regional Injustice Center</a>, one of the actions for which we were later arrested.</p>
<h3>The &#8220;Aftermath&#8221; &#8211; AKA: Did It Work?</h3>
<div id="attachment_1579" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/KellyNVCB.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1579" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/KellyNVCB-300x224.jpg" alt="KellyNVCB 300x224 Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" width="300" height="224" title="Did Las Vegas Police Retaliate Against Nevada Cop Block for Local Activism?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Not Gonna Stop</p></div>
<p>If that question is taken literally, then it did almost work. As a result of the hit and run, I suffered a pretty severe concussion, a very badly bruised shoulder, and worst of all a compression fracture to my spine (which necessitated the ridiculously uncomfortable brace in the picture at the top of this article that I had to wear nonstop, including while sleeping, for an entire week). While I&#8217;m much better and at this point it&#8217;s just a matter of some residual pain, I am still recovering from that broken back two months later. I&#8217;m also quite certain that had I been hit even a fraction of a second earlier and been more to the center of the car, rather than toward the right corner, I probably would have been killed rather than injured.</p>
<p>However, since I wasn&#8217;t killed, the answer is an unequivocal no. If anything it makes me more determined to expose them for the criminals they truly are. Not only did they not intimidate me into stopping, the &#8220;Second Saturday&#8221; protest that we had scheduled to bring attention to D&#8217;Andre Berghardt Jr., <a title="Red Rock Murder Nevada BLM" href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/grieving-father-fatal-red-rock-police-shooting-i-won-t-accept-it">the person the BLM murdered</a> out by Red Rock Canyon in February, 2014, went on as planned with just a one day postponement to Sunday. Personally, I think that the fact they felt they needed to take me out just shows that what we&#8217;ve been doing is working and getting to them. Plus, I think we owe it to the people that have been murdered in the past without any justice or accountability to keep at it.</p>
<p>Although, both the arrests and the recent incidents have actually caused some of the people who originally came to our demonstrations to back off, the LVMPD and other Las Vegas area police departments can count on the fact that I won&#8217;t be going away anytime soon and nothing they do will ever be enough to intimidate or scare me away from demanding true accountability from them.</p>

					<p>Doug Gillespie,</p>
<div id="attachment_1188" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Chalk-the-Police-014a.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1188" alt="Chalk the Police 014a 300x175 An Open Letter to LVMPD Sheriff Doug Gillespie From Stanley Gibsons Widow" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Chalk-the-Police-014a-300x175.jpg" width="300" height="175" title="An Open Letter to LVMPD Sheriff Doug Gillespie From Stanley Gibsons Widow" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Two years ago today, Stanley Gibson was murdered by Ofc. Jesus Arevalo of the LVMPD</p></div>
<p>I know your name. It&#8217;s a name I will never forget and, along with Jesus Avalero, one of the two names I can NEVER FORGET. My name is Rondha Gibson. I&#8217;m sure you remember my name too, but do you remember what today&#8217;s date represents? For me, it&#8217;s something else I can <a href="http://nvcopblock.org/830/will-there-ever-be-justice-by-rondha-gibson/" title="WILL THERE EVER BE JUSTICE? by Rondha Gibson">never, ever forget</a>.</p>
<p>Today marks two years since <a href="http://nvcopblock.org/155/stanley-l-gibson-candlight-vigil-june-12-2012/" title="Stanley L. Gibson Candlight Vigil: June 12, 2012">Stanley Gibson</a> was <a href="http://nvcopblock.org/265/justice-for-stanley-gibson-or-just-an-end-around-coroners-inquest-reforms/" title="Justice for Stanley Gibson or Just an End-Around Coroner’s Inquest Reforms?">shot and killed</a> while sitting unarmed and incapacitated in his car on December 12, 2011.</p>
<p>He was my husband and he was murdered by Officer Jesus Avalero, who you once called dependable and stated you would stand behind. Fortunately, two years later your opinion about that has seemingly changed. Now you say he is responsible for my husband&#8217;s death, although you still <a href="http://nvcopblock.org/820/unite-with-nevada-cop-block-to-oppose-the-cover-up-of-stanley-gibsons-murder-by-lvmpd/" title="Unite with Nevada Cop Block to Oppose the Cover Up of Stanley Gibson’s Murder by LVMPD">refuse to call it murder</a>. While you finally had the decency to at least fire him, you <a href="http://nvcopblock.org/895/las-vegas-metro-police-chalk-washes-off-but-injustice-never-will/" title="Las Vegas Metro Police: Chalk Washes Off, But Injustice Never Will">still haven&#8217;t held him accountable</a> for his actions that day in any legal manner</a>.</p>
<p>Essentially, his &#8220;punishment&#8221; for shooting my husband, who was both unarmed and innocent, is to have to find another job (after having spent slightly less than two years sitting at home collecting a full paycheck). I don&#8217;t doubt that he will cash in on some connections he made while with Metro to get some cushy security job or something such as that. That&#8217;s not a true punishment, it&#8217;s an inconvenience.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the last 23 months of my life have been nothing but hell. While Jesus Arevalo was on a paid vacation (AKA &#8220;administrative leave&#8221;), I was <a href="http://nvcopblock.org/1152/cops-lvmpd-arent-needed-arent-wanted/" title="No “More Cops” for the LVMPD. They Aren’t Needed and They Aren’t Wanted.">struggling just to pay my rent and other bills</a>. In all that time, I&#8217;ve hardly even really had a chance to grieve for my murdered husband amidst all the calls from collection agencies wanting me to pay for Stanley&#8217;s funeral, which I couldn&#8217;t even afford.</p>
<p>You once claimed at the <a href="http://nvcopblock.org/644/coroners-inquest-reforms-victim-police-intimidation/" title="Don’t Let Coroner’s Inquest Reforms Become Yet Another Victim of Police Intimidation">inquest</a> that you were in contact with me everyday and that you publicly apologized to me, calling Stan&#8217;s death a mistake. Even that&#8217;s a lie. We had never even talked until after that inquest and that only happened because Steve Sanson of <a href="http://vegasallnetradio.com/Shows/VeteransInPolitics.html">VIPI</a> asked you to come and talk to me. That was the first and only time we ever spoke and the apology you gave then was not worth the breath it took to deliver the fake sentiments it represented.</p>
<p>In the 23 months since Stanley was taken from me by Jesus Arevalo and <a href="http://nvcopblock.org/1030/lvmpd-killer-reputation-fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas/" title="Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: The LVMPD’s Killer Reputation">the culture of lawlessness</a> that you continue to enable within Metro by refusing to hold anyone accountable for their actions, no matter how heinous, I had only two requests for you:</p>
<blockquote><p>That Stan&#8217;s medals and other personal belongings from that day be returned to me.<br />
And that someone be held accountable for his murder.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, his medals came home after a lot of unnecessary stalling, but still nobody has actually been held accountable for Stanley&#8217;s murder. Simply being fired isn&#8217;t punishment enough for taking the life of another person. I will not just be standing back and accepting that, either. My third <a href="http://nvcopblock.org/575/statement-of-demands-for-las-vegas-metropolitan-police-depatment-submitted-by-sunet-activist-collective/" title="Statement of Demands for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Depatment – Submitted by Sunset Activist Collective">demand</a> is your immediate resignation as sheriff and I will renew that demand for every one of your successors until they create true accountability within the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.</p>
<p>No more members of <a href="http://nvcopblock.org/119/las-vegas-beware-of-gang-activity-in-your-neighborhood/" title="Las Vegas: Beware of Gang Activity in Your Neighborhood!">this community</a> should have to <a href="http://nvcopblock.org/469/lvmpd-budget-shortages-minorities-recession/" title="LVMPD Budget Cuts: Finally, Minorities Benefit from the Recession">walk around in fear</a> that they will be shot down in cold blood by cops, who know they have <a href="http://nvcopblock.org/222/police-beat-man-in-diabetic-shock-and-nevada-city-pays-for-it/" title="After Henderson Police Beat Man in Diabetic Shock, NV Residents Pay for It (via submission)">no chance of being punished</a> for their actions.

<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">A Community in Fear</span></h2>
<p>Not too long ago I attended a <a title="Don’t Let Coroner’s Inquest Reforms Become Yet Another Victim of Police Intimidation" href="http://nvcopblock.org/644/coroners-inquest-reforms-victim-police-intimidation/">meeting of the Clark County Commissioners</a> concerning a vote over the <a title="Unite with Nevada Cop Block to Oppose the Cover Up of Stanley Gibson’s Murder by LVMPD" href="http://nvcopblock.org/820/unite-with-nevada-cop-block-to-oppose-the-cover-up-of-stanley-gibsons-murder-by-lvmpd/">process that would be adopted to address shootings</a> by Las Vegas area police. Prior to the <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/jan/07/commission-shelves-coroners-inquests-new-police-fa/">vote that eventually happened</a> (after all the important stuff like giving a certificate to a group from a retirement home whose most lauded act was alerting neighbors if they forgot to close their garage door), members of the community were allowed to address the commissioners regarding the issue.</p>
<p>One speaker after another stepped to the microphone and it wasn&#8217;t long at all before a common theme began to develop. Statements such as, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of what will happen if I call the police,&#8221; &#8220;I would never call the police even if I was in real danger because I&#8217;m scared more of them,&#8221; and &#8220;I don&#8217;t trust them not to kill someone if I call them for help&#8221; were recited over and over again throughout the session. These fears were often accompanied by <a href="http://www.ktnv.com/news/local/186099822.html">personal examples of negative experiences</a> resulting from interactions with Las Vegas area police, including several from the families of people that actually had been killed by the police.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">Legitimate Reasons to be Afraid</span></h2>
<div id="attachment_1033" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ChalkThePoliceState-1a.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1033" alt="ChalkThePoliceState 1a 300x167 Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: The LVMPDs Killer Reputation" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ChalkThePoliceState-1a-300x167.jpg" width="300" height="193" title="Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: The LVMPDs Killer Reputation" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">When the cops in Las Vegas kill people their ONLY &#8220;punishment&#8221; is paid leave.</p></div>
<p>Obviously, every time the police respond to a call they don&#8217;t <a href="http://www.ktnv.com/news/local/135427018.html">kill</a> or <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/victim-who-turned-las-vegas-police-officer-when-i-see-cops-im-scared">otherwise abuse</a> the people they encounter, even in Las Vegas. However, <a title="After Henderson Police Beat Man in Diabetic Shock, NV Residents Pay for It (via submission)" href="http://nvcopblock.org/222/police-beat-man-in-diabetic-shock-and-nevada-city-pays-for-it/">it happens often enough</a> to instill the sort of fear and hatred toward them that was on public display during the commissioners&#8217; meeting that day. The problem is that people within the community <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-11-15/news/sns-rt-us-usa-lasvegas-policebre8af05u-20121115_1_james-chips-stewart-shootings-officers">know that should something happen to them or one of their loved ones</a> at the hands of a member of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department they have very little hope of that cop ever being held <a title="The Police Accountability Tour – Coming Soon to a City Near You" href="http://nvcopblock.org/1006/cop-block-police-accountability-tour/">accountable</a> for their actions. They don&#8217;t know that the cop responding wants to kill them, but they do know that if they do they will get away with it.</p>
<p>The bigger problem is that members of Las Vegas area police departments also know this. Jesus Arevalo told his then-wife that <a href="http://nevadapac.ning.com/profiles/blogs/ex-wife-s-new-beau-seeks-a-protective-order-against-stanley-gibso">he wanted to shoot someone</a> so that he could get free time off, based on the policy of placing cops on paid leave during investigations. Within a couple of months after that statement, <a title="Stanley L. Gibson Candlight Vigil: June 12, 2012" href="http://nvcopblock.org/155/stanley-l-gibson-candlight-vigil-june-12-2012/">Stanley Gibson</a>, an unarmed, disabled Persian Gulf veteran suffering from a PTSD induced panic attack and in no way representing a threat to anyone <a title="Justice for Stanley Gibson or Just an End-Around Coroner’s Inquest Reforms?" href="http://nvcopblock.org/265/justice-for-stanley-gibson-or-just-an-end-around-coroners-inquest-reforms/">was murdered by Jesus Arevalo</a>. Those seven unnecessary shots fired from Ofc. Arevalo&#8217;s AR-15 were the ticket to what is fast approaching two full years of the paid vacation that he had indicated he was hoping for. No charges were ever brought against him for his actions, which even other police on the scene characterized as unexplainable in their official statement to the detectives subsequently going through the motions of an investigation. At worst, Arevalo might possibly be punished by <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/may/31/officer-who-killed-gulf-war-vet-stanley-gibson-fac/">being fired</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout their history, the LVMPD has consistently rated <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/deadly-force/quick-shoot-slow-change">among the highest</a> statistically nationwide (even when compared against cities with much higher populations) in times they have <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2010/07/when-police-shoot-unarmed-man-oscar-grant-verdict-Mehserle">shot at people</a> while on duty and in the level of fatalities resulting from those shootings. <a title="WILL THERE EVER BE JUSTICE? by Rondha Gibson" href="http://nvcopblock.org/830/will-there-ever-be-justice-by-rondha-gibson/">Stanley Gibson</a> was just one of the latest names in the laundry list of the <a title="“25 Feet of Injustice” by Ballentine of the Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/724/injustice-ballentine-sunset-activist-collective/">victims of Las Vegas police</a> that includes <a href="http://www.copblock.org/1004/erik-scotts-death-what-happens-in-the-lvmpd-stays-in-the-lvmpd/">Erik Scott</a> (whose murderers were later given an award for bravery while gunning down someone from behind and then unloading their guns on him as he lay already dying on the ground), <a href="http://clarkcountycriminalcops.wordpress.com/2013/05/11/the-lvmpd-gets-some-national-exposure-but-not-in-a-good-way/">Trevon Cole</a>, <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/deadly-force/incident/61">Orlando Barlow</a>, <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/mom-says-teen-was-calm-time-police-arrived">Tanner Chamberlain</a>,  <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/killing-deshira-selimaj">Deshira Selimaj</a>, and <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/analysis-many-las-vegas-police-shootings-could-have-been-avoided">Henry Rowe</a>, among the 150+ shootings just since 1990.</p>
<p>Yet <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/deadly-force/always-justified">not one singular time</a> in the close to forty year history of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has a Las Vegas area police officer ever been charged for shooting someone, regardless of whether the person shot was unarmed or even completely innocent of having committed any actual crime. One rather telling fact is that the reason the old Las Vegas city police was originally merged with the Clark County Sheriff department to create &#8220;Metro&#8221; was in response to an uproar after a very questionable shooting that was ruled justifiable. Yet, no matter how questionable the many shootings by Metro have been, the justifications have continued unabated.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">An Absolute Refusal to Hold ANYONE Accountable</span></h2>
<div id="attachment_1039" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ChalkThePoliceState-12.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1039" alt="ChalkThePoliceState 12 300x143 Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: The LVMPDs Killer Reputation" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ChalkThePoliceState-12-300x143.jpg" width="300" height="194" title="Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: The LVMPDs Killer Reputation" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Finally someone within the Las Vegas police system has made some sort of stand for justice, but will it actually matter?</p></div>
<p>A recent incident has shined a very public spotlight on the reasons why it is so impossible to hold anyone  within the LVMPD accountable for their actions. In one of the <a href="http://www.ktnv.com/news/local/179273091.html">most questionable shootings ever</a> Officer Jacquar Roston claimed to have confused a hat Lawrence Gordon was wearing for a gun and <a href="http://www.ktnv.com/news/local/Man-recounts-shooting-that-led-to-some-Metro-volunteers-resigning-218026951.html">shot him in the leg</a> as he sat in a car. As would be expected of anybody with even half a brain, Metro&#8217;s internal Use of Force Review Board didn&#8217;t really accept that excuse and recommended that Roston be fired  as a result.</p>
<p>The fact that this recommendation was hailed as an &#8220;<a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/unprecedented-move-las-vegas-police-board-recommends-firing-officer-involved">unprecedented</a>&#8221; act by the board tells you a lot about the past history of the Las Vegas police in relation to officer involved shootings. The fact that <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/sheriff-declines-fire-officer-involved-november-shooting">Sheriff Gillespie promptly disregarded that recommendation</a> in favor of a one week unpaid suspension (after Roston had already <a href="http://www.mynews3.com/mostpopular/story/Sheriff-Officer-involved-in-2012-shooting-will/Li2WfVapF0myc7JMVhET2A.cspx">spent 8 months on paid vacation</a> during the investigation) tells you a lot about the prospects for any sort of accountability for them in the near future.</p>
<p>However, in one glimmer of hope for some sort of prospect for justice, seven members of the board did actually have the integrity to <a href="http://m.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/sixth-member-quits-las-vegas-police-departments-use-force-board">stand up and resign in disgust</a> after Gillespie&#8217;s disgraceful action. One former member of the board, Glenn Rinehimer, stated that previously the board had been &#8220;stacked&#8221; with retired police officers from other parts of the country designated as civilians. According to Rinehimer, they didn&#8217;t seem in any hurry to actually investigate whether shootings were justified. “The retired police just didn’t seem interested,” Rinehimer said. “They didn’t ask a lot of questions. They voted quickly for it to be justified.”</p>
<p>Robert Martinez, a co-chair of the board who also resigned, <a href="http://www.mynews3.com/content/news/story/Metro-Use-of-Force-resignation-las-vegas/FgHfMeAtvEeQ7oy0Pwogfg.cspx#.UfkjUyACUEY.facebook">had previously expressed</a> hope that this sort of rubber stamping had ended once former police employees and their family members were banned from being appointed as civilians on the board last year. He believed that Metro truly desired a fair and transparent process. That is until Gillespie essentially exonerated Roston despite the board&#8217;s unanimous recommendation. “I was thoroughly fooled,” Martinez said. “I thought it was going to change and it isn’t.” Within his resignation letter Martinez characterized the process as a flawed one that undermined the Use of Force Review Board.</p>
<div id="attachment_1041" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Gillespie.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1041" alt="Gillespie 300x200 Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: The LVMPDs Killer Reputation" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Gillespie-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" title="Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: The LVMPDs Killer Reputation" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sheriff Gillespie announcing that the final week of Roston&#8217;s 8 month vacation will be unpaid.</p></div>
<p>Former Assistant Sheriff Ted Moody, who submitted for retirement in response to this case, <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/former-senior-cop-says-sheriff-undermined-integrity-shooting-reviews">agreed that Gillespie was undermining the credibility of the board</a> even as Metro faces <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/letters/metros-woes-dont-merit-tax-increase">increasing scrutiny</a> over questionable shootings and other scandals that are becoming hard to even keep up with lately. Las Vegas police officers will not have the public’s trust until the department has a credible process for reviewing its own shootings, Moody stated. And that process must be stable, impartial, unbiased and free from political interference. “Anything short of that is going to fuel further suspicion and mistrust and is just begging for the imposition of externally imposed oversight,” he said. “Nobody wants that. We can be better than that.”</p>
<p>Rinehimer went even further in his assessment of the problems with a system that is in practice designed to ensure no cop is ever held accountable. Rinehimer said the sheriff’s decision to overturn the Use of Force Review Board’s recommendation doesn’t set a good precedent, especially for officers who find themselves in similar situations in the future. “At the end of the day, the officer might be sitting there smiling, knowing the sheriff might not fire him anyway,” Rinehimer said. “It’s a farce.”</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">A Lack of Accountability that is Not Good for Anyone, Even the Police Themselves</span></h2>
<div id="attachment_1043" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ChalkThePoliceState-23.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1043" alt="ChalkThePoliceState 23 300x148 Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: The LVMPDs Killer Reputation" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ChalkThePoliceState-23-300x148.jpg" width="300" height="171" title="Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: The LVMPDs Killer Reputation" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The inevitable backlash</p></div>
<p>There&#8217;s an obvious incentive for members of the community to demand accountability for the heavily armed band patrolling through the streets that they live and work. If those individuals are permitted to act as an<a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2009/05/07/occupying_forces/"> occupying force</a> with the impunity to do as they please to those within that community, those among their ranks that have an unscrupulous tendency will take advantage of that to <a title="Las Vegas: Beware of Gang Activity in Your Neighborhood!" href="http://nvcopblock.org/119/las-vegas-beware-of-gang-activity-in-your-neighborhood/">commit criminal and violent acts</a>.</p>
<p>However, there are reasons why even those within the local police departments should want to see accountability for those &#8220;bad apples&#8221; that we are always being told are just exceptions to the rules. Fear eventually<a title="Las Vegas Metro Police: Chalk Washes Off, But Injustice Never Will" href="http://nvcopblock.org/895/las-vegas-metro-police-chalk-washes-off-but-injustice-never-will/"> gives rise to hostility</a> and working within the bounds of a hostile environment makes someone&#8217;s job just that much harder to do. People within communities don&#8217;t feel real obligated to help with the investigation of crimes when the <a title="“I Want Them to be Afraid Every Time They See the Police”" href="http://nvcopblock.org/64/i-want-them-to-be-afraid-every-time-they-see-the-police/">person doing the investigation</a> is perceived as being <a title="Were Your Father’s Cops Really That Much Better?" href="http://nvcopblock.org/66/were-your-fathers-cops-really-that-much-better/">as bad or worse</a> than the people being investigated. Having to deal with indifference or even<a title="Statement of Demands for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Depatment – Submitted by Sunset Activist Collective" href="http://nvcopblock.org/575/statement-of-demands-for-las-vegas-metropolitan-police-depatment-submitted-by-sunet-activist-collective/"> active retaliation</a> in the process only serves to make the job of the police more difficult and frustrating, which in turn makes them more bitter and cynical and <a title="Peaceful Occupy Reno Memorial Day March Broken up by “Peace” Officers; 10 Arrested" href="http://nvcopblock.org/134/renomemorialdaymarch/">leads to even more abuses</a>. At some point, that downward spiral needs to be put to an end and the only way to do that is to create real accountability, rather than a hollow, toothless sham that does nothing but <a title="Interview With Nevada Cop Block Editor, Kelly W. Patterson, RE: “Second Saturday” Graffiti (Audio Clip)" href="http://nvcopblock.org/923/interview-nevada-cop-block-kelly-patterson-second-saturday-graffiti/">draw attention</a> to the lack of it.  And as Sheriff Gillespie recently found out, people are a lot less accepting of <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/government/county-commissioners-delay-vote-more-cops-sales-tax-hike">having their taxes increased</a> in order to supplement the <a title="LVMPD Budget Cuts: Finally, Minorities Benefit from the Recession" href="http://nvcopblock.org/469/lvmpd-budget-shortages-minorities-recession/">LVMPD&#8217;s budget</a> during an almost daily barrage of news about <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/three-men-file-lawsuit-against-officer-new-years-eve-incident-video">yet another police scandal</a>.</p>

					<p>From <a href="http://www.a-w-i-p.com">Another World Is Possible </a>- an interesting piece explaining the development and history of the modern police establishment -</p>
<blockquote><p>Most people accept this relationship as both given – and eternal. That there have always been men (if not always women)  in costumes “policing” the rest of us. But, in fact, it’s a relatively novel thing. Think back to your schooldays. Do you recall any mention of police when you were learning about the colonial era and the American Revolution? There were sheriffs, yes – and the local militia. But these were concerned mostly with keeping the peace – that is, stepping in when someone harmed someone else. Up to and even during the Civil War – a titanic struggle between the fading remnants of the old republican idea and the centralized, omnipotent state that took its place – the idea of police as we know it was essentially unknown. It is a modern concept – one developed out of the <em>company town</em> idea.</p></blockquote>

<p>The first &#8220;Police Fatality Public Fact-Finding Review,&#8221; regarding the murder of <a href="http://nvcopblock.org/265/justice-for-stanley-gibson-or-just-an-end-around-coroners-inquest-reforms/">Stanley Gibson by Metro Officer Jesus Arevalo</a>, is scheduled to take place on Thursday February 28th beginning at 9:00 am and will be located at the Clark County Government Center, where the Clark County Board of Commissioners hold their regular meetings.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be meeting up at 8:00am in order to organize together and go over the specifics of what we will be doing to bring attention to Stanley&#8217;s murder. It&#8217;s incredibly important for anyone that cares about justice and supports accountability for police that commit crimes against people within the Las Vegas community to be there and make their voice heard for past victims of police violence and to prevent future innocent victims.</p>
<p>In spite of the long-winded name change, the new process that was created by LVMPD&#8217;s Sheriff Gillespie and Chris Collins of the Las Vegas Police Protective Association (Police Union) is designed to do anything but allow the public to find facts. The reality is that it is much worse than the original, much maligned, Coroner&#8217;s Inquest system that it will be replacing.</p>
<p>Unlike the Coroner&#8217;s Inquest, the Police Fatality Review will involve no opportunity for testimony from witnesses and only voluntary testimony by the police involved in the shootings, which the LVPPA has already gone on record as saying that pretty much has no chance of happening. What it amounts to is a choreographed staging of the police department&#8217;s version of events with zero representation from a genuine neutral party, the victim&#8217;s family, or independent witnesses.</p>
<p>Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson actually referred to it as a &#8220;performance,&#8221; while endorsing it, during the Commissioner&#8217;s meeting in which it was initially proposed. That&#8217;s just how much of a blatant and callous cover up the Police Fatality Review is.</p>
<p>The first case to go before this Police Fatality Review involves the murder of Stanley Gibson, an unarmed man who was shot seven times by Jesus Arevalo in spite of having committed no actual crime and having had his vehicle blocked in by several police cars so that it was unable to move.</p>
<p>Stanley, a disabled veteran, who was lost and suffering a panic attack as a result of PTSD and other ailments he suffered during his time in the Persian Gulf, represented no direct or imminent probability of harming anyone at the time.</p>
<p>There was no reason for any of the dozens of heavily armed police to feel in any way threatened by him. And the fact that of all those cops there, only Jesus Arevalo felt the need to fire the shots that killed Stanley Gibson only supports that conclusion.</p>
<div id="attachment_824" style="width: 355px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CautionPoliceState.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-824" alt="CautionPoliceState Unite with Nevada Cop Block to Oppose the Cover Up of Stanley Gibsons Murder by LVMPD" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CautionPoliceState.jpg" width="345" height="400" title="Unite with Nevada Cop Block to Oppose the Cover Up of Stanley Gibsons Murder by LVMPD" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Caution Police State ahead</p></div>
<p>Instead of holding someone that at best was grossly negligent that night accountable for his actions, D.A. Wolfson, Sheriff Gillespie, LVPPA&#8217;s Chris Collins, the Clark County Board of Commissioners, and every other member of the LV Metro Police Department are closing ranks around him in a misguided attempt to cover up yet another officer involved shooting under what could only mildly be called questionable circumstances.</p>
<p>Anyone living in Las Vegas should be well aware that there is a longstanding problem with brutality and outright murder by members of Las Vegas area police departments, especially those of the LVMPD. In several cases, especially those involving Stanley Gibson, Erik Scott, Trevon Cole, Henry Rowe, and Rafael Olivas, the circumstances behind the shooting have been incredibly questionable, if not completely inexcusable.</p>
<p>The obvious reason for the mounting body count by local police is the fact that no Las Vegas area police officer has EVER been held accountable for shooting someone, no matter how questionable that shooting has been.</p>
<p>Replacing what was already a terribly flawed system with one that not only retains those flaws, but incorporates even less transparency and can only be seen as a conscious effort to ensure the police never have to fear being held accountable for deaths they cause not only doesn&#8217;t address this problem, but in reality actually makes it harder for the police to do the things they are supposed to do by creating a lack of trust and discouraging any support for police from the people living within the community that they work.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a self-perpetuating downward spiral that only exacerbates an already toxic and often violent relationship. The time to put an end to this has already passed and things can only get worse at this point if the transparency and accountability that Sheriff Gillespie promises so often isn&#8217;t actually upheld truthfully and with honest intentions.</p>
<p>As of right now, I have been unable to find any info regarding the specifics of the expected length of the kangaroo court that will begin Thursday or restrictions on public entry into the chambers where it will be held. Although, I suspect this lack of information is intentional, if I do come across that information I will post it here.</p>
