<H1 class="header"><A href="/swimming/Survival/" class="line4">1.2 Million People Drown Each&nbsp;Year&nbsp;Worldwide</A></H1><P>
Did you know that the biggest danger to your life at the beach isn't sharks, or jellyfish, or stingrays?
<P>
<STRONG>Drowning</STRONG> is an international epidemic, killing more people each year than malaria, yet it is barely recognised.
<P>
Women&nbsp;seem to be smarter when it comes to water safety.
Around 80% of casualties are men, which is why we focus on educating them via this website.
<P>
Most&nbsp;drownings occur in the world's poorest countries, which have either very limited lifesaving services, or none at all.
In&nbsp;some areas drowning is the leading cause of child death.
<A href="/swimming/Survival/"><B>Read&nbsp;more</B></A>.<BR clear="all">
<P>
<H1 class="header"><A href="/swimming/your-team/" class="line4">England: Not Enough Swimming&nbsp;Lessons</A></H1><P>
Statistics (May&nbsp;2012) show that drowning is the third most common cause of accidental death of children in England,
mainly because many youngsters do not know how to&nbsp;swim.
<P>
According to a report by the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA),
of those who cannot swim, around 200,000 school leavers,
over a third (39%) have never been offered lessons at&nbsp;school.
<A href="/swimming/your-team/"><B>Read&nbsp;more</B></A>.
<P>

<H1 class="header"><A href="/swimming/Survival/clothed-swimming/" class="line4">Drowning in Clothes</A></H1><P>
Japanese police statistics show that 86% of people who drown are fully clothed.
They were simply unprepared.
<P>
Swimming in clothes presents different challenges than a simple bathing suit.
You&nbsp;should practice this with an instructor who guides you through the necessary steps.

Lifesaving is a sport for everyone and a lot more fun than swimming up and down.
It&nbsp;is a&nbsp;valuable community skill that could save&nbsp;lives.
However, many lifesaving clubs focus on competitions or passing exams
rather than training for real life survival.

<H1 class="header"><A href="/swimming/lifesaving/work-as-lifeguard/Staff-training.html" class="line4">Staff Training</A></H1><P>
If you're in charge of a lifeguard team, run weekly staff training.
Make it fun and challenging to keep your team motivated.

<H1 class="header"><A href="/swimming/your-team/Start-now/" class="line4">Start a Lifesaving Team</A></H1><P>
Help your community.
Promote survival swimming and lifesaving through a local swim and rescue team.
Free Lifesaving Teams are fun, simple and agile.
<P>
Many survival and lifeguard teams are very small, often just put together by the team leader.
Some are part of hotel staff or a leisure centre, others are just a group of friends who love swimming.
<P>
Keep to an easy organisational structure, free from committees, governing bodies, and other such overheads.
You don't need a complex swimming club structure.
Run it all from your computer with email and social media, like twitter and facebook.
<P>
This website serves as lesson support system for your lifeguard teams and water safety classes.

<H1 class="header">About Us: Sharing Lifesaving Knowledge</H1><P>
After a few months of preparation,
the Free Lifesaving Society was launched in Hong&nbsp;Kong in&nbsp;2009
to provide free training materials to developing countries.
Now we have friends and teams around the world.
<P>
We share technical expertise and training programmes
to help communities and countries reduce loss of life through drowning,
help establish independent lifesaving teams,
provide teaching assistance,
and support the global exchange of free lifesaving information and resources.
<P>
Some&nbsp;new concepts here may seem unusual at first,
but give them a&nbsp;try and see what works for&nbsp;you and your&nbsp;team.
Learn proven training methods for survival swimming and lifesaving.
<P>
<H2>Working Together</H2><P>
By working together with other organisations and businesses,
we all can have more vision and more ideas about lifesaving.
You can do that through your sponsorships, or your business, and your partnerships with&nbsp;us.
When we all do that together,
we&nbsp;can create a better and safer world to live in.
<P>
You can help by creating content for this website which is read by over 68,000 people every&nbsp;month (July&nbsp;2012).
Take a look around to find pages that need improvement.
Please <STRONG><A href="?mail=1"><U>contact&nbsp;us</U></A></STRONG> with detailed suggestions
and we make the requisite changes where possible.
