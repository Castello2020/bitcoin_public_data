<p>It&#39;s been nearly two decades since Toriyama-sensei ended Dragon Ball. Out of respect for the living legend, we&#39;ve decided to release the first chapter of Jaco the Galatic Patrolman. We have several staunch supporters of Toriyama on staff so I thought it appropro to get their feedback on his new series:</p>
<p><strong>Loki:</strong> My initial impressions were not good. Seeing an alien out of the 1950&#39;s talking with Dr. Jero for almost an entire chapter was underwhelming to say the least. I didn&#39;t expect anything in particular but I had hoped for something with a little more, for lack of better word, &#39;oomph&#39; behind it. I mean this was the man who changed the face of shounen (Tetsuo Hara&nbsp;and Buronson deserve some love here as well) and inspired countless mangaka. Then it occurred to me while I was reading the chapter: Toriyama&#39;s already done enough. He doesn&#39;t need to make another hit series. He&#39;s already cemented his place in history. I should just enjoy this condensed series (it appears that it will last 20-30 chapters at most) for what it is (or isn&#39;t). Will it be the next big thing? Hardly. I reckon most people will mock and ridicule it and point out all of it&#39;s shortcomings. On the surface, Jaco appears to be something pulled out of the late 80&#39;s and&nbsp;maybe that&#39;s a good thing...</p>
<p><strong>Prostyle:</strong>&nbsp;Toriyama-sensei is a cyborg! It would appear as if Toriyama-sensei up until now has been in a cryostasis chamber ever since the 90s and has been woken up just now for the sake of creating epic series. Unfortunately my theory is that the cryostasis chamber has malfunctioned and has left our beloved mangaka-bot in a state which only allows him to produce work suited for the 90s. Proof for that is the art style resembling frickin&#39; Dragon Ball which is pretty yucky to a newagefanboiii like me but according to an accomplice of mine here at MS back when DB first came out it was like Jesus came out of the cave after the 3 days... so I&#39;ll take their word for it. Prepare for shots fired, what grinds my gears is the space ship. It&#39;s supposed to look frickin&#39; cool, and instead what we get is a &#39;trivial&#39; space craft that&#39;s popular among kindergarteners. Hey that might be the aimed demographic but call me cynical, it&#39;s very far away from my cup of tea. And even though some might negatively judge the main protagonist for being an alien, I actually accept the idea since to me it&#39;s a bit unorthodox, and me like unorthodox. With all of that the positives of this new series are now over. Everything else just seems out of date and even though people freaked the f#$% out when it was announced, it has came to disappoint at a level my English can&#39;t put into words. I sincerely hope somebody does enjoy it because I simply cannot.</p>
<p><strong>Jero:</strong>&nbsp;As someone who knows there are mangaka that work their entire lives without ever managing to get serialized in Jump&hellip;. this better be leading up to something good, since it&#39;s anything but, for the first chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Mankai:</strong> Lately when I wake up, I&#39;ve been getting massive boogers. In both nostrils. I&#39;m talking boulder size nuggets here. I don&#39;t know, maybe it&#39;s my diet. But I digress... look, anyone other than Toriyama shows up at JUMP with Jaco and they get laughed and beaten&nbsp;out of the building. Anyone who says otherwise is blinded by their fanboyism. Fact of the matter is, the man will get a lifetime pass to publish anything he wants to get published. If he wanted to serialize a&nbsp;spermatozoon traveling into an ovum and forming a zygote, the editors at JUMP would ask him to get started on it ASAP.&nbsp;He singlehandely turned JUMP into a juggernaut from the 80&#39;s into the 90&#39;s. Does that mean the readers should give him a pass for this sub-par series? Of course not. Feel free to judge it on its merits as you would any new series. And as such, I can only imagine the staunchest of Toriyama supporters finding joy in reading this series, whether it be for nostalgic reasons or simply out of respect. I for one plan on reading it for both.</p>
<p><strong>Jinn:</strong> Do you know what it&#39;s like when you feel nostalgic about an old game you used to love as a kid, or an old TV series or movie? You have this urge to go and play / watch it, but when you do you realize that your memory of it was much better than it actually is (now) and you wish you hadn&#39;t tried it? Well, it&#39;s something like this with this new Toriyama series, except I rewatched Dragon Ball only a couple months ago and it still rocked, whereas this series... I am disappoint, and wish he hadn&#39;t given it another try.</p>
<p><strong>ikore:</strong>&nbsp;Having never read or watched Dragon Ball (I&#39;m sure some of you would kill me for that), I read this without any expectations at all. After seeing the raws I really didn&#39;t know what to think of it, it seemed awkward. The art is not really my cup of tea, but that&#39;s probably me not being used to that kind of style. The story is unique, but not that appealing in my opinion. I don&#39;t think someone else could&#39;ve gotten in JUMP with a story like this, it doesn&#39;t feel like it lives up to the other series in the magazine. I hope at least some of you guys like it, as I simply couldn&#39;t.</p>
<p><strong>Tryhard:&nbsp;</strong>I, myself, am a huuuuge fan of Toriyama-sensei, obviously because of Dragon Ball. It took up a lot of my childhood hours, watching episode after episode and I still watch it occasionally because it was just THAT amazing to me. With this series however, I think he&#39;s been lazy or just wanted to do something to occupy his time because it is leagues away from Dragon Ball&#39;s quality. Anyway, the wholepoint of this is just to say that I agree with what Loki said... the man&#39;s already got his place in the history books and made himself a legend, so he doesn&#39;t need to work as hard as others to create a &quot;flagship&quot; series. I&#39;m disappointed with this new series, but overall, I am still an enormous fan of the man behind it all, Akira Toriyama-sensei.</p>
