<p>Wow, I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been almost half a year already since we last released a chapter of Green Blood. Time sure flies, huh.</p>
<p>Well, I have no excuses, really. It&#39;s been the usual. You know, personal life getting in the way, having to find a new translator - all that usual jazz.</p>
<p>We do have something to make up for it though. That&#39;s right, we&#39;ve been working on these like madmen this past week and are now proud to deliver a whooping 5 new chapters to you! Chapters 24 to 27 cover the rest of volume 3, while chapter 28 marks the beginning of volume 4.</p>
<p>Also some more news for you - the series officially ended a couple months ago in Japan with chapter 49. In other words, we have 21 chapters to go for the awesome finale of the series! And don&#39;t be upset &#39;cause you&#39;ll miss all the amazing art. The mangaka actually started working on a new series last month, one about Roman warriors, which looks equally as boss as Green Blood. We&#39;ll probably get all over it once we&#39;re done with Green Blood, but no promises made!</p>

<h2><a href="http://mangastream.com/blog/16">Early Jump, Late Jump </a></h2>
<small>Posted Aug 21st, 2013 by <strong>Jinn</strong></small>
<p>Since so many of you have been asking for updates on Jump and even more complained about the lack of it while it&#39;s out on other websites, we figured some things should be clarified.</p>
<p>Jump was on break last week due to Japanese holidays and so the new chapters of Naruto and One Piece are scheduled for today. In fact, we&#39;re currently slowly working on them. Slowly because many of our staff are away for various reasons, most of them simply being on holidays. In other words, it&#39;ll still take us a while, as unfortunate as that may be. Don&#39;t expect it before tomorrow morning GMT.</p>
<p>As for the leak of the super early Jump over the weekend on other websites? See, what happened was that the Chinese official publisher, who gets the official chapters way in advance much like Viz in America, leaked those super early chapters. Whether it was the actual publisher or some individual within the company or w/e, we have no idea. Several&nbsp;groups went ahead and slapped a shitty Japanese -&gt; Chinese -&gt; English translation on those leaked chapters and released them. We&#39;d rather not tread into such murky waters so we&#39;ll just continue doing things our usual way.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience guys and we&#39;ll get the newest releases out as quick as humanly possible.</p>

<small>Posted Aug 9th, 2013 by <strong>Jinn</strong></small>
<p><strong>The End Of Yet Another Great Series</strong></p>
<p>I know, I know. We haven&#39;t worked on this series in a long time. Still, it&#39;s one of those series that goes way back for some of our staff, as far as the good ol&#39; Binktopia days even. As a team, we never forget the series we once worked on together and when they come to an end we try and release those final chapters in a combination of &#39;honoring&#39; the series and its mangaka(s) and honoring the staff members that used to work on them. Sounds a bit corny, but whatever, that&#39;s how it is.</p>
<p>With that said, look forward to the last and final chapter of Soul Eater - now available for your reading pleasure here on MangaStream.</p>

<h2><a href="http://mangastream.com/blog/14">Jump on Break Next Week</a></h2>
<small>Posted Aug 7th, 2013 by <strong>loki</strong></small>
<p>So the title is self explanatory. Those of you familiar with how it works, however, should be aware of the&nbsp;small possibility that the next issue may in fact arrive extraordinarily early. There&#39;s no way to predict this other than for you to go out in public, drop your pants (or shorts), bend over and recite the alphabet backwards. If you do this (which I highly recommend) you&#39;ll without a doubt acquire the knowledge you seek. Not just for JUMP, but for life.</p>
<p>Stay tuned throughout the week as I&#39;ll be sure to post any relevent updates if and when they arrive.</p>
<p>Edit: For those of you unaware, FT and HSDK is on hiatus this week. Again, small possibility of it landing but don&#39;t hold your breath.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a href="http://mangastream.com/blog/13">The End Of A Great Series</a></h2>
<small>Posted Jul 28th, 2013 by <strong>Jinn</strong></small>
<p>Sad news for all you Deadman Wonderland fans out there; we&#39;re about to release the final chapter. It&#39;s been a great run since 2007 and all of us at MangaStream are saddened to see it end but at the same time we&#39;re happy to have worked on this outstanding series. Personally, I haven&#39;t been involved in working on that many chapters, so I asked two of the main people involved to give their comments.</p>
<p>ikore, the driving force behind the editing and generally in charge of the project:</p>
<p><em>I scanlated Deadman Wonderland from the moment I started scanlation, working on it until Mangastream picked it up. Fast forward a year and a few months, I find myself working on it again. I&#39;m glad I could work on this all the way to the final chapter. Thanks for reading!</em></p>
<p>waychanger, our most awesome translator:</p>
<p><em>It was my suggestion for Mangastream to pick up Deadman Wonderland when I joined MS more than 2 years ago (at the time, it was essentially the only manga I read that Mangastream didn&#39;t already carry), and now, finally, I am happy to see it through to completion, many chapters and an incredibly long (mangaka) hiatus later. I hope everyone has enjoyed following this manga along with myself and the rest of the Mangastream team. Thanks!</em></p>
<p>Did the series get the ending it deserves? Let us know what you think!</p>

<h2><a href="http://mangastream.com/blog/12">Hajime no Ippo Anime 3rd Season Coming This Fall</a></h2>
<small>Posted Jul 25th, 2013 by <strong>Jinn</strong></small>
<p>That&#39;s right, the long wait will be finally over soon. And before anyone else points it out - yes, I&#39;m a week late with this, but I just found out and I&#39;m super psyched about it, so cut me some slack.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the new season will cover all the way up to Takamura vs Eagle and, of course, include Ippo vs Sawamura. There&#39;s no word on how long exactly it will run though, but those two fights are worth it alone and it&#39;s gonna be awesome, I just know it.</p>
<p>There is only one thing that kind of worries me; and that is whether the new voice actor will do coach Kamogawa justice. If you haven&#39;t heard, the old voice actor, Kenji Utsumi, died of cancer this past June, aged 75.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer the inevitable nagging: No, we have not stopped working on the manga. And since I&#39;m tired of people asking us for Ippo I&#39;ll even let you in on a secret. Or well, I&#39;ll tell you something about the internal process of getting the series out for everyone&#39;s reading pleasure.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve been working with Ignitione-One (another scanlation team) since we picked up the series about 100 chapters ago. They have actually worked on it for science knows how many chapters; 500? Lots. Someone go on <strong><a href="http://www.confusticated.com/ignition-one/Hajime_no_Ippo/001/01/1100/1/">their reader</a>,</strong> find out and be easily the smartest person in the comments list please? But anyway, the point is that two parties are involved in delivering a new chapter. They have since been responsible for the translation and the proofreading of said translation, while we&#39;ve been acquiring the magazine, cleaning the chapters, redrawing and typesetting - and of course hosting it.</p>
<p>All of us at mangastream have tremendous respect for the work they do, how natural and realistic they make the dialogs sound, and we&#39;d not want to work with any other translators on this series. Unfortunately, they&#39;ve been rather busy in the last couple weeks and months, with all sorts of private troubles and problems. Essentially, we&#39;re waiting for translations to arrive in order to release more chapters. There&#39;s no way to speed up the process at our end and thus there&#39;s nothing we can do. All we can do, just like you readers, is wait - and occasionally send out naggy emails.</p>
<p>Since I know you don&#39;t have their email addresses and wouldn&#39;t dream of sharing those, I&#39;ll share something else with you. <a href="http://www.dynamiteglove.org/"><strong>This</strong></a> is their forum. I&#39;m posting it for two reasons. One, it&#39;s a pretty fine forum to discuss anything related to Ippo and a bunch of other things and two, you can nag at them instead of at us - letting them know how much you want new chapters. However, please understand that it&#39;s not like they consciously choose to be &quot;slow&quot;. So keep that in mind, be respectful and encouraging, instead of brainless, raging and annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And since this blog post is getting way too long now anyway, I&#39;ll close it by saying: YATTA YATTA, NEW IPPO COMING SOON!</p>
<p>PS: Who else is gonna rewatch the first two seasons in the meantime? *Raises both hands* &quot;Me me me!&quot;</p>

<small>Posted Jul 16th, 2013 by <strong>loki</strong></small>
<p>So it looks like Bleach is having its last call. Confirmed in this weeks issue of jump. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/N8xXrq8.jpg">Here</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/G4Dt4VH.jpg">here</a>. Rough translation is as follows:<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px"><em>After this weeks issue, Bleach will be on hiatus from Jump 35-40.&nbsp;Starting from jump 41 (09/09), the last arc &quot;1000 years Blood Ward Arc - The Separation Story&quot; will start.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left:40px"><em>Before the last battle, i will be going on a long hiatus so that I can approach the final battle fully charged and give it my absolute all. When the manga resumes, please prepare yourselves for the&nbsp;&quot;1000 years Blood Ward Arc - The Separation Story&quot;.</em></p>
<p><br/>
<strong>Edit:</strong> This week&#39;s issue is 34 fyi</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Looks like I&#39;m just the bearer of great news today. One Piece will also be on hiatus next week.&nbsp;</p>

<small>Posted Jul 10th, 2013 by <strong>loki</strong></small>
<p>It&#39;s been nearly two decades since Toriyama-sensei ended Dragon Ball. Out of respect for the living legend, we&#39;ve decided to release the first chapter of Jaco the Galatic Patrolman. We have several staunch supporters of Toriyama on staff so I thought it appropro to get their feedback on his new series:</p>
<p><strong>Loki:</strong> My initial impressions were not good. Seeing an alien out of the 1950&#39;s talking with Dr. Jero for almost an entire chapter was underwhelming to say the least. I didn&#39;t expect anything in particular but I had hoped for something with a little more, for lack of better word, &#39;oomph&#39; behind it. I mean this was the man who changed the face of shounen (Tetsuo Hara&nbsp;and Buronson deserve some love here as well) and inspired countless mangaka. Then it occurred to me while I was reading the chapter: Toriyama&#39;s already done enough. He doesn&#39;t need to make another hit series. He&#39;s already cemented his place in history. I should just enjoy this condensed series (it appears that it will last 20-30 chapters at most) for what it is (or isn&#39;t). Will it be the next big thing? Hardly. I reckon most people will mock and ridicule it and point out all of it&#39;s shortcomings. On the surface, Jaco appears to be something pulled out of the late 80&#39;s and&nbsp;maybe that&#39;s a good thing...</p>
<p><strong>Prostyle:</strong>&nbsp;Toriyama-sensei is a cyborg! It would appear as if Toriyama-sensei up until now has been in a cryostasis chamber ever since the 90s and has been woken up just now for the sake of creating epic series. Unfortunately my theory is that the cryostasis chamber has malfunctioned and has left our beloved mangaka-bot in a state which only allows him to produce work suited for the 90s. Proof for that is the art style resembling frickin&#39; Dragon Ball which is pretty yucky to a newagefanboiii like me but according to an accomplice of mine here at MS back when DB first came out it was like Jesus came out of the cave after the 3 days... so I&#39;ll take their word for it. Prepare for shots fired, what grinds my gears is the space ship. It&#39;s supposed to look frickin&#39; cool, and instead what we get is a &#39;trivial&#39; space craft that&#39;s popular among kindergarteners. Hey that might be the aimed demographic but call me cynical, it&#39;s very far away from my cup of tea. And even though some might negatively judge the main protagonist for being an alien, I actually accept the idea since to me it&#39;s a bit unorthodox, and me like unorthodox. With all of that the positives of this new series are now over. Everything else just seems out of date and even though people freaked the f#$% out when it was announced, it has came to disappoint at a level my English can&#39;t put into words. I sincerely hope somebody does enjoy it because I simply cannot.</p>
<p><strong>Jero:</strong>&nbsp;As someone who knows there are mangaka that work their entire lives without ever managing to get serialized in Jump&hellip;. this better be leading up to something good, since it&#39;s anything but, for the first chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Mankai:</strong> Lately when I wake up, I&#39;ve been getting massive boogers. In both nostrils. I&#39;m talking boulder size nuggets here. I don&#39;t know, maybe it&#39;s my diet. But I digress... look, anyone other than Toriyama shows up at JUMP with Jaco and they get laughed and beaten&nbsp;out of the building. Anyone who says otherwise is blinded by their fanboyism. Fact of the matter is, the man will get a lifetime pass to publish anything he wants to get published. If he wanted to serialize a&nbsp;spermatozoon traveling into an ovum and forming a zygote, the editors at JUMP would ask him to get started on it ASAP.&nbsp;He singlehandely turned JUMP into a juggernaut from the 80&#39;s into the 90&#39;s. Does that mean the readers should give him a pass for this sub-par series? Of course not. Feel free to judge it on its merits as you would any new series. And as such, I can only imagine the staunchest of Toriyama supporters finding joy in reading this series, whether it be for nostalgic reasons or simply out of respect. I for one plan on reading it for both.</p>
<p><strong>Jinn:</strong> Do you know what it&#39;s like when you feel nostalgic about an old game you used to love as a kid, or an old TV series or movie? You have this urge to go and play / watch it, but when you do you realize that your memory of it was much better than it actually is (now) and you wish you hadn&#39;t tried it? Well, it&#39;s something like this with this new Toriyama series, except I rewatched Dragon Ball only a couple months ago and it still rocked, whereas this series... I am disappoint, and wish he hadn&#39;t given it another try.</p>
<p><strong>ikore:</strong>&nbsp;Having never read or watched Dragon Ball (I&#39;m sure some of you would kill me for that), I read this without any expectations at all. After seeing the raws I really didn&#39;t know what to think of it, it seemed awkward. The art is not really my cup of tea, but that&#39;s probably me not being used to that kind of style. The story is unique, but not that appealing in my opinion. I don&#39;t think someone else could&#39;ve gotten in JUMP with a story like this, it doesn&#39;t feel like it lives up to the other series in the magazine. I hope at least some of you guys like it, as I simply couldn&#39;t.</p>
<p><strong>Tryhard:&nbsp;</strong>I, myself, am a huuuuge fan of Toriyama-sensei, obviously because of Dragon Ball. It took up a lot of my childhood hours, watching episode after episode and I still watch it occasionally because it was just THAT amazing to me. With this series however, I think he&#39;s been lazy or just wanted to do something to occupy his time because it is leagues away from Dragon Ball&#39;s quality. Anyway, the wholepoint of this is just to say that I agree with what Loki said... the man&#39;s already got his place in the history books and made himself a legend, so he doesn&#39;t need to work as hard as others to create a &quot;flagship&quot; series. I&#39;m disappointed with this new series, but overall, I am still an enormous fan of the man behind it all, Akira Toriyama-sensei.</p>

<small>Posted Jul 9th, 2013 by <strong>loki</strong></small>
<p>From the mangaka who brought you FullMetal Alchemist&nbsp;comes a modern day adaptation of the acclaimed novel series Arslan Senki. It&nbsp;has often been called Japan&#39;s Narnia (whether or not&nbsp;that is a fair and accurate assessment I leave up for the reader to judge). Without further ado, we proudly present&nbsp;<a href="http://mangastream.com/read/arslan/1/1977/1">The Heroic Legend of Arslan</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="http://mangastream.com/blog/1">Pancakes For All</a></h2>
<small>Posted Jul 4th, 2013 by <strong>loki</strong></small>
<p>At ease minions, the sky is not falling and you&#39;re not having a stroke, MangaStream has been re-tooled for your benefit.</p>
<p>Change is a scary&nbsp;thing, we&#39;ve resisted it for years, but sometimes it has to be embraced. One thing we tried to maintain with the&nbsp;updated&nbsp;layout was a sense of familiarity as far as positioning&nbsp;and overall aesthetics go. It&#39;s unmistakably&nbsp;different, but hopefully it still feels like MangaStream as you&#39;re flipping through and you&#39;ll get comfortable with it quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Yadda yadda, how does this&nbsp;benefit me?</strong></p>
<p>Not only did the front-end get an overhaul, but the back-end was completely rewritten from scratch with some&nbsp;goals in mind.</p>
<p>In our adolescence&nbsp;we had a pretty nice theming feature, but were forced to get rid of it in favor of static caching since our original codebase didn&#39;t anticipate the website peaking at a bazillion quadfinity pageviews per nanosecond. We&#39;ve added this feature back into the website, and you can find it in the top right of the page. We will add more themes in the future as time permits.</p>
<p>When Twitter took their ball and went&nbsp;home, too many of our readers were cut off from us since we didn&#39;t have a&nbsp;news platform on the site. As you read this article, you&#39;re now realizing that this is a news platform! We will share&nbsp;important delays&nbsp;(Golden Week, double issues, my bad hair days&nbsp;etc.)&nbsp;and release updates on this blog, and you can hit us back and chat with other fans&nbsp;in the new comment section you&#39;ll find inside every&nbsp;post.</p>
<p>I want to avoid going into an exhaustive list, so the final big change you&#39;ll notice with the website is the new responsive design. We want everyone to have a similar experience browsing MangaStream whether they&#39;re on a Phone, Potato, Tablet or PC master-race. We&#39;ll be actively working out any kinks that people find with display issues on different devices, you can report anything you find in the comments.</p>
<p>Enjoy it, my prized minions!</p>
<p><strong>Edit: </strong>Comments now enabled at the end of each chapter and <a href="http://mangastream.com/settings">a&nbsp;new settings feature</a> has been added so that each viewer can customize their experience on the site</p>
