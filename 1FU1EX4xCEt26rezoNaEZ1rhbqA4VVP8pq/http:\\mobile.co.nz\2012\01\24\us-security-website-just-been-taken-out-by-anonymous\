US Security Website Just Been Taken Out By Anonymous
January 24, 2012By The ArchitectDigg Digg
The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are the latest victims of the wrath of Anonymous. Their website being hacked and taken down by Anonymous hackers in protest against the MegaUpload episode.
This is extra embarrasing fro the US Gov as the FTC is supposed to provide Internet security solution and advice to its consumers. Hacktivists not only left their ” We are Legion” message but also gained access to back-end MySQL database and ended up with leaking complete list of login details, consisting of password hashes on http://pastebin.com/mJWUDtGD.
