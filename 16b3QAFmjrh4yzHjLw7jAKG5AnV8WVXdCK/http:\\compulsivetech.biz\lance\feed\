				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As some know, the Raspberry Pi has become nothing but über popular. With that being said, we&#8217;re getting more and more new users who aren&#8217;t familiar with the Linux/UNIX-like environment. This is why VSTheWeb.com &#8220;Lab&#8221; will be offering 1-Click popular Raspberry Pi Installers right from here in the VegasTech Community (<a title="VegasTech - Las Vegas Tech Community" href="http://vegastech.com" target="_blank">http://vegastech.com</a>).</p>
<p>So, how does it work? You simply insert your Pi details and let the web installer remotely connect to your from ANYWHERE. Eventually you&#8217;ll be able to populate a list of offerings to then group install or single-install and perhaps if all goes well, we can do scheduled installs or multi-Pi installs.</p>
<p>The other things you can expect is packages or bundles if you will. So if you&#8217;re going to learn NodeJS, PostgresQL everything you could ever want like gpadmin3, etc to help you use it will be installed for you. Ideally this could save people time, why launch Git commands or wget files when you can set up a tiny repo or useful packages (like how PiCAST 1.x did) but also cross-install for perhaps a class you&#8217;ll be teaching.</p>
<p>Opportunity to make this useful is endless, but of course it always depends on having the time and sadly funding myself only occurs by constantly doing projects as a contractor. So, bear with me and if you&#8217;re looking to get your packages added to the site? Let me know, perhaps we can start working on getting you in early.</p>
<p>So, try it out today at: <a title="NodeJS Web Auto-Installer for Raspberry Pi" href="http://vstheweb.com/lab/nodeJS" target="_blank">http://vstheweb.com/lab/nodeJS</a> &amp; remember, it is always in dev-production-public mode.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately I have blogged more and more about 3D Printing or automated printing things using batter for Pancakes. So, I thought I would share some of my own works&#8230;</p>
<p>As some of you know, when I publish to thingiverse that you see on Twitter, normally is a Cookie Cutter? Yes, I co-own a Candy, Cake, Cookie Company and sometimes we need to make the item a little more special than normal. With that being said, creating the shape of an item then 3D Printing them is a great way to go the extra mile and making my own Cookie Cutter and spending way less than the normal $8-30/Cutter (not-customized).</p>
<p>So, if you feel like making some cookies, have a 3D Printer or like one of my Cutters but can&#8217;t get it printed? Wrong, I offer a 3D Printing service. I&#8217;ve printed many of my designs for people and sometimes even create people custom ones. If you <a title="Request my Services" href="http://compulsivetech.biz/lance/3d-wearables" target="_blank">click on the 3D/Wearable link</a>, you can request a custom quote.</p>
<p>If you do end up making some cookies, please send the photos my way, love to see what you made! Go on, <a title="Lance Seidman - 3D Designs" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/lseidman/designs" target="_blank">check out my Designs</a> &amp; get printing!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems more and more edible 3D Printing is going to arrive but now we have maybe a different class of Printers for edibles&#8230; PancakeBot!</p>
<p>At Maker Faire Bay Area, the PancakeBot is the Printer where &#8220;batter not included&#8221;. In the demo they show the dream world where we wake up and we can have more than just Mickey Mouse pancakes. Now we can get really adventurous!</p>
<p>This is assuming this becomes a product that comes to fruition for our consuming and breakfast loving desires. I can see stores offer this service to advertise new menu items or simply place your bill on a pancake to save on paper. The next printer we may see, I can&#8217;t even say really as this shows us not everything has to be 3D but having automation and customization with little skill? Sounds good to me!</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t bore you any further, checkout the demo they made below or <a title="PancakeBot (Marked SAFE by Lance)" href="http://www.pancakebot.com" target="_blank">visit the website</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I and some of the tech community have recently heard about this App called We Heart It, a Pinterest meets Flickr and every other image/video stream service but only with a slight twist, you heart what inspires you.</p>
<p>Now the concept really is nothing new, it is gorgeous but the big question is, they claim to have MILLIONS of users but who are these “WE THE PEOPLE”? Most of us have never heard of this App and really likely have zero interest in it as it doesn&#8217;t give something new or that interesting worth losing hours over. The design itself isn&#8217;t even something to write home about, so what the heck and where the heck did this App come from?</p>
<p>I can’t truly find anyone I know that has heard of the App or has known anyone to use it let alone an actual user. How do Apps like this gain so much traction in such short amount of time and without ever being published or spoken about daily? Is the dark side of the internet something that is actually real, that doesn&#8217;t have techy people crossing the line? Time will tell as we have more questions than statements.</p>
<p>What we do know, is you and I both know they may have a chance in the mobile game as the links they offer are monetized by VigLink. This is a great model if you really think about it. With Facebook, Twitter, and the others always being yelled at for targeting Ads with a big Ad display… It seems maybe this wannabe native-like advertising is how we’ll be tricked into thinking Ads just don’t exist anymore.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I am still on the search to find who WE are and how they started using this App or even found out about it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As many in what&#8217;s called the &#8220;Maker&#8221; community, which also refers to the DIY (Do It Yourself) community, know 3D Printing is becoming easier and easier&#8230; It&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ve heard NASA saying or even seen trying to send a 3D Printer to space to help build tools they may need in space but before we get giddy or too off-topic, why do we even know or why is this technology even existing as a name to regular &#8220;Joe&#8221; or &#8220;Jane&#8221;?</p>
<p>It all starts becoming a household term more and more thanks to &#8220;affordable&#8221; at-home products from companies like Printrbot, 3D Systems, and MakerBot being the most well-known who was acquired by Stratasys for a whopping $403 Million (based on stock value at purchase) in which its year anniversary is approaching with CEO/Founder Bre Pettis as he has been a preacher for this future for many years now.</p>
<p>But the list is small and not nearly all the brands that exist, likely thanks to Kickstarter and Indiegogo. But we&#8217;re done talking about the Plastic 3D Printers, lets talk about the future when we can have our Smartphones that terrify us detect how long till we&#8217;re home, know we&#8217;re having a bad day, and turn on our 3D chocolate printer to print a smiley face or a Jolly Rancher-like sugar candy with a photo of the latest internet cat meme and not a sugar fan? Some of the best Belgian chocolate to change our mood for when we get home to relax with.</p>
<p>On a more serious note, if you attended the 2014 CES in Las Vegas, you know 3D Printing was one of the biggest buzz words but what you might have missed? Was a few companies trying to bring us an affordable chocolate printer and hard candy (sugar) printers for our kitchen! Did you ever imagine when Willy Wonka (movie; not the scary one from the book) said &#8220;Want to change the world, there&#8217;s nothing to it&#8221;, boy he didn&#8217;t know we&#8217;d be able to dream like dreamers thanks to the tech world.</p>
<p>Now we have to wonder, will see an explosion of new startups pop-up to make edible 3D printers like Choc Edge, which is allowing you to print sculptures and whatever you want. It seems more and more that the ChefJet printer may be your first kitchen edible printer as it can print your hard candy desires and to likely last longer than something from chocolate.</p>
<p>But why should you care? You really need to appreciate the science behind it all for starters, then the creators of the devices who craft these remarkable devices that could help bring food in another form for Adults or Kids who normally wouldn&#8217;t eat something because the way it looks. Right now we&#8217;re talking about sugar-based snacks but imagine the businesses that can come from prototyping the next big candy bar that can last in the sun without using wax and chemicals we can&#8217;t pronounce. Possibly become small businesses who can print edibles at home or for those who want to go really futuristic, just give the schematic to print the new creation you imagined for free or for a tiny fee per print using the Cloud.</p>
<p>The time has never been more clear that we are done waiting for the OK to do something by big corporations who normally shine the light in the next direction. Technology is making us more advanced than ever. The future is right now but the question is? How does it taste and did you get my link for the dinner I planned from my OneDrive account to print tonight?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you know, in the world of surveillance, we have lost our freedom, doesn&#8217;t matter what country you live in but as an American we have the fear of the NSA and big &#8220;GOV&#8221;.</p>
<p>Some of us for years have said they could do this and that, of course we have been labeled: tin foil hatters; paranoid schizos; libertarians and that&#8217;s far from the truth thanks to recent leaks in the past year. We&#8217;ve been right but the sad part is? I wish it wasn&#8217;t true. I&#8217;ve lost respect for these agencies that I always had the highest regards for, it&#8217;s like finding out your favorite superhero is a D.A.R.E. dropout who chain smokes, beats his ex-wife who&#8217;s locked in a storage container under 20 Ft. of concrete in an abandoned farm&#8230; To say the least, I am sad.</p>
<p>That being said, we as citizens of the Internet must not only fight against being spied upon but really just prevent attackers who want our data that will actually use our data immediately against us, opposed to sometime in the possible future. Which if you haven&#8217;t paid attention, I am betting you haven&#8217;t, SSL (Hint: The lock you&#8217;re supposed to see on &#8220;Secure checkout&#8221; from eBay, Microsoft, Amazon&#8230;?) is the process of pairing two communications together to share a set of data via a Packet. Ideally, if setup right (we&#8217;ve seen otherwise), that data transferred is supposed to be merely &#8220;IMPOSSIBLE&#8221; to MITM attack it or be stored on a server.</p>
<p>So what can you do besides beg these companies to upgrade? We&#8217;ll, Google is attempting to go in another direction but really we can do one thing right now that is FREE and available to ALL. It&#8217;s called DNSCrypt. This will help on the local level make sure the communications aren&#8217;t tampered or intercepted (on the local level at least).</p>
<p>How do you get started? I will assume you&#8217;re on Windows (other tutorials are coming and videos now on <a title="DNSCrypt (YouTube - TechMeShow)" href="http://youtu.be/Y0ujcJuMJMs" target="_blank">YouTube &#8211; TechMeShow</a>), so <a title="DNSCrypt Windows ZIP File" href="http://download.dnscrypt.org/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-proxy-win32-full-1.3.3.zip" target="_blank">download the free edition from the DNSCrypt Site</a>. Now follow the below steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Locate the download (Right-Click the ZIP file and go to Properties and click &#8220;Unblock&#8221;); Now Unzip the archive (somewhere you&#8217;ll never delete or remove).</li>
<li>Open a Command Prompt (Windows Key + R, type cmd &amp; press enter or OK). Now type cd and type the Path to where the files you unzipped are.<br />
Hint: If you unzipped to Downloads (defaults to your Account on Win7-8), you&#8217;d type: cd Downloads/dnscrypt-proxy-win32-full-1.3.3\dnscrypt-proxy-win32-full\bin.</li>
<li>Lets test the file, go forth and type dnscrypt-proxy.exe and press enter. If it shows &#8220;Proxying&#8221;, you&#8217;re good (see sample).<a href="http://compulsivetech.biz/lance/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/dcproxy-ss1.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1154" alt="DNSCrypt" src="http://compulsivetech.biz/lance/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/dcproxy-ss1-300x151.png" width="300" height="151" /></a></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Setup Network Adapter</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open a Folder or right-click your Ethernet/Wi-Fi Adapter in the bottom right near your clock.</li>
<li>Navigate to&nbsp;Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network Connections.</li>
<li>Find your Adapter, mine is Wi-Fi. Right-Click it and go to Properties.</li>
<li>In the Protocols list, find &#8220;TCP/IPv4&#8243; and click Properties.</li>
<li>In the second option for DNS, click &#8220;Use the following DNS&#8230;&#8221;.</li>
<li>First field, type 127.0.0.1 (can&#8217;t use periods, match each number with some box shown).</li>
<li>Press Ok; Now press Close. You&#8217;re Done!</li>
</ol>
<p>How do you know it worked? If you can visit .bit sites like http://okturtles.bit&nbsp;or .dns, you&#8217;re good to go. You can also tell by going into your command prompt, and type ipconfig/all and look at your DNS, it should be encrypted.</p>
<p>This is safety for yourselves, when you can&#8217;t trust must encryption or security.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As someone who has been fascinated by the WP platform and saw previews before it was ever released- I wanted in on it!</p>
<p>When finally the WP7 came out and we had a platform to physically hold and work with, it was GREAT. Of course having missing things like Copy &#038; Paste was an embarrassment but a new update would come in Months to be.</p>
<p>It was awful when we found out our WP7&#8242;s couldn&#8217;t upgrade to WP8 as we all thought we were going to be able to do. Yet another JAB into the gut. Especially being promised we&#8217;ll always get new updates for our WP8 devices&#8230; Or we&#8217;re made to believe?</p>
<p>As many know now, Nokia is releasing an Android edition(s) in which I think is perhaps the WORST move towards us WP Devs. We&#8217;ve  done nothing but try to empower, fight, and promote the hell out of the platform to now be SLAPPED in the face? This is a joint slap by Nokia &#038; Microsoft.</p>
<p>Everyone who was outside of the ecosystem warned us the platform would weaken, die, or turn its back on us like Win Mobile era. It&#8217;s starting to feel true but a too familiar bad taste we have been fed before. Why trust Microsoft and the Nokia division now, they&#8217;re looking full speed ahead at Android.</p>
<p>Now the question for the future will always remain, why trust or build on Microsoft and now Nokia products? How long till they get bored or just plainly give up on the core audience who MADE the platform what it even is right nowadays, which could have been a LOT worse.</p>
<p>Ball is in your court now Microsoft/Nokia. Why do we bother with you or your services any more?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you use Microsoft Windows 8.1 Enterprise, Professional or N you may have noticed your Nokia Windows Phone 8 has likely not been able to be detected and therefore useless especially trying to build Enterprise Apps.</p>
<p>So, what does one do? We&#8217;ll, I searched far and wide for the right answer but NEVER found the answer. Some things claimed to work for people but they had a WP7 or using 32-Bit Processors. I happen to have a few machines, but still none of them answered my issue.</p>
<p><strong>WP/Windows Developers</strong></p>
<p>To get to the point, if you&#8217;re a developer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the latest Visual Studio<br />
* Ensure you check for Windows Phone support. Do not install any WP SDK&#8217;s.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-Developers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Download <a title="Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851" target="_blank">Microsoft .NET Framework 4</a>.x or later</li>
<li>Download the <a title="Windows Phone Sync" href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/A/4/8/A4885FE1-2D87-4E46-BB47-C2E109BFBB7C/WindowsPhone.exe" target="_blank">Windows Phone Sync App (in Store)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now you the non/developer have the basics, you need to install them and likely reboot your machine. You actually need to reboot (yes, I know its terrible). As you&#8217;ve come back from rebooting, hopefully you now have the Windows Standalone Update for: <a title="Windows Standalone Updater (KB2835517)" href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/D/F/9/DF92CB69-ABB8-4C81-9621-78A8E57531A3/Windows6.3-KB2835517-x64.msu" target="_blank">KB2835517</a>.</p>
<p>Before I have you install the file, open up your Device Manager (Windows Key + R, devmgmt.msc) and find your Nokia Lumia Device. It&#8217;s likely to have a yellow icon, but either way say the device name (RM-820) or something that makes it obvious. Now, Right-Click the device and Uninstall the Device but do <em><strong>NOT</strong></em> refresh the List as it&#8217;ll try to reinstall it but instead continue to the next step.</p>
<p>Go forth and open the file, run the installation and you&#8217;ll need to reboot once more, make sure you do NOT have your phone connected and when you&#8217;re fully loaded into Windows, open up your My Computer and plug your Nokia Lumia WP8 device in via USB and in moments you&#8217;ll see a Mobile Phone icon.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s ALL that&#8217;s required to start getting your Windows Phone working with your Windows 8.1 x64 Enterprise, Professional, N editions &amp; start programming or backing up your device.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As some know, the new PiCAST (2.0) is out and is now STABLE. This is my project that was aimed against Google originally as I was pretty upset with how they released and announced Chromecast. Get it at: <a title="Download PiCAST 2.0 from GitHub (Safe Link; New Window)" href="http://github.com/lanceseidman/picast" target="_blank">http://github.com/lanceseidman/picast</a>.</p>
<p>Why should I care? I am a consumer and the American way, to speak up and fight for injustice but also a techy who is very much progressive and feel Open Source anything can be beneficial for the future of any said product, service, or even government. But lets not get political, let us get to why the new PiCAST is better.</p>
<p>So in the new version, we took away the web technology like Apache, PHP, MySQL, and the constant complaints how it was &#8220;insecure&#8221; but the fact is, it was designed as a base model for developers to develop on top of, just like the Chromecast itself. However, as pairing was a thing &amp; more people wanted security, I went to Encrypted IP Tunneling to send &#8220;Casts&#8221; to the PiCAST as we now got rid of a LOT of those needed dependencies and the web aspect in general.</p>
<p>Now you we have Encrypted IP Tunneling, if you use the PiCAST Auto-Installer/Downloader you can set up the password within the install and life is grand. It will also do everything you need automatically (including dependencies) and selecting a user account to install to. This also sets up aliases for the system for BASH. Now you can type &#8220;pic&#8221; and tab to see what&#8217;s available in your release of PiCAST. Future installs/upgrades will look for this in the future and decide which edition you have as the project progresses.</p>
<p>As I have made it so now anyone can literally make his/her own add ons. It has become VERY easy, so I will make a small document soon to help people do it but to those who are intermediate developers will know just by seeing the process. Which brings me to why exactly SOME things should be OPEN SOURCE. This can help the future developers of the world, understand how things can be done to make them better, or maybe make a spin-off taking the process/protocols to do something even bigger or better.</p>
<p>Until PiCAST really gets an audience, I will make periodic updates to the project but hopefully others will take part as well. I don&#8217;t make anything money from the project, it&#8217;s just a passion project as I do have my own Chromecast but I want freedom to do what I want or NOT.You&#8217;re always welcome to give to the project using BitCoin (16b3QAFmjrh4yzHjLw7jAKG5AnV8WVXdCK) or you can use PayPal (lance@compulsivetech .biz) but funds will go to Opportunity Village that&#8217;s here in Las Vegas.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have had an IP hunt lately, trying to find where is my data going before the NSA gets it? It looks like Apple aka NSA of corporations may get a piece.</p>
<p>My phone IP was 166.137.209.17 aka mobile-166-137-209-017.mycingular.net. Now, if look this up, its registered to:</p>
<p>Service Provider Corporation<br />
73 Old Dublin Pike<br />
Doylestown, PA.</p>
<p>But, its part of AT&amp;T of St. Louis, MO. but what confuses me? My NSLOOKUP results:</p>
<p>Non-authoritative answer:<br />
17.209.137.166.in-addr.arpa name = mobile-166-137-209-017.mycingular.net.</p>
<pre>Now, who owns that IP (17.209.137.0 - 17.209.137.255), Apple, Inc.
 of course. To see a list of other IP's they own, visit:

http://myip.ms/view/ip_addresses/298944768/17.209.137.0_17.209.137.255.

Are they renting IP's or offering services where they can also
collect my data as a trade? I don't buy for a second they don't
somehow get some of my data. BUT if you know anything about
DNS's Non-authoritative just means my result isn't from my hosts
DNS Server but that's my concern.

Why is it that Apple is caching this and my own ISP isn't giving
the result? You can make the claim because of iPhone users &amp; Apple
spies on them. I say- true! Now, what are they doing storing it,
where are they getting it from, I can only imagine they're storing
it thanks to AT&amp;T.

You can call me crazy now, maybe the meds the ER gave me make me
more paranoid but in this police state, the real big brother is
corporations &amp; they spread its legs for big brother. In the end,
we're all getting fucked.</pre>

<p>As some close to me know, I make little electronics and always looking to make stuff that help people.</p>
<p>My hobby for the last year has been RC/Autonomous Drones. My subject? Originally the Raspberry Pi &amp; a 3D printed tricopter base with servo&#8217;s, gearbox motors, and a HP Motor.</p>
<p>Since August, I have used the Windows Phone, Nokia Lumia 920 to control the device as I did with my RC Car (source: http://github.com/lanceseidman). But I went one step further I removed the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>Yes, all my work for nothing!? Not quite. I decided my Lumia is literally a COMPUTER. It has built-in sensors, why not take that in to consideration? I did. It would mean, to just place a sturdy stand to embed on the device in which can control the motors/flight.</p>
<p>But as Nokia &amp; Microsoft neither support, know, or sponsor me&#8230; A broken phone means a broken phone &amp; $50 insurance claim for failures. But that doesn&#8217;t include when the parts pop off, things burn, etc. Maybe one day they&#8217;ll be interest</p>
<p>ed to sponsor it like Apple has with Sphero (well they sell it).</p>
<p>To the point? I did it. I used C#/.NET, JSONP, Httpclient/PostAsync, Lambda Functions, GPS, NFC (coming, chip coming soon), Camera/Video, &amp; Sockets. This allowed me when the Drone wasn&#8217;t near, to use my Mobile Data &amp; send to an Azure server w/Mobile Service &amp; SQL Blob capabilities.</p>
<p>BUT! If the device was in range (aka is Paired Device connected?) &amp; if it came back yes, I could use Bluetooth to control it. Even cooler? You can use your Windows Phone or Microsoft Surface or Nokia Tablet accelerometer to control it &amp; based on how much you tilted it would decide that and speed up or slow down in that direction OR shake to slow down &amp; just hover (soon big shakes will make it come back).</p>
<p>So, using Microsoft/Nokia technology, I have made a simple drone. You&#8217;ll be able to see it soon, follow me on Twitter &amp; if you look back you&#8217;ll see the Pi Drone pre-soldering.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As many are becoming rapidly aware, BitCoin is easily becoming recognizable as a possible Currency, cause really much like the USD, valuable only based on the belief that&#8217;s behind it.</p>
<p>You may have seen some small prototypes &#038; hardware shown to you on my G+ Feed or perhaps you got here on accident. Nonetheless, your continuity to read is intriguing every word in hopes that another BTC Wallet that is NOT the Trezor, a very over bought-in product that was originally 1BTC when it was $99 &#038; recently increased to about $650(?) till they stopped the pre-orders.</p>
<p>It would be one thing if they revised the price but of course they didn&#8217;t. So, you&#8217;d think maybe that&#8217;s why I set out to make my Wallet? Oddly, no but it has placed darkness in my thought process in wanting to make something for EVERYONE &#038; affordable as I could of course charge a hefty fee as the market is scarce.</p>
<p>That being said, my device will be as compact and ideally flexible as possible to make it thin and less likely to break but also light-weight and durable. Besides all of that? It must remain secure!</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t 100% gotten it to where I could sell BUT I am definitely with a working prototype but needs to be shrunken. So it will have a OLED (good for daylight &#038; sunlight reading), choice of Bluetooth or NFC, and certainly on the fly encryption.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to look for investors OR take it to Kickstarter. Hopefully a market exists and will agree, $30-$40 is a good price.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re in the Windows Phone (WP) community, especially if you&#8217;re a developer you hear how the big Apps don&#8217;t exist for the platform but today you&#8217;d be wrong again, BOB!</p>
<p>Some of us knew some of the Apps have been in the process of being created but sadly some have even been created for over 6 Months and just never published. But some new Apps to help make WP a true #3 Mobile Platform (at this rate, maybe #2 very soon as the platform outdoes Android &amp; iOS in foreign countries).</p>
<p>So what are some of the important Apps? Instagram (<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/instagram-beta/3222a126-7f20-4273-ab4a-161120b21aea">Download Instagram for Windows Phone</a>), Waze (<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/waze/f07f83eb-a8a4-49fd-8946-c67a9349e062">Download Waze for Windows Phone</a>), Vine (<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/vine/f9e6f07e-e47e-47f5-806d-55d4f79f2b60">Download Vine for Windows Phone</a>), and many other great titles like Pandora, Temple Run, and Xbox Game Titles (my favorite now is Uno &amp; Friends).</p>
<p>As an App Dev, this is great for the platform to help bring people over and encourages us to want to build more products as we&#8217;ll have a bigger audience or we hope.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what the future holds, but having 32 Apps under my belt for WP and developing since the beginning on this platform&#8230; I&#8217;m ready to keep building and bringing hardware to the platform (e.g. Like my RC Car, Breathalyzer, and Radio add-on for FM Radio).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2013/09/09/opensuse-arm-gets-new-raspberry-pi-images" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-655" alt="openSUSE" src="http://compulsivetech.biz/lance/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RPIopenSUSE-300x225.jpg" width="222" height="166" /></a>On Sept. 7th I was notified about a new OS for the Pi, as more and more ARM OS&#8217;s are being planned, was it true what I heard&#8230; SuSE, is it you&#8211; really?</p>
<p>Turns out Bernhard made the openSUSE Image and only 82MB Compressed (<a title="Download openSUSE Linux for Raspberry Pi" href="http://www.zq1.de/~bernhard/linux/opensuse/raspberrypi-opensuse-20130907.img.xz" target="_blank">Download Here</a>). He apparently already has a few tricks to speed the loading process, as he claims he can boot his pi up with openSUSE in about 55 Seconds, not bad at all!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to build on to the project or just make your own Image to burn to SD for your Pi, visit the original post at the <a title="openSUSE Blog - Raspberry Pi News" href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2013/09/07/new-raspberry-pi-image" target="_blank">openSUSE Linux Blog</a>. But the question<br />
remains, with a big OS name like the SuSE coming in, can this make other GNU/Linux Distros want to export to ARM, perhaps they see the Pi as a new source<br />
of getting said distro out and used?</p>
<p>We really won&#8217;t know for a while but when we do, we&#8217;ll likely know as we should see perhaps even bigger distro names as those who support the Pi seem to be a<br />
unique, talented, and ambitious crowd.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-648" alt="ROAHS" src="http://compulsivetech.biz/lance/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/logo-300x154.png" width="209" height="107" />If you haven&#8217;t been following me or on my Angelist page, Wearing Digital during getting the hardware created isn&#8217;t my main goal.</p>
<p>More and more the US Government in cities are shrinking, but mainly public services. This includes Firemen, Police, Paramedics, and so forth. Why is this a problem? Due to Global Warming or Climate Change (if you&#8217;re a dick), we see more flash floods, tornadoes and other natural disasters.</p>
<p>My new service Reach Out And Help Somebody (ROAHS) is to become the internet Emergency Service. One tap from our App, help has been sent to our API&#8217;s, Apps, Web CP, and also our Servicemen in local Gov who may be able to aid someone before dispatch can send them the lead.</p>
<p>Since you can be put on hold or wait up to 45 Mins for local servicemen to help, those around you who may be able to help, are on the way! Imagine web first and auto-dial 911 after.</p>
<p>I wish it didn&#8217;t have to be this way but we need another way to get help, when those in power defund those who can help and risk said life for another? Roahs will be the life saving tool I imagine it could be with the right funding.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an App Dev, maybe want to link or display maps for your local area even from your website? Join the private Beta!</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-641" alt="Spirit" src="http://compulsivetech.biz/lance/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/spiritwebsite.png" width="168" height="117" />Do you ever wish you could Tweet something and it eventually just leaves Twitter? We&#8217;ll, I personally don&#8217;t have a use for this but what if you&#8217;re running a campaign or contest&#8230;</p>
<p>Turns out an ex-engineer from Twitter decided to make Spirit, an App to drop your Tweet with just a Hashtag. Yes, just add #1m to Kaboom or #10m to even #30d. I am just<br />
wondering how many new concepts are going to come around these new possible hashtags, I just gave you #1m to Kaboom, so please don&#8217;t forget to send BitCoin payments my way.</p>
<p>The only issue I see, is Twitter themselves. They&#8217;re VERY strict on who gets to use the Twitter API if they become &#8220;popular&#8221; and Twitter does NOT like people using Twitter unless<br />
they control it. Which has everyone forgot, Twitter is where it is today because of Developers but of course they DUMPED us by restricting the API and putting crappy Ads (I get,<br />
you need to pay the bills) but to revoke such access and force GUI Guidelines? That&#8217;s exactly why the failed App.net didn&#8217;t succeed but created to compete against Twitter.</p>
<p>So, will Pierre Legrain (@pierrelegrain) feel the wrath from his ex-coworkers at Twitter OR is he working with Twitter to create new features in which will eventually be taken<br />
over by Twitter? Twitter has a good track record at buying companies who compete with them and/or use their API but don&#8217;t do what they want (aka most of the good Twitter<br />
Apps). All I know, is Twitter is a giant powerhouse and still in control of the micro-blog world.</p>
<p>Sign-up and start using Spirit Now, at <a title="Spirit for Twitter" href="http://twitterspirit.com" target="_blank">TwitterSpirit.com.</a></p>

<p>I was moving my mother from iOS to WP, so I gave her my new phone I was so proud of&#8230; Of course it wasn&#8217;t glitzy for her, so we got her a custom case &amp; blinged (hope this is right) it out, now she feels more classy than ever. But she asked me today, when I saw her that an Update was ready&#8230;</p>
<p>So, took her phone and sure enough, an update was ready and I wish I looked more carefully because it was several packages. As I updated her phone which took FOREVER, I went to take my non-Dev phone to update too, why not, right?<br />
Oops! Mine doesn&#8217;t have this new update! How can this be? I can only assume it&#8217;s because she has the Dev Phone. As both of our devices are synced to Microsoft services, I could wipe the phone and change SIM BUT I won&#8217;t, she gets to keep the &#8216;cool&#8217; phone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-624" alt="Yahoo!" src="http://compulsivetech.biz/lance/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/1378350662000-yahoo-logo-300x225.jpg" width="202" height="142" />If you&#8217;ve followed Yahoo! and the invasion of Mayer, greatness has come from the new CEO of once Google fame. But maybe ignore this Logo?</p>
<p>So, as link bait, Yahoo! thought to constantly put up new Logos which was far from being a real Logo as it was just fonts they went through, or it seemed&#8230; For 30 Days!</p>
<p>The new decided Logo which was recently revealed had me stumped, maybe I wasn&#8217;t looking at the NEW logo&#8230; Sadly, I was but barely noticed. However, according to Mayer, she took part in the &#8220;new design&#8221;.</p>
<p>As I love to hear her so hands on, I wish she would have kept silent as this new Logo isn&#8217;t anything to write home about let alone deserving of her somewhat transformed Yahoo! that she&#8217;s taken by the horns and playing like a game of chess&#8211; or with this stunt maybe checkers.</p>
<p>I did just look at her Tumblr (smart girl) to see what&#8217;s really going on and if we&#8217;ve been had but apparently some real thought went in to the process of making this new design that is now the official Yahoo! design. Will it stick or will some jerks on blogs (heh) or change.org demand it becomes illegal? Time will tell, probably sooner than later.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t feel any work went in to it? Don&#8217;t be quick to judge like I was, some time went in to it, so check out her post and online as well as the included video.</p>
