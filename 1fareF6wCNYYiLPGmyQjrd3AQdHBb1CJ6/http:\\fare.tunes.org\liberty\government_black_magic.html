This 33000 word essay
<a name="footnoteref1"></a
><a href="#footnote1"><sup><font size="-1">[1]</font
></sup
></a

develops the ideas that I presented
in the speech I gave on November 10<sup>th</sup
> 2002
at the
 <a href="http://www.libertarian.to/conventions/london01.htm">Liberty 2002 Conference</a
> organized in London by
the <a href="http://libertarian.co.uk">Libertarian Alliance</a
> and
the <a href="http://libertarian.to">Libertarian International</a
>.
The essential intuition
I had already exposed in articles previously published in French:
	<a href="http://fare.tunes.org/liberalisme/superstition_etatiste.html"><i>L'étatisme, forme moderne de la magie noire</i
></a
>
	(<a href="http://www.quebecoislibre.org/020831-2.htm">QL #108</a
>),
	and
	<a href="http://fare.tunes.org/liberalisme/magie_blanche_noire.html"><i>Magie blanche contre magie noire</i
></a
>
	(which latter article was since translated to English as
	<a href="http://fare.tunes.org/liberty/white_black_magic.html"><i>White Magic <i>vs</i
> Black Magic</i
></a
>).
However, the present essay is considerably expanded
as compared to the previous articles, and contains developments in
economics, psychology, philosophy, epistemology, sociology and ethics (pphew!).
Note that the slightly edited contents of section 2 of this essay
was published as an independent article:
	<a href="http://fare.tunes.org/liberty/public_goods_fallacies.html"><i>Public Goods Fallacies
			&mdash; False Justifications For Government</i
></a
>.
A previous version of this essay has been published
in the <a href="http://www.quebecoislibre.org/">Québécois Libre</a
> as a series of three articles:
<a href="http://www.quebecoislibre.org/030719-12.htm">Part One (QL #126)</a
>,
<a href="http://www.quebecoislibre.org/030816-12.htm">Part Two (QL #127)</a
>,
<a href="http://www.quebecoislibre.org/030913-12.htm">Part Three (QL #128)</a
>.
I also feel particularly honored that Christian Michel selected
this essay for publication on his website
	<a href="http://www.liberalia.com/">Liberalia.com</a
>
	(section <a href="http://www.liberalia.com/knowing.htm">Knowing</a

I since translated the essay to French:
	<a href="http://fare.tunes.org/liberalisme/regne_magie_noire.html"><i>L'État, règne de la magie noire</i
></a
>.
Subsequent speeches I made at
<a href="http://libertarian.to">Libertarian International</a

can be considered sequels to this one:

></font
><p align="justify">
Unless you visited <a href="http://fare.tunes.org/liberty/">my website</a

and consequently see what I mean
<a name="footnoteref2"></a

you are probably befuddled by the title of my essay:
``<i>Government is the Rule of Black Magic,
	On Human Sacrifices and Other Modern Superstitions</i
>´´.
You're wondering:
``is this guy some kind of looney? is he going to tell us that
government is not our real Enemy, but only the visible manifestation
of hidden forces of Evil that dominate our world through black magic?´´.
Well, yes I'm a looney, and yes this will be more or less my conclusion.
But my bet is that before you reach the end of this essay,
you will also be the very same kind of looney,
and you will agree with this conclusion.
Actually, since you're reading this page,
you probably already agree with me and just don't know it yet.
To convince you, I will only have to cast a new light on this Evil
the manifestations of which are all too familiar to you
<a name="footnoteref3"></a
><a href="#footnote3"><sup><font size="-1">[3]</font
></sup
></a
>.
</p
><a name="SUBSECTION_1.2"></a
><font size="+1" face="sans-serif"><b>1.2 The Question of Government</b
></font
><p align="justify">
But first things first.
If I am to tell you the intellectual trip that led me to this grim conclusion,
I might as well start from my point of departure.
The question that bugged me is a question that must bug most
rationally inclined libertarians at one point or another.
And most libertarian activists are probably the same kind
of rational cerebral libertarian as I am
(i.e. NT in the Myers-Briggs typology <a name="footnoteref4"></a
><a href="#footnote4"><sup><font size="-1">[4]</font
></sup
></a
>).
That question is:
are there any rational justifications to the existence of government?
What can we say of existing explanations that serve as official justifications?
In other words: is government the answer to the problems it claims to solve?
</p
><p align="justify">
Of course, the answer that we libertarians have reached is that
no, there are no rational justifications for government
<a name="footnoteref5"></a
><a href="#footnote5"><sup><font size="-1">[5]</font
></sup
></a
>,
its official explanations are bogus,
and not only does it not solve the problems it claims to solve,
but it creates these problems to begin with.
This answer even defines us as libertarians.
But this answer is not enough.
It is a mistake to close the debate there
and think that we've solved the problem
&mdash; just our knowing that government is wrong
won't in itself make government go away.
We must ask: if these explanations are fake,
then what is the <em>real</em
> reason
for people to believe in government?
What is the rational explanation for these irrational explanations
<a name="footnoteref6"></a
><a href="#footnote6"><sup><font size="-1">[6]</font
></sup
></a
>?
In other words:
if government is the answer,
then what was the question?
</p
><p align="justify">
That's how I'll uncover the dark secret of government.
Then, I'll develop the theme of black magic:
its principles;
the principles of white magic, its opposite;
how black magic manifests itself, etc.
I will conclude briefly with the task that lies ahead for us.

></table
><a name="SUBSECTION_2.1"></a
><font size="+1" face="sans-serif"><b>2.1 Public Goods</b
></font
><p align="justify">
The most popular tentative justification of government in rational terms
is Public Goods theory and its variants<a name="footnoteref7"></a
><a href="#footnote7"><sup><font size="-1">[7]</font
></sup
></a
>,
whether presented from a utilitarian point of view
(often with the help of its econometric toolbox),
or from a moral point of view:
some activity is of a special nature or has a special importance,
and therefore must be managed by a central agency
``in the interest of the public´´.
Without analyzing the details for the moment,
suffice it to say that
all other justifications of government somehow boil down
to a more particular or more general case of the Public Goods argument.
The ``public good´´ considered may be
some form of service related to security (police, justice, army),
infrastructure (transportation, telecommunications, education, health),
``harmonization´´ in some matter
(information, education, language, industry standards),
certification
(identity, land registry, verification of conformity to standards), etc.
</p
><p align="justify">
Unhappily, many libertarians concede some ``public goods´´ to the statists,
but then they are on a slippery slope, for there is no reason to
stop the public goods argument to any particular service.
To paraphrase Emile Faguet:
minarchists are libertarians who do not have the courage
to accept the full consequences of their ideas;
anarchists are uncompromising libertarians
<a name="footnoteref8"></a
><a href="#footnote8"><sup><font size="-1">[8]</font
></sup
></a
>.
Indeed, using arguments of the ``public goods´´ type,
government can intervene in just any domain &mdash;
and once it does, it will make sure that the domain is so messed up
that, by the same argument, it will have to extend its grasp over it
until the domain is both completely under its control and completely messed up
&mdash; and neighbouring domains in turn suffer.
But of course, intervention is based on the premise that government
intervention is useful, to begin with
&mdash; and this is precisely the point
that statists posit as a petition of principle;
it is precisely the point that needs to be disputed.
</p
><a name="SUBSECTION_2.2"></a
><font size="+1" face="sans-serif"><b>2.2 The <i>Ad Hoc</i
> Fallacy in Any Collectivism</b
></font
><p align="justify">
The arguments for the collectivization of some service
into a state-managed ``public good´´
contains an intrinsic <i>ad hoc</i
> fallacy:
Why pick any particular form of collectivization?
</p
><p align="justify">
Indeed, why collectivize or not collectivize, say, ``toilet paper´´?
Isn't there but a more specific need to collectivize
``green soft toilet paper in 5-inch-wide rolls
sold under a brand the name of which ends with an S´´?
(After all, some company may very well have a dangerous monopoly on these!)
Or why isn't there instead a need to collectivize production of all paper?
Why collectivize at the scale of Great Britain?
Why not collectivize at a smaller scale,
say Westminster or the block next door?
Or at a larger scale, say Northern Eurasia, or our quadrant of the Milky Way?
And why collectivize it on a geographical scale at all?
Why not collectivize for people whose name begin with an ``R´´,
or for people who wear black socks?
</p
><p align="justify">
As for arbitrarily choosing the scale,
we could as well argue that the considered services
are of such a particular nature or importance for an <em>individual</em
>
that he shouldn't be deprived from
his own ability to choose without being coerced, as an independent individual,
how these services should be provided to him.
Or if we are to take the opposite view, why stop?
If collectivization of the considered service is of such an importance
that the necessity for everyone to obey the same orders
is an <em>absolute</em
> priority that justifies coercion and violence
until everyone agrees,
then we should stop all other activities, withhold all human rights
and wage world war until there is a world government so
that at last <em>everyone</em
> will be under the same rule.
And why stop there even?
Before we have any respect for individual rights,
it is also urgent to send space ships to conquer the universe
and compel space aliens into accepting
the same social laws as we have.
</p
><p align="justify">
Collectivists implicitly accept that their argument is not universal:
their claim verily supposes the existence of
an important counter-effect that becomes preponderant
and limits the applicability of their argument.
What are these counter-effects, their relevance, their limits?
Only by identifying and studying these counter-effects
can the possible applicability of their argument be established.
In other words, their claim contains its very own contradiction,
which they dismiss by voluntary ignorance.
Their call for governmental coercion is based
on a one-sided view of government.
This is the case of all statist justifications

></font
><p align="justify">
Here is a brief review of the justifications given by statists
to argue for the necessity or utility of government.
Other arguments for ``public goods´´
can be found to be fallacies as well
<a name="footnoteref10"></a
><a href="#footnote10"><sup><font size="-1">[10]</font
></sup
></a
>.
See footnotes for details.
<ul><li>
The Externalities Theory of ``public goods´´
states that some activities
intrinsically imply <em>externalities</em
>
<a name="footnoteref11"></a
><a href="#footnote11"><sup><font size="-1">[11]</font
></sup
></a
>,
and that government is a magic solution to managing these externalities,
&mdash;
whereas it is but a way to coercively concentrate externalities,
from lots of small, manageable ones,
into the huge and overwhelming externality
of ensuring there is a ``good´´ government,
which turns out to be completely unmanageable
<a name="footnoteref12"></a
><a href="#footnote12"><sup><font size="-1">[12]</font
></sup
></a
>.</li
><li>
The Game Theory version of ``public goods´´
similarly considers government as an external all-knowing benevolent God,
that will help people choose the average best scenario
in interactions modelled after simple mathematical ``games´´,
&mdash;
whereas the government is actually made of people with their own self-interest,
so that if we are to <em>correctly</em
> use Game Theory,
we must consider government officials
as self-interested players among others;
the only particular characteristic of political action is
that government agents have the power of legal coercion,
which in Game Theory translates into
their being able to impose to their own benefit
negative-sum games of their choice
<a name="footnoteref13"></a
><a href="#footnote13"><sup><font size="-1">[13]</font
></sup
></a
>.
</li
><li>
With the Impossibility To Exclude and Impossibility to Divide theories,
many economists define ``public goods´´
as goods from which the exclusion of third parties is allegedly impossible,
or the division of which into individual shares is impossible.
They then introduce the notion that government
is a magic solution to manage these goods
and has a ``natural monopoly´´ on those goods.
This ``natural monopoly´´ of course is nothing else
than the allegedly impossible exclusion
of people who will not fit government-established rules,
and the allocation of shares
of the allegedly ``indivisible´´ common good
according to the government-imposed criteria
<a name="footnoteref14"></a
><a href="#footnote14"><sup><font size="-1">[14]</font
></sup
></a
>.
</li
><li>
The Catastrophe-Prevention version of ``public good´´
agitates the straw man of a simultaneous failure
of all suppliers of some service
to justify government intervention in the market of said service.
Now, the <em>only</em
> way that there could be
a catastrophic simultaneous failure of all suppliers of said service
is that there be a single simultaneous management of all supplies
by a <i>de jure</i
> monopoly &mdash;
which is precisely what government <em>introduces</em
>
<a name="footnoteref15"></a
><a href="#footnote15"><sup><font size="-1">[15]</font
></sup
></a
>.
</li
><li>
Collective will theories,
whether the democratic version of ``Will of the People´´,
the nationalist version about ``Identity of the Nation´´,
or the socialist version about the ``Good of Society´´,
go on to suppose that individuals must be coerced into
joining a particular utopia.
The utopia is assumed to be good <em>in theory</em
>,
because people willingly adhere to it;
yet at the same time,
it is admitted <em>in practice</em
> that
people do not willingly adhere to said utopia,
since they must be coerced into adhering to it
<a name="footnoteref16"></a
><a href="#footnote16"><sup><font size="-1">[16]</font
></sup
></a
>.</li
><li>
The Broken Window Fallacy supposes that
there are some goods, ``public goods´´,
that government can create out of the blue
by its own sacred power of coercion.
Of course, when individuals not blessed by this sacred power
dare to do the same destructive and freedom-infringing things
as government does to ``create´´ those goods,
they are immediately spotted as criminals and treated as such
&mdash; and rightly so
<a name="footnoteref17"></a
><a href="#footnote17"><sup><font size="-1">[17]</font
></sup
></a
>.</li
><li>
The Moral Fallacy supposes that man is too evil (or too ``something´´)
to govern himself regarding some ``public goods´´
that must thus be confided to the government
&mdash; but the government itself is made of men
who are not less evil (or less ``something´´) than the rest of mankind.
Government is not determined by an external superior force,
but by men among others.
Actually, its coercive power is of a corrupting nature
that will make government officials evil rather than good,
both by changing those who embrace it
and by selecting those who seek it
<a name="footnoteref18"></a
><a href="#footnote18"><sup><font size="-1">[18]</font
></sup
></a
>.</li
><li>
The Altruist Fallacy is a particular misconception often used
together with the Moral Fallacy, to justify the necessity of government:
it affirms that people are naturally egoistic,
and that there needs be an external force to make them
behave in altruistic ways in spite of themselves, so that they may survive.
This fallacy once again supposes that government
is moved by an external force outside of the public,
whereby statesmen and their henchmen would be
more altruistic and less egoistic than the citizens.
But it also supposes that altruism is in opposition with egoism
&mdash; which is false.
And which is so obviously false,
that it is by appeal to people's egoist interest
that the self-proclaimed altruists
try to convince people to follow them in their statist schemes
<a name="footnoteref19"></a
><a href="#footnote19"><sup><font size="-1">[19]</font
></sup
></a
>.</li
><li>
The ``Long Term Interest´´ Fallacy combines
the Moral Fallacy with the Catastrophe-Prevention Fallacy:
it supposes that only government can take into account
the long-term interests of people.
Now, only people with property rights truly secured on the long term
can and will commit to coherent long-term investments.
However, governments are never secure in their remaining in power,
unless they may use extreme oppression,
which both makes obvious their lack of benevolence
and spends the resources necessary for long-term investment
<a name="footnoteref20"></a
><a href="#footnote20"><sup><font size="-1">[20]</font
></sup
></a
>.</li
><li>
The Uniformity Fallacy assumes that
uniformity in some matters is good in itself,
and is a ``public good´´ such that
common government regulations over as large a territory as possible
is the only or best way to achieve the desired uniformity in these matters.
However, uniformity is not always good in itself;
coercion by governments is neither the only way nor the best way
to enforce standards;
moreover the domains that standards will optimally regulate
are seldom either large or territorial;
and most importantly, a system of coercion
hampers the very <em>discovery</em
>
of which better standards should be commonly adopted and enforced,
because it destroys the points of comparison,
neglects most opinions save that of the authority and its lobbyists,
and prevents dynamic adjustment
to varying and evolving individual circumstances

></font

It is one thing to know that statist arguments are logical fallacies,
but it is quite another thing to understand why and how these fallacies arise.
What are the mechanisms of thought that lead to developing
this kind of beliefs and this kind of justifications?
How come so many people take it for granted
that government can magically solve any and all  problems
that they fear or encounter?
</p
><p align="justify">
A common way to answer these questions
is to analyze the popularity of these fallacious opinions
in terms of the interests
of the people who spread them and who accept them
<a name="footnoteref22"></a
><a href="#footnote22"><sup><font size="-1">[22]</font
></sup
></a
>.
From this perspective,
these people will better prosper who spread or accept opinions
from the respective popularity or displayed acceptance of which
they derive higher marginal benefits and lower marginal costs
<a name="footnoteref23"></a
><a href="#footnote23"><sup><font size="-1">[23]</font
></sup
></a
>.
This point of view has been successfully used
to develop Public Choice Theory,
that explains the underlying mechanisms of political decision in democracies.
It is a very important tool to understand
the strength of the forces that underlie political oppression and plunder
throughout the world.
</p
><p align="justify">
These forces are such that any time there is a potential for exploitation,
someone will come and use this potential to his profit.
And the potential in this case
is the acceptance by people of their being exploited
<a name="footnoteref24"></a
><a href="#footnote24"><sup><font size="-1">[24]</font
></sup
></a
>:
any time people have beliefs that make them willing to be exploited,
then political entrepreneurs will rush
to turn this opportunity into actual exploitation.
Note that this is another reason why government subsidies are never useful
and can always be counted as almost pure consumption:
because any promise of potential exploitation
generates lobbying toward collecting (and keeping) the subsidies,
up to the amount when the marginal gain (subsidy minus lobbying cost)
equals the marginal return on investment in other industries
<a name="footnoteref25"></a
><a href="#footnote25"><sup><font size="-1">[25]</font
></sup
></a
>.
People specializing in ``political entrepreneurship´´
will discover or create new untapped resources
that they will exploit,
all the while preserving and intensifying
the existing exploitation
<a name="footnoteref26"></a
><a href="#footnote26"><sup><font size="-1">[26]</font
></sup
></a
>.
</p
><p align="justify">
The conclusion of this analysis is that
the battle for freedom is not a battle between people,
it is a battle between ideas.
In as much as the ideas that currently allow for exploitation to exist
are in widespread acceptance,
the actual potential for oppression remains just as strong,
and fighting current oppressors and abolishing current forms of oppression
will only lead to different oppressors taking control
and instituting new forms of oppression.
It is the voluntary servitude, as La Boétie called it,
the acceptance of power, that must be fought.
</p

Now, as far as suggesting ways to fight fallacies,
this approach does not offer very encouraging answers;
it certainly gives general recipes for how to lobby or not to lobby,
but such advice is worthy whether you're lobbying for or against liberty,
and it seems that the enemies of liberty
already have a headlong advance at levying such techniques
<a name="footnoteref27"></a
><a href="#footnote27"><sup><font size="-1">[27]</font
></sup
></a
>.
If we are to go further and actually fight these fallacies,
if we are to choose actions that will better the statist propaganda,
then we have to take an approach that is qualitative
rather than merely quantitative.
Why are <em>these</em
> fallacies surviving,
rather than other fallacies?
If these fallacies were successfully dispelled,
would exploitation be vanquished,
or would the interests at stake just spawn different fallacies to replace them,
with exploitation remaining just as intensive?
Is there something in these fallacies that can be traced
as the Evil to be struck,
rather than the superficial shapes
that it can replace at will when they are defeated?
To find out, we must analyze the common patterns of thought
behind the fallacies used to justify government.
</p
><a name="SUBSECTION_3.2"></a
><font size="+1" face="sans-serif"><b>3.2 Patterns In Irrationality</b
></font
><p align="justify">
A first obvious common point in all the justifications for government:
they all suppose that government somehow provides
some kind of goods for free, without any costly counterpart.
The existence of this pattern among statists is not anything new;
we libertarians even have a mantra to dispel this pattern:
TANSTAAFL
<a name="footnoteref28"></a
><a href="#footnote28"><sup><font size="-1">[28]</font
></sup
></a
>.
However, what is remarkable is that <em>all</em
> statist justifications
include this pattern, albeit sometimes in a less than obvious way.
The pattern is most visible in the trivial cases,
where the goods to be provided for free are the subsidies
that are not compared to the corresponding taxes.
In more subtle cases, the pattern is hidden
behind the increased complexity of the situation,
but it's still there:
for instance, government is supposed to
bring the coordination of people toward some common good for free.
Ultimately, what government is supposed to bring
is some kind of a warranty that evil won't happen;
some special sense of security.
But in all cases, government is supposed
to conjure something out of thin air
<a name="footnoteref29"></a
><a href="#footnote29"><sup><font size="-1">[29]</font
></sup
></a
>:
The only thing supposedly required for government to grant us its blessings
is to demand them by petitioning it with enough faith.
</p
><p align="justify">
A second pattern that can be found to accompany the first pattern
is that government is seen as an external entity,
something outside of society and above it.
And this divine nature is precisely what allows it
to create and dispense goods, services, trust or whatever, at no cost.
This divine nature can be put clearly in evidence
through the <em>awe</em
> of people before the visible power of the State:
``how could mere individuals accomplish that?´´ will they wonder,
when it is suggested that a government monopoly
on this or that activity should be abolished.
Yet, government monopoly or no government monopoly,
it is always ``mere´´ individuals doing things!
Of course it is, and it cannot be otherwise.
Politicians and government officers are not more than other individuals;
actually, experience as well as theory shows that they are usually
<em>less</em
> than other individuals &mdash; because they are irresponsible.
Government doesn't sprinkle any pixie dust on its masters and servants,
it doesn't endow them with any magic power.
Actually, Government <em>does</em
> grant them a special ability
that normal individuals don't have &mdash;
and this ability is indeed what characterizes Government:
it is the ability to recourse to legal coercion
against those who refuse to obey.
The God that statists worship is Brute Force.
So, translated in real terms, without the veil of magic,
the question that those awed people wonder about really is:
``how could this be achieved without coercion?´´
And the answer is then obviously ``with less suffering´´

<a name="footnoteref30"></a
><a href="#footnote30"><sup><font size="-1">[30]</font
></sup
></a
>.
</p
><p align="justify">
As we progress toward the dark secret behind statism,
we find a third common pattern among justifications for government:
they all introduce a false tradeoff between liberty and some good,
where government is supposed to be the divine entity with which trade happens.
Divine, because it is clear to everyone, including the statists,
that no human force could propose such a deal
<a name="footnoteref31"></a
><a href="#footnote31"><sup><font size="-1">[31]</font
></sup
></a
>.
But statists either ignore human behavior,
or classify the State out of it
&mdash; to them, Government is a God,
a superior collectivist entity with which to trade.
(Where's my invoice
<a name="footnoteref32"></a
><a href="#footnote32"><sup><font size="-1">[32]</font
></sup
></a
>?)
The way they evade the crucial question:
``Who warranties the warrant
<a name="footnoteref33"></a
><a href="#footnote33"><sup><font size="-1">[33]</font
></sup
></a
>?´´
is by pushing it back behind a veil of ignorance and blind faith.
Once again, some supernatural force is meant
to create trust out of nowhere, for free.
Magic mantras, sacred texts with magic power,
such as constitutions
<a name="footnoteref34"></a
><a href="#footnote34"><sup><font size="-1">[34]</font
></sup
></a
>,
the complex rituals and formal apparatus of the State and its administration,
all contribute to lure people into attributing a divine aura to the State.
</p
><p align="justify">
Finally, a common point between all of these fallacies is that
all their arguments contain dynamically self-destructing notions.
That is, they imply the dynamic opposite of the axioms used to justify them.
They rely on premises the effects of which
lead to the quick disappearance of the premises.
This particular kind of contradiction shows
that underlying these fallacies is
a way of thinking that ignores the dynamics of human action through causation
and focuses on static assessments about society using correlations.
Such dynamic contradictions are based on
	some kind of static reasoning
	that ignores the very basics of dynamic human behavior
	&mdash; that ignores the very nature of man.
This makes it paradoxical
	that statists often accuse libertarians
	of being utopian and unrealistic
	and ignorant of human nature,
	whereas it is precisely the statists
	who deserve such comments!
But this kind of paradox is frequent with statists.
</p
><p align="justify">
All in all, the justifications for statism
are not a collection of isolated mistakes;
they stem from a systematic line of flawed reasoning,
from a strong paradigm, from a view of the world.
</p
><a name="SUBSECTION_3.3"></a
><font size="+1" face="sans-serif"><b>3.3 Government: The Unofficial Justification</b
></font
><p align="justify">
From our study of them, it appears that
all the justifications of the State ultimately boil down to this:
<em>
religious worship of the State as an almighty supernatural authority.
</em
>
The State is the idol of a self-denying pagan cult.
Belief in such nonsense would be considered a mental disease,
if it were not so common.
And hopefully, in a not so far away future,
it will indeed be considered as a mental pandemic,
an infantile disease that swept away the world
at a time when mankind is still very young.
However, for the time being,
it is still up to us to devise a cure
&mdash; and to be able to do so, we must first understand the disease,
how it survives, how it propagates.
We must investigate the psychological mechanisms
underlying such a belief system,
identify the weaknesses of the mind
through which this parasite belief enters people's mind.
</p
><p align="justify">
Governments are assuming undue authority.
Thus, in as much as the structure of human feelings
is a common genetic heritage,
any strong and coherent tendency in a lot of people
to believe in government has an explanation in terms
of the usurpation of some natural sentiment of submission to authority.
Natural sources of authority are not many:
parents have some authority on their children,
in as much as they provide for them;
friends give their opinions to be taken into account
in as much as their alliance is to be preserved;
chiefs lead people in short times of emergency
(war, fire, natural disaster, etc.);
elders or great achievers have authority on laymen,
in as much as their wisdom is acknowledged.
In evolutionary time scales, these are probably as much complexity
as could make way into the innate structure of the human mind
<a name="footnoteref35"></a
><a href="#footnote35"><sup><font size="-1">[35]</font
></sup
></a
>.
</p
><p align="justify">
The first kind of natural authority in human life is parenting.
And the fallacies used as justification for government
are fallacies of parenting indeed
&mdash; they ride on the primitive mental mechanisms
by which young infants relate to their parents.
To a young child, the parents appear as
external superior entities that give one goods for free,
if only one moans and cries,
without one having to think about the ins and outs
of the production of the goods thus bestowed.
Parents are understood as well-meaning,
having with their children a relationship of mutual love;
young infants have an absolute trust in their parents
<a name="footnoteref36"></a
><a href="#footnote36"><sup><font size="-1">[36]</font
></sup
></a
>.
Finally, it is almost universally accepted that parents have
an authority to decide for their children,
and even to punish them in certain cases &mdash;
though the precise limits of parental authority are debatable
<a name="footnoteref37"></a
><a href="#footnote37"><sup><font size="-1">[37]</font
></sup
></a
>.
</p
><p align="justify">
There is no doubt that governments pretend to assume the role of parents.
In autocracies of all times, the personal tyrant has always posed as
Father of the Nation <a name="footnoteref38"></a
><a href="#footnote38"><sup><font size="-1">[38]</font
></sup
></a
>,
Big Brother, or something similar
<a name="footnoteref39"></a
><a href="#footnote39"><sup><font size="-1">[39]</font
></sup
></a
>.
In countries where power is more diluted,
no single statesman might dare claim such a pompous title
&mdash; though it is not uncommon that powerful and lasting politicians
be given by journalists both flattering and joking
a surname of the same vein <a name="footnoteref40"></a
><a href="#footnote40"><sup><font size="-1">[40]</font
></sup
></a
>;
but even in these countries,
government as a whole nonetheless
claims the role and powers devolved to parental care:
the mythology of government as a parent,
or of the Nation as a parent of which government is the spokesman
is still very present in the public discourse about government.
This is revealed by the ease with which are generated and accepted
such common symbols as <i>Uncle Sam</i
>
or the motherly personification of various nations.
And it is not uncommon, when discussing with statists,
that they will explicitly appeal to the notion that government
fulfills the role of parent with respect to citizens,
who are maintained within the role of irresponsible children.
</p
><p align="justify">
Now, the statist disease doesn't just substitute government for parents:
it attempts to confer government authority from all possible sources.
Democracy, the concept of Nation, and the notion of ``Social Contract´´,
are tricks for the State to assume the authority
of a voluntary alliance of friends,
although there lacks the basic premise
that would give validity and a friendly nature to such an alliance,
namely its voluntary nature, &mdash; in other words,
the liberty to enter it or refrain from entering it, and even exit it.
Governments assume the role of a chief in times of emergency.
They begin by excluding any competition;
then they reinforce their power by creating a permanent climate of emergency.
The failings of governments are thus instrumental to their self-preservation,
by prolonging and extending the emergency that governments are meant to solve.
Finally, governments, through the heavy subsidy
of whichever alleged ``scientists´´, ``artists´´ and ``experts´´
support their authority,
thereby claim the endorsement of human wisdom for their edicts.
</p
><p align="justify">
Even if all these roles were legitimately assumed,
they wouldn't endow governments with any of the political rights they claim:
to enslave citizens and non-citizens part-time,
to rob and imprison those who won't cooperate,
to kill and torture those who resist
&mdash; and most importantly, to make laws.
Law-making is the godly power to unilaterally define and redefine the rules
that relate governments to people under their dominion,
and that relate these people to each other.
Parents, friends, wise men, and even chiefs,
have none of these prerogatives
upon those who voluntarily accept their authorities,
not to talk about those who decline their authorities.
Through all these tricks of emotional fraud,
governments are really trying to impersonate God
&mdash; the supreme authority
<a name="footnoteref41"></a
><a href="#footnote41"><sup><font size="-1">[41]</font
></sup
></a
>.
</p
><p align="justify">
So as to achieve its emotional and intellectual fraud,
the statist meme <a name="footnoteref42"></a
><a href="#footnote42"><sup><font size="-1">[42]</font
></sup
></a
>
does much more than just divert
existing emotions from their rightful targets:
it severely distorts the way infected people view the world,
to begin with.
It must bypass the natural defense system of the human mind,
its immunity system: reason, the bullshit detector.
And it must take constantly renewed measures
to keep this defense system disabled as far as it is concerned
<a name="footnoteref43"></a
><a href="#footnote43"><sup><font size="-1">[43]</font
></sup
></a
>.
Yet at the same time,
it cannot simply destroy all human understanding,
otherwise infected humans would not survive long enough to be infected
and propagate the meme
<a name="footnoteref44"></a
><a href="#footnote44"><sup><font size="-1">[44]</font
></sup
></a
>.
The successful parasite must selectively destroy understanding;
it must condition the application of its fallacious content
so it doesn't prevent basic surviving skills;
it must leave enough of the mind alive and well
so as to nurture and transmit the illness
<a name="footnoteref45"></a
><a href="#footnote45"><sup><font size="-1">[45]</font
></sup
></a
>.
</p
><p align="justify">
This circumvention and selective destruction of the immunity system
is the essence of the statist disease, as of all diseases.
It is the fundamental point about the statist disease,
the source that enables all errors.
It is the flaw through which the disease can invade
the whole of a human's understanding of society and the universe.
It is the cause that fatally leads to terrible consequences.
It is the cornerstone to all intellectual and emotional frauds;
it is the key that justifies all massive criminal behavior.
Only by identifying this flaw can we build new defenses and find a cure.
Therefore, we must study more deeply
the immunity-altering mechanism of this mental disease;
we must fully analyze the ur-Evil
of this statist meme that infects human minds.
And to begin with, we must give this Evil its name:
<em>Black Magic</em

Like all diseases, Black Magic can be characterized by its symptoms.
We find a fine, precise and concise summary of these symptoms in an
entry of <a href="http://www.alcyone.com/max/lit/devils/"><i>The Devil's Dictionary</i
></a

<blockquote>
Pray, <i>v.</i

</p
><p align="justify">
Black Magic is best evidenced by contrasting it
with the opposite attitude of White Magic,
that is adopted by sane minds
<a name="footnoteref46"></a
><a href="#footnote46"><sup><font size="-1">[46]</font
></sup
></a
>.
</p
><p align="justify">
Everyone seeks happiness, success or redemption;
but we can distinguish two radically opposite path to follow
while striving for them.
A follower of Black Magic
begs for grants,
he humiliates himself,
submits to superior forces.
An observer of White Magic
earns rewards,
he develops self-pride and mastership of nature (in a non-hierarchical sense).
A follower of Black Magic
tries to obtain favors from superior forces
by making sacrifices,
by destroying things or people,
by making a show of one's friendly intents,
or even by humiliating himself in groveling submission.
An observer of White Magic
tries to obtain satisfactions from earthly things and people
(in a non-hierarchical relation
<a name="footnoteref47"></a
><a href="#footnote47"><sup><font size="-1">[47]</font
></sup
></a
>),
by enhancing himself and his property,
by creating goods and services,
by doing actual work,
by proudly developing his skills.
Followers of Black Magic are ignorant of nature and how it works,
and they rebel against it when it doesn't satisfy their whims.
Practitioners of White Magic try to understand nature and its mechanisms,
they accept it as it is,
and use their knowledge of it to achieve satisfactions.
To followers of Black Magic, Gods are supernatural beings above us;
their nature is Holy and suffers no questioning.
To practitioners of White Magic,
in as much as things can be explained in terms of Gods,
Gods are but aspects of Nature itself.
To followers of Black Magic, the ultimate goal is
the fulfillment of all wild desires,
with impossibility being vanquished in a surreal paradise
to be granted to worshippers in some far future or after death.
To practitioners of White Magic, the ultimate goal is
to achieve appreciated satisfactions before death,
with the wisdom to reevaluate one's desires
so as to fit the realm of the possible.
</p
><p align="justify">
This is what I call Black Magic &mdash;
the belief and practice of seeking good things as
miracles bestowed by a certain kind of jealous and venal Gods:
Gods who require you to humiliate yourself before them;
Gods who reward sacrifices that prove subservience;
Gods who relish the abjection of their believers,
	and the reduction of unbelievers into subjects;
Gods who rejoice from the destruction or debasement
	of oneself and other people;
Gods with unlimited powers and arbitrary whims,
	that are not bound by any law knowable by reason,
	but are meant to be influenced by
	a display of compliant intentions from their humiliated followers.
Of course, awful gods who could be corrupted by such an attitude
	would not deserve being worshipped at all.
They are monstruosities against which
	any self-respecting human being can but revolt.
Those that grovel at the feet of such gods
	are slaves, swine;
	they are creatures lacking the dignity of their own free will,
	and they are prompt to forsake their free will indeed.
</p
><p align="justify">
On the contrary, White Magic is a wholly different set of beliefs,
involving a wholly different kind of incorruptible but well-meaning Gods:
	Gods who require people to improve themselves;
	Gods who reward the creations that proves one's mastership
		with the creations themselves;
	Gods who relish from the self-esteem of believers,
		and the raise of unbelievers into partners;
	Gods who rejoice at their observers' self-reliance and pride;
	Gods who have limited power,
		whose behavior is circumscribed
		by knowable laws of nature,
		who are only moved by appropriate engineering
		by proud observers.
These Gods are not to be worshipped, but understood.
They are facts of nature that humans must learn to know and accept.
Those who master these Gods become better humans;
	they are moral beings exerting their morality by making choices,
	and who indeed seek liberty and its dual face, responsibility,
	as the mother of all virtues.
</p
><a name="SUBSECTION_4.2"></a
><font size="+1" face="sans-serif"><b>4.2 The Magic Color Of Life</b
></font
><p align="justify">
Black Magic and White Magic are two opposite poles
in the universe of attitudes that humans can have toward Life.
In actual human behavior, in actual human beliefs, religions and discourses,
within the complexity of any single person's mind,
the two opposite attitudes may be simultaneously present,
and their many instances interwoven, combined, and blended.
The reality of human behavior oscillates between these two extremes,
and more often than not yield shades of gray.
But this gray doesn't mean that black and white do not exist:
the very notion of shades of gray presupposes
that black and white exist,
that they can be separated
and that you can be closer to one than to the other.
</p
><p align="justify">
Separating white from black is not easy.
Indeed, both aspects are simultaneously present
in traditional cultures and religions;
the very same words will contain several meanings
with radically different colors;
and most people will conflate these meanings
into a vague confuse concept
that prevents them from distinguishing the opposition between those meanings.
Thus, confused or deceiving people
will often resort to patterns of thoughts
that jump from one meaning to the other
without most listeners noticing the mistake or fraud.
And this permanent confusion is no sheer bad luck:
Black Magic systematically develops deceitful appearances:
it will impersonate white magic
so as to claim its creations,
and thus to usurp power and legitimacy.
Black magicians, the great destructors who dominate society,
will dress in white, and claim to be great creators,
whereas they will dress in black
the enslaved white magicians who actually create.
</p
><p align="justify">
Thus, people who believe what they are taught by schools and mass media
will often have an inverted idea
of what is white magic and what is black magic,
of who is being exploited and who is exploiting,
of what are the principles of creation,
and what are the principles of destruction.
The more gullible people will indeed
invert black and white on a wide area of issues,
wherever the official propaganda is efficient.
Less gullible people will be confused into seeing gray everywhere.
Of course, people find it usually obvious
to distinguish what is constructive and what is destructive
when it concerns themselves directly,
so that the black magic propaganda can seldom deceive people
regarding their immediate self-interest;
but it can deceive them regarding their long-term self-interest,
and regarding the self-interest of those people they don't know well.
It inverts the long-range moral vision of gullible people,
and induces moral myopia in less gullible people.
This inversion causes a lot of confusion;
it creates for each believer an intermediate area
where everything is blurry or self-contradictory,
between their correct short-range understanding
and their inverted long-range understanding;
this in turn induces a feeling of absurdity about life.
In the end, this leads to a form of schizophrenia
among those who accept theories too far from everyday practice
<a name="footnoteref48"></a
><a href="#footnote48"><sup><font size="-1">[48]</font
></sup
></a
>,
to self-destruction by those
who will not adopt practices opposite to their theories;
and to atrophy of the minds of those who seek to avoid mental conflict
by rejecting theory altogether.
</p
><p align="justify">
So as to understand the world,
we must learn thus to untangle the tree of white magic
from the parasite lianes of black magic that surround it.
So as to assess the effects of various attitudes and deeds,
we must examine the respective influences
of Black Magic and White Magic in human behavior.
Black magic always wins in appearance;
you will always see it dominate the established institutions,
glorified by formal rites and astonishing shows.
But it is white magic that actually makes the world go round,
even if it requires discernment to see that.
Black magicians are expert in wishful thinking,
idle imprecation, and deception of themselves and other people;
but only through the dedicated work of white magicians
does the world actually progress.
All creation stems from the principles of white magic.
White magic serves as the basis for civilization itself.
And Black Magic itself can survive but as a parasite to White Magic,
&mdash; for if there is no creation, there soon remains nothing left to destroy.

White Magic and Black Magic attitudes are pervasive.
Indeed, it is by structuring the way people think
that they influence the way people act.
Like all self-reproducing memes,

they spread and survive in as much as
the act they entail will in turn contribute to spreading the meme.
A major target for the memes is thus
the center of language,
the mechanisms with which individuals
associate meaning to words
and relate words to each other and to emotions,
the way people understand the world.

<a href="http://www.orwell.ru">George Orwell</a
>,
in his famous novel
<a href="http://orwell.ru/library/novels/1984/index.htm"><i>1984</i
></a
>,
described how totalitarian regimes
try to limit the way people can think, express and exchange
ideas that may be subversive to their established order,
by reshaping the language into what he dubs <i>novlang</i
>:
the vocabulary is reduced;
the terms are redefined to mean only what the party wants;
and to have the connotations in line to the party ideology;
the subversive words and meanings are eliminated, etc.
<a name="footnoteref49"></a
><a href="#footnote49"><sup><font size="-1">[49]</font
></sup
></a
>
When the enemies of liberty do not hold totalitarian power,
they cannot manipulate the language at will;
however, they can still spread their connotations into words,
and add enough secondary meanings to existing words
so as to render them useless (or at least much less useful)
at conveying opposing ideas, or precise ideas at all.
Indeed, Friedrich Hayek has observed how the adjective ``social´´,
when a prefix to such terms as
``justice´´, ``contract´´, ``responsibility´´, etc.,
was actually used to have justice, contract, responsibility, etc.,
mean the opposite to what libertarians would use these words for.
Philosophers like Henry Hazlitt or Ayn Rand have also observed
how the words ``egoism´´ and ``altruism´´ were being used
by enemies of liberty with grossly incoherent meanings,
promoting them as incompatible and opposite to one another,
with egoism being evil and altruism being good,
thus justifying the sacrifice of individuals to the collectivity,
as incarnate in its government
<a name="footnoteref50"></a
><a href="#footnote50"><sup><font size="-1">[50]</font
></sup
></a
>.
</p
><p align="justify">
We may pinpoint a case where Black Magicians have strongly biased a word
in our preceding comparative table: the word ``exploitation´´.
Exploitation means fulfilling some potential of usefulness;
bringing the good out of something or someone.
So mutual exploitation is something quite <em>good</em
>,
that allows everyone to be better off,
with a net result of creation of wealth for everyone
&mdash; mutual exploitation is the root of everything good in society
<a name="footnoteref51"></a
><a href="#footnote51"><sup><font size="-1">[51]</font
></sup
></a
>.
But the black magicians have loaded the word ``exploitation´´
to specifically means unilateral exploitation of one
to the benefit of the other, with a net result of destruction of wealth.
Once again, they want everyone to implicitly admit
that society is not based upon relationships of production,
but only upon relationships of predation.
Black magicians think in terms of predation;
then they reproach exploitation as evil when other people do it,
and they claim it as good when <em>they</em
> do it
(though they won't utter the unholy word ``exploitation´´ in this case).
Actually, since a society based exclusively on predation is impossible,
in the end, Black Magic will be based on a fraud wherein
most followers of Black Magic will themselves
be enslaved producers, victims of predation,
but who are completely delusioned
about what is production and what is predation.

The belief in Black Magic will thus be a parasite
infesting people who actually live thanks to the creative rules of White Magic;
it may allow few real Black Magicians to live
at the expense of these people;
but it may even survive without benefitting much anyone.
</p
><p align="justify">
Sometimes, White Magic wins in the battle over vocabulary.
My favorite witness is the word ``to earn´´,
&mdash; a typically English and American word,
that has no real equivalent in French.
It implies a dynamic relationship
between a result and the means to achieve it:
through hard work, you get something valuable that you deserve.
A whole morality of creation, productivity, honesty, individual property,
personal responsibility, and liberty lies behind this word.
Yet, even as I try to describe the meaning of this libertarian word,
I have to use words that can cause confusion,
and that the authoritarians will happily hijack: hard work, productivity.
Black Magicians, who are unaware of causation relationships,
will disconnect work from its result,
and will either blame all work as bad in itself <a name="footnoteref52"></a
><a href="#footnote52"><sup><font size="-1">[52]</font
></sup
></a
>,
or otherwise praise the virtues of work as good in itself <a name="footnoteref53"></a
><a href="#footnote53"><sup><font size="-1">[53]</font
></sup
></a
>.
White Magicians value ``hard work´´,
not in proportion to the intensity of the efforts,
but in proportion to the intensity in results
<a name="footnoteref54"></a
><a href="#footnote54"><sup><font size="-1">[54]</font
></sup
></a
>.
It is understood as a law of nature
that easy gains will be quickly reaped and considered as acquired
without particular care (any required care means the gain is not so easy).
Thus, any fruitful work that predictably yields a valuable result
will probably imply some intense efforts or some rare insight.
And it is precisely the propensity
to sacrifice obvious immediate pleasures to a remote unobvious result
that deserves praise
&mdash; in as much as the remote result is indeed a net gain.
Still, what is praised is the readiness to see and act beyond immediate gains
&mdash; the ultimately greater good made possible by the immediate sacrifice;
it isn't the immediate evil of the sacrifice itself
<a name="footnoteref55"></a
><a href="#footnote55"><sup><font size="-1">[55]</font
></sup
></a
>!
The praise or lack thereof deserved by <em>hard work</em
>
can be related with the praise or lack thereof
deserved by <em>intense reflection</em
>:
what matters is not the effort spent in thinking <i>per se</i
>,
it is the result in terms of depth of the thought reached.
And even this depth is to be valued only
through the improvement in behavior that it allows;
in turn, this improvement is to be measured
in terms of enhancement in satisfactions in one's life
(including the indirect satisfactions achieved
through cooperation with other people
who can be more directly satisfied thanks to this understanding).
The goal is ``less thought, more results´´, and not the other way round
<a name="footnoteref56"></a
><a href="#footnote56"><sup><font size="-1">[56]</font
></sup
></a
>;
deep thought is good only if on the overall
it enables new strategies of behavior
that save the need for future thinking
while achieving a same or better result &mdash; it's a capital investment.

Black Magic, the Authoritarian Principle,
is a meme that profoundly distorts its victims' view of the world,
as opposed to the correct view that is achieved
with White Magic, the Libertarian Principle.
If we libertarians want to cure people from the Black Magic meme,
we must take the full consequence
of the way Black Magic distorts the understanding of its victims.
For we can cure them but by convincing them,
and while communicating with them,
we will have to cross the semantic gap
between the words as we understand them,
and the same words as these victims understand them
&mdash; with each victim having
his or her own subtly different set of distortions

></font
><p align="justify">
In the previous section,
we have identified the basic attitudes of White Magic and Black Magic
as two competing memes
(or a family of pairs of competing memes).
Now that we have studied them from the memotypical point of view
<a name="footnoteref58"></a
><a href="#footnote58"><sup><font size="-1">[58]</font
></sup
></a
>,
we shall proceed with the phenotypical point of view:
how these attitudes translate in terms of dynamic individual behavior.
</p
><p align="justify">
One crucial step of feedback between one's understanding of the world
and one's actions upon the world,
lies in the way that one decides what is good and what is bad,
which actions to prefer and which actions to avoid,
which goals to actively seek and which goals to actively shun.
These questions define
not just personal morality, not just personal taste, but personal life.
So the first question of ethics is:
is there in the world anything sacred, holy, good, or whatever the name?
The second question of ethics is:
how can we identify
the sacredness, holiness, goodness, or whateverness,
with enough precision to distinguish it from
what is base, unholy, evil and unwhatever?

And the third question of ethics is:
having identified these worthy goals,
how can we best promote them
<a name="footnoteref59"></a
><a href="#footnote59"><sup><font size="-1">[59]</font
></sup
></a
>?
</p
><p align="justify">
The first question of ethics is answered easily enough:
the very asking the question, the very breathing of the asker,
supposes that life is worthwhile;
we know some things are better than other things, we feel it,
and that's why we act to begin with
<a name="footnoteref60"></a
><a href="#footnote60"><sup><font size="-1">[60]</font
></sup
></a
>.
This dispels moral nihilism.
</p
><p align="justify">
With the second and third questions,
Black Magic and White Magic entail
opposite approaches, opposite epistemologies.
Black Magicians have a static view of the world;
they see information as flowing unilaterally,
from Authority to you, and from you to those who are further from authority.
White Magicians on the other hand have a dynamic view of the world;
information is not known wholly in advance,
and how we interact with the world is instrumental
not only in furthering good,
but also in discovering what is good to begin with.
</p
><p align="justify">
This leads to two very different structures of social organization:
the ur-structure after which Black Magicians
will model social interaction is the hierarchy;
the ur-structure after which White Magicians
will model social interaction is the enterprise.
</p
><p align="justify">
With Black Magic, each man is an ``end in himself´´,
distinct from all other men and opposite to all of them.
In-fighting is the natural mutual condition of men,
and only an externally imposed order may keep them cooperating;
and this cooperation itself may happen for only one possible common goal:
fighting common external enemies,
be them actual enemies
(wild animals that may be predators or preys,
foreign people who may either invade and enslave ``us´´
or be invaded and enslaved by ``us´´),
or symbolic enemies (that may be invaders like
unemployment, poverty, illness,
or potential slaves like
commercial processes, electricity, space).
The externally imposed order takes the form of a command structure above men;
this command structure is actuated by men who must themselves be coordinated
by a command above them, and so on, in a hierarchy,
until one man holds the ultimate command,
and obtains his Authority directly
from the official ultimate Black Magic principle of authority:
The Right of Conquest, The Ruling Class, The Superior Race,
The Natural Order of Things, God, Religion, The People, The Nation,
The Indivisible Republic, Democracy, etc.
Nature is seen as a struggle at many levels, from the Cosmic to the trivial,
and social organization matches the structure of nature,
by being divided in a nested hierarchy
of groups with common external enemies
and otherwise internal conflicts forcefully solved
by an authority keeping subgroups from freely interacting.
The prototypical figure of Black Magic is an administrative manager of men,
who commands to people below him and receives order from above.
</p
><p align="justify">
With White Magic,
each man has ends of his own,
but the ends of men are not intrinsically incompatible or opposite:
men benefit from cooperation, and their ends can thus be seen as harmonic.
Each man is thus a legitimate mean to the ends of each other man,
with cooperation being achieved by people mutually helping
to fulfill the ends of each other, both being used and using
in mutually beneficial mutual exploitation
<a name="footnoteref61"></a
><a href="#footnote61"><sup><font size="-1">[61]</font
></sup
></a
>.
The natural condition of society is thus an emerging order of cooperation;
and this cooperation happens by each man tending to his own ends,
and using other freely cooperating people as means.
Together, people may build, improve, replace and abandon
rational structures, both mechanical or social,
to master nature, to put it into motion, to react to its events,
adapt to its changes, etc.
We produce the satisfactions of the self-defined goals of our lives
by engineering natural processes into serving these ends of ours;
we implement the structures that satisfy us
with the available resources
<a name="footnoteref62"></a
><a href="#footnote62"><sup><font size="-1">[62]</font
></sup
></a
>.
The organization of defense against aggressors
is but a particular case of ensuring that the structures we create
are not destroyed by external forces;
and this taking into account
of the adverse forces that decay and destroy the structures we create
is itself an integral part
of our engineering of these dynamic structures.
Just like any other problem of life,
the danger of aggression is to be solved through free cooperation
so as to maximize output and minimize input.
The organization of society is
a dynamic adaptative structure of cooperating individuals,
coordinating through voluntary contracts tied on free markets.
To White Magicians, Life is a Creative Enterprise.
The prototypical figure of White Magic is an entrepreneurial engineer,
who masters a technique and seeks cooperation with other men
to use it at building structures that make the most satisfactions
out of the least resources

></font
><p align="justify">
To Black Magicians, certain knowledge flows
from the Authority to the mere mortals.
The ideal society of Black Magic
is thus organized hierarchically around the Authority,
in a caste division:
At the top are the priests, wise men, brahmins, inner party members,
official intellectuals, politicians, or whatever the name,
from whom flows the order of society.
Afterwards are the military, warriors, policemen,
administration clerks, civil servants, teachers and other political commissars,
who disseminate and enforce the superior order upon society.
Below is the mass of producers, workers, peasants,
craftsmen, technicians, engineers and other slaves, who do the grunt work;
though a minority of them may have advanced skills regarding mastery of nature,
they are themselves considered socially but as tools in the hands of the elite;
and while these skilled laborers have to be paid more
(or else they would abandon their skills and do grunt work like others),
the official ideology will make them less than physical laborers.
At the very bottom, barely tolerated if at all, are
the traders, merchants, money-lenders, speculators,
who do some despicable job, that is best understood as
scavenging the leftovers of the orderly administration,
profiteering from the misery of people in mysterious ways,
doing dirty tasks that are below the current higher concerns of the Hierarchy.
</p
><p align="justify">
As caricatural as it may seem,
this is exactly the model of all the totalitarian utopias:
it is the ideal followed by the ancient empires of Egypt, China <a name="footnoteref64"></a
><a href="#footnote64"><sup><font size="-1">[64]</font
></sup
></a
> or Andies;
it is the model proposed
in Plato's <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.html"><i>The Republic</i
></a
>,
in the theories of indian brahmins or european legists;
it is the vision of communism and its softened social-democrat spin-offs.
The fact that there is hardly any variation among
all the many totalitarian ideals from so many different times and places,
even in absence of intellectual communication with each other
ought to have been a strong hint of a common evil behind:
the Authoritarian Principle, Black Magic.

</p
><p align="justify">
Also, we see why a Black Magician will both revere Power in itself,
yet hate whoever is in power,
if said powerholder does not follow the One True Authority
as understood by said Black Magician:
the world in its current state is quite a dystopia to a Black Magician
who won't fully identify with government;
yet, with the pace of change in the world in general
and in governments in particular,
and with the variety of flavors of Black Magic,
full identification of people with their government is forcibly rare.
Black Magicians who identify enough with their government
will seek to take hold of it,
and to reform it toward a better match with their ideals.
Black Magicians, horrified by too great a discrepancy
between their view of Good and the current reigning authority that they reject,
will seek a revolution, or, if they are too weak, an escape,
or else, they will live as antisocial parasites ruining a society they abhor.
</p
><p align="justify">
An essential myth on which rests the Authoritarian Principle
is the myth of <em>objective knowledge</em
>,
whether it is justified as stemming from the ``true religion´´,
or, in contemporary days, from ``established science´´:
beliefs that must be accepted without possibility of dissent
by the people who receive it from the high priests;
knowledge the search of which is good if done by the official elite,
evil if done by others.
This objective knowledge is to be contrasted with the relativism
claimed by Black Magicians of late about reality
when justifying the variety in arbitrariness
of the many tyrannies they defend:
if reality contradicts their theories,
then reality is wrong, or it is ``plural´´,
so that they are exempt from the rational need of logical coherence.
</p
><p align="justify">
White Magic, on the other hand, rejects the premise
of an objective knowledge about a relative reality,
but is instead based on relative knowledge about an objective reality.
All knowledge is conjecture,
but reality provides a solid framework against which
to test and enhance our knowledge;
though it is more correct to reverse the direction of previous sentence:
reality doesn't exist to try our knowledge
and discriminate godsend truth from devil-inspired falsity;
quite on the contrary,
we develop knowledge to organize our behavior within reality,
to adjust this behavior so as to implement internal goals of ours.
</p
><p align="justify">
Note that looking at the fact that all knowledge is conjecture
from the static point of view of Black Magic
precisely leads to the fallacy of relativism,
the negation of reason, and the preeminence of brutal force
as the ultimate criterion for ``truth´´.
On the contrary, looking at that fact
from the dynamic point of view of White Magic
leads us to seeing knowledge as a bet
and to realizing that every act of life
is an entrepreneur's choice
<a name="footnoteref65"></a
><a href="#footnote65"><sup><font size="-1">[65]</font
></sup
></a
>.
In the paradigm of Black Magic,
Life is Struggle,
every man is a fighter for his own sake in an absurd world.
In the paradigm of White Magic,
Life is Entrepreneurship,
every man is the entrepreneur of his own life in a world
made meaningful by his own purpose.
</p
><p align="justify">
Indeed, any knowledge we have about the future
can only be obtained from past experience by <em>induction</em
>.
David Hume showed that induction could never lead to certain knowledge,
but only to conjectures,
for any general rule we may induce from past experience
can always be invalidated by future experience <a name="footnoteref66"></a
><a href="#footnote66"><sup><font size="-1">[66]</font
></sup
></a
>.
There are infinitely many ways to digest data into a set of rules.
However, some of these ways are simpler,
<em>considering the background knowledge</em
>
that varies with individuals and with time;
and it is in a strong sense an optimal strategy
to give exponentially more credit to simpler explanations
than to more complex ones:
such strategy minimizes the amount of time and energy being spent
while leaving the least leeway for manipulation by memes
attempting to parasite us by inserting themselves in explanations
<a name="footnoteref67"></a
><a href="#footnote67"><sup><font size="-1">[67]</font
></sup
></a
>.
</p
><p align="justify">
Now, though the same strategy, disregarding the initial knowledge,
will ultimately lead to the same asymptotic behavior
when faced with the same sequence of events
(and this constitutes its weak criterion of consistency), in practice,
we each start with a different initial knowledge,
we each have a different intellect,
we each face a different sequence of events,
and our life is too short to ever get near the asymptote.
Thus, in the end, knowledge is something subjective and personal:
it is based on experience that cannot be wholly shared;
it is adapted to each of our lives;
it is unadapted to any other person's life;
it improves from the feedback of decisions taken based on it;
it goes wild without proper feedback.
</p
><p align="justify">
The social model proposed by White Magic
is thus not a hierarchy, but an interaction,
where each individual takes intrinsically personal decisions,
with a paradigm that yields simultaneously
self-improvement and respect of other people:
liberty, responsibility, property.
</p
><p align="justify">
To Black Magicians, knowledge is sacred;
it is objectively gained by following the Authority.
To White Magicians, the learning-living process is sacred;
subjective knowledge is born out of respecting Liberty.
To Black Magicians, knowledge preexists and must be followed.
To White Magicians, knowledge is one kind of good among many,
that may be generated, at a cost, when we bet that it will be relevant
to making better decisions, for an improvement worth the cost
<a name="footnoteref68"></a
><a href="#footnote68"><sup><font size="-1">[68]</font
></sup

knowledge is never perfect, but it doesn't ever need be perfect,
it just has to be good enough &mdash; or rather,
it's one among the many parts of our individual entrepreneurial capital.

Black Magic and White Magic have opposite approaches to knowledge.
We saw how this led to two wholly different models
for the organization of society.
But it also implies opposite approaches
to how social knowledge is achieved.
Indeed, in Black Magic, those people who hold social power
still need base their decisions upon some information;
while in a simple rigid society,
a fixed hierarchy may be enough
to get orders transmitted without discussion from top to bottom,
as the society being parasited  by Black Magic grows in complexity,
such a rigid hierarchy just cannot scale;
thus, the Black Magic institutions develop tools of their own,
to produce information that Black Magicians may agree upon,
so as to take decisions as to how to prey upon the parasited society.
By contrast, in White Magic, the freedom to acquire and use knowledge
and provide knowledge-based services to other people
means that various people will specialize in various forms of knowledge,
so that other people may ignore them and still benefit;
none of the specialist will have any <i>a priori</i
> authority,
but instead, each will have to sell his services on a free market;
nonetheless, methods will be developed for specialists to acquire knowledge
as well as for laymen to detect good specialists,
in a competitive cooperative environment.
</p

The Black Magic approach to understanding the world is <em>static</em
>.
It tries to describe the world in terms of parameters,
the relevance of each of which is measured
by the emotional resonance of a change in its value,
rather than by any rational theory in terms of causation chains
in events that affect these parameters
(though as we saw in the case of public goods justification,
an appearance of rational explanation may be given
to satisfy the refrained White Magic urges of parasited people).
These parameters are in turn measured,
and the measures and their science, the <em>statistics</em
>,
are the heart of the Black Magic approach to knowledge;
they serve to justify <em>statist</em
> policies,
where the <em>State</em
>, considered as an entity outside of society,
takes measure to magically modify parameters toward a more desirable value
(as claimed to be by the <em>statisticians</em
>).
</p
><p align="justify">
Now, since there are infinitely many parameters
that may be affected by infinitely many events,
the statistical point of view <em>always</em

a partial, false, and ultimately fallacious image of the world.
Given a static set of statistic measurements,
you can always invent a statist intervention that will make them produce
better-looking figures, by ``sweeping the dirt under the rug´´:
that is, those aspects that are measured will be enhanced
by worsening everything that isn't measured;
and those aspects left unmeasured will comprise
those preconditions indispensable
for the preservation of the meaning of the measured quantities;
so that a possible positive variation of the measures
that would follow intervention wouldn't even signify a partial betterment.
Thus, when statistic measures are used as goals
(as in ``convergence criteria´´,
or governmental bragging rights about the reduction or increase of some figure)
the result is that governments will intervene in such a way that
unmeasured things will get worse
and that the measures themselves will become meaningless

The statistical justifications for government thus always consists
in (1) focusing on a particular set of measured parameters
as the ``problem´´,
disconnecting these parameters from other parameters
required to make the measure meaningful.
(2) applying an instance of the
<a href="http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html"><i>What Is Seen And What Is Not Seen</i
></a
> Fallacy
to show how some scheme could improve the measures,
without regard for fact that this intervention actually worsens
the unmeasured parameters to the point of being harmful
(3) positing governmental coercion as the magic solution
to the problem of imposing the devised scheme,
since it fails to appear by itself.
</p
><p align="justify">
The statistical attitude doesn't require figures to be wrong:
the partial focus on static parameters,
the disconnection of modifications done to these parameters
from the dynamic consequences of the means used to modify them,
the invocation of government as a magical god that can intervene for free
&mdash; all these define the statistical point of view,
and explain why it is an intellectual fraud in itself.
Figures are but a way to give pseudo-scientific value
to the statistical attitude.
They are just a ritual ornament meant to inspire awe,
in the religious staging of the statist black magic religion
<a name="footnoteref71"></a
><a href="#footnote71"><sup><font size="-1">[71]</font

</p
><p align="justify">
Of course, the more elaborate the coverage of the statistical measures,
the more complex the technocratic apparatus needed to intervene
in ways that better the measured figures
(to the detriment of the public at large).
When statistical goals are used as a guide
to develop public administrations,
the weight, cost and effectivelessness of these government agencies
will increase, producing more statistics and more complex interventions,
up until the point when even such new <em>measures</em
>
can't improve the figures anymore;
beyond that point, the government is in a permanent atmosphere of crisis,
where it works hard with no positive results,
even by its own crooked standards
<a name="footnoteref72"></a

Statistics are the tool by excellence by which governments
play the fallacy of what is seen and what is not seen.
Some try to use the government's own tool
to push government intervention away from them:
they will produce counter-statistics, etc.
But it will cost them a lot to maintain these statistics,
that will be disputed by the government, and in the end,
the best they can achieve is that government will include
new parameters in its statistics,
leading to increased, more complex and more subtle government intervention.
Counter-statistics can be an effective way
to lobby for government intervention in your favor,
if you manage to get your statistical measurements adopted by government,
or if you manage to <em>sell</em
> to government your remaining quiet.
But counter-statistics cannot be used
as a way to diminish overall government intervention.
</p
><p align="justify">
Actually, statistics were born as a tool for fiscal accounting;
in effect, it is the way for the State to track its assets.
The ``economic´´ calculus of Black Magic
is indeed based on accounting and statistics,
focusing on who possesses what riches
and who exchanged what with whom,
so as to tax them <a name="footnoteref73"></a
><a href="#footnote73"><sup><font size="-1">[73]</font
></sup
></a
>.
Citizens are forced to declare all they own and all they earn,
so that the government can take some of it away;
government in turn promises reprisals and confiscation
when citizens do not properly declare everything to the administration.
The use of statistics as a paradigm for deception
is an outgrowth of this original accounting purpose;
it is an evolutionary adaptation of the State,
when faced with a technical society where it is indispensable that
<em>some</em
> rationality be widespread in the people,
so that raw force cannot be used
without taking the deceptive appearance of reason.
</p
><p align="justify">
White Magic is based on a completely different epistemology.
It has a <em>dynamic</em
> approach to understanding the world
in terms of causation, of decisions taken based on information,
of dynamic flow of information and energy, etc.
It is a <em>cybernetical</em
> approach.
The basic notions it considers are decisions, events, choices,
each with its dynamic implications,
instead of aggregates that give static figures
independently of any causal chain.
In other words, the White Magic view of the world is still partial,
but it focuses its study on understandable means
rather than ununderstandable ends.
It allows us to take decisions that are not flawed by
the systematic bias (whether voluntary or involuntary)
of the statistic-making process.
And indeed, the information we process
can eventually influence the world but through the decisions we make.
Decisions are thus the basic element with which human life is built.
They are the very fabric of life:
	not static joy and pain,
	but responsible decisions and their consequent feedback.
</p
><p align="justify">
The accounting fallacies of Black Magic
compare the present to the past
(within the scope of a few parameters, while others are hidden);
they attribute credit to ones and debit to others
(in practice, the privileged get the credit, and the exploited pay);
accounting is a record of property transfers;
it gives information on what happened,
but cannot in any way predict what will happen
to adapt to the inevitable change of life.
Now, when one makes a <em>choice</em
>, one is <em>never, ever</em
>
choosing between the future and the past;
time flows, whether one agrees to it or not.
One is <em>always, forever</em
>, choosing between multiple futures.
Hence morality and economics
(and actually, economics is the very same as morality)
is <em>never</em
> concerned about accounting costs;
instead, it is <em>always</em
> concerned about <em>opportunity costs</em
>,
that is, expected difference of outcome between the various opportunities.
Accounting costs are <em>irrelevant</em
>;
the only people who <em>ever</em
> care about accounting costs
are tax officers &mdash; in other words, robbers
<a name="footnoteref74"></a
><a href="#footnote74"><sup><font size="-1">[74]</font
></sup
></a
>.
</p
><p align="justify">
Economic calculus in the White Magic paradigm is thus praxeological reasoning:
It considers the opportunity cost of various decisions,
rather than the irrelevant accounting costs.
It compares the present to several possible futures,
as indexed by the various actual choices that one faces,
rather than by miraculous changes in external parameters.
It tries to evaluate what are the difference
between the various outcomes that each available alternative can bring
(which difference is the economic cost of the alternative,
also known as its opportunity cost).
It gives information on what could happen,
and is a tool for decision-making.
It serves as a guide to allocate each resource
to one project rather than one another.
</p
><p align="justify">
Given the knowledge of the various opportunity costs,
and the preferences of individuals,
the praxeologist proceeds to determine
which decisions will be preferred and taken.
Of course, the knowledge of the various opportunity costs
might be but partially known, and these costs evaluated differently
by various individuals depending on their own knowledge and preferences.
But this can itself be viewed as an opportunity:
it means that exchange of information between people
can help them take better decisions,
by having better models of each other's and their own
preferences and opportunities,
so as to adapt not only to what nature can do
but also to what each other will do.
Thus even though this information about opportunities and preferences
<a name="footnoteref75"></a
><a href="#footnote75"><sup><font size="-1">[75]</font
></sup
></a
>
may depend on a lot of unknown or unmastered factors,
it is possible to make useful predictions;
moreover, cooperation between people allows to actually
diminish risks and lessen the effects of unmastered factors,
by sharing knowledge,
by building elaborate strategies based on coordinated action,
by distributing responsibilities about each subject
to those who know better about the field, etc.
</p
><p align="justify">
The precise prediction of the outcome of the combination of all human choices,
considering all the particular conditions in which these choices happen,
is out of reach of any person or combination of person
&mdash; if only because the knowledge on which to base this prediction
is itself not available. We can never know for sure which of two choices
another person will prefer, unless we do offer him to make the choice,
and see what he chooses, at which point it is too late to make a prediction.
And that is for one choice only,
whereas the combination of all human action is much more complex.
Thus, the full understanding of human society is beyond the reach of anyone.
But that doesn't mean more partial forms of understanding are unachievable,
and that no useful prescriptions are possible.
Indeed, it is possible to discern immutable general laws of human behavior,
that are no less laws of nature than are the laws of electromagnetism;
and from the knowledge of these laws,
it is possible to deduce general principles of behavior,
and an art of behavioral engineering,
much like there are general safety rules
for the use of electromagnetic devices
and an art of electrical engineering.
</p
><p align="justify">
From the rules that people explicitly acknowledge or implicitly follow,
an order emerges in society.
This order is seldom if ever used as an explanation
to justify the rules to follow
&mdash; what matters, though, is that said order
is actually an inevitable consequence of the acceptance of the rules.
Cyberneticians are interested in these rules,
what they are, what they can be,
how they affect the emerging order,
how to change them, within what limits they can be changed,
what recipes can be followed to build better behavior, etc.
While studying rules of behavior,
cyberneticians will pay particular attention to variants and invariants:
which potentials and which information are being conserved
by which kind of events, and which are irreversibly spent;
which phenomena are the locus of positive feedback,
and are conducive to evolutionary forces;
which phenomena are the locus of negative feedback,
and are conducive to partial equilibria;
which events modify available opportunities, etc.
With such an analysis, it becomes possible to systematically
weed out such fallacies as
<em>that which is seen and that which is unseen</em
>
that defy basic natural laws of conservation,
and to focus energy and attention on plans that may actually work.

White Magic and Black Magic differ not only in the way they encourage us
to gather information and determine what is good,
but also in the way they have us act toward what we think is good.
Whereas the static thinking of Black Magic implies
an ends-oriented theory of moral action,
the dynamic thinking of White Magic implies
a means-oriented theory of justice.
</p
><p align="justify">
The Authoritarian Principle argues that some people know what is good,
that they have the authority to determine what is good.
Consequently, for authoritarians,
people who go against opinions expressed by this authority
are acting in evil ways, and should be prevented from doing it;
coercion is thus considered as a legitimate way
to enforce against dissenters the opinions of authority
upon its acknowledged domain.
</p
><p align="justify">
On the contrary,
the Libertarian Principle argues that
goodness in general and useful knowledge in particular
emerge from each person being free of choosing
and responsible for one's choices
within the limits of the property one creates and acquires.
To paraphrase Hayek,
we libertarians do not deny that there are superior people,
better choices, moral and immoral deeds, etc.
What we deny is that anyone would have the authority
to decide who these superior people are,
what these better choices are, which deeds are moral or immoral, etc.
<a name="footnoteref76"></a
><a href="#footnote76"><sup><font size="-1">[76]</font
></sup
></a
>
</p
><p align="justify">
Indeed, assuming that some people know better,
how do we establish who these people are?
Authority does not solve the problem of the knowledge of what's good;
it only pushes this problem back,
to be swept under the rug of irrationality.
Ultimately, each individual, so as to determine which authority to heed,
will still have to use
one's own reason, one's own experience, one's own traditions
(that are but experience accumulated for centuries).
One's own mind is irreducibly the ultimate criterion
for one's own choices, even if one chooses to delegate;
some personal liberty and responsibility cannot be negated,
even by the most authoritarian setting.
</p
><p align="justify">
For even if <em>you</em
> accept some authority,
even if God speaks directly to you and you know it,
other people might not know it.
They have no means to ascertain your claims,
and thus they have no reason to believe you <i>a priori</i
>,
to follow the exact same authority,
etc.
There's no way they can reasonably trust your word for it.
And even if they agree with you in a formal way,
agreeing to your opinion,
using the very same words as come from the very same authority,
they might actually have a different interpretation of these words,
they might understand them with a different meaning,
with subtle but essential differences.
So even with a formal agreement on a common authority,
there remains the question of
	how one can communicate one's actual ideas of what Good is,
		and have them prevail against opposing ideas.
Supposing one knows what good is,
	how can one have <em>other people</em
> also know what good is?
Assuming that one's notion of good has a potential meaning to other people
	that one wishes to transmit,
	what are the legitimate or efficient ways
	to achieve this transmission?
</p
><p align="justify">
This is another way by which the Authoritarian Principle
cannot evade the practical necessity of having
to convince people through peaceful ways:
every would-be authority doesn't have the direct individual resources
to coerce at most but a few other people into doing one's bidding;
it is only by acquiring the cooperation of
minions, henchmen, followers and accomplices
that one can extend one's grip on unconsenting individuals.
And all these servants and accomplices have to be
convinced, seduced, or otherwise persuaded,
not out of a preexisting authority,
but out of non-authoritarian means.
Now, in the case of Black Magic,
these non-authoritarian ways include fraud and deception,
the culture of superstition and irrationality, as well as
gangs of consenting mobsters victimizing unconsenting third parties.
</p
><p align="justify">
On the contrary, the Libertarian Principle,
since it bars authority, coercion, fraud, deception and
any kind of victimization,
induces the development of very particular means
to acquire the cooperation of other people:
rational discussion, or at least
seduction in a way compatible with rational criticism.
It can even be said that rational or otherwise logical reasoning in general
are born out of the liberty to negociate under what terms to cooperate,
and to ultimately choose whether to cooperate or not.
And therefore it is no surprise that axiomatic mathematics was born
in the freest cities of Greece.
Indeed, when free people have to gain
	the voluntary acceptance of other free people,
	including foreigners from other cities,
	so as to cooperate,
one has to convince other people that it is their interest to cooperate,
and at the same time
one must avoid being foolishly convinced against one's own interest.
Thus, in a society of mutually free individuals,
everyone develops to some degree skills
	in both communication (rhetorics, dialectics)
	and analysis of communication (logic, politics).
And these skills are only developed in such societies
of free and responsible people:
for there is no interest to invest in reason when one is not going to decide
or when one is not going to suffer the consequences of one's own decisions,
whereas one has to decide well when one is free and accountable.
Hence coercion makes people irresponsible and irrational,
whereas freedom makes people responsible and reasonable.
That irrational seduction develops and prospers is a sure sign
that the principles of freedom and accountability are not being respected.
</p
><p align="justify">
Let us now investigate the quintessential legacy
of the Authoritarian Principle:
coercion made a legitimate means of action.
Coercion does not convince &mdash; it cannot.
Its very principle is to eschew conviction and the means to achieve it.
It can make people do what you desire
		&mdash; but only if you're the strongest
		&mdash; and only for a moment,
		after which things are even worse than before.
For not only will people have remained unconvinced,
they will also have abandoned the now unnecessary mental tools
of rationality and responsibility necessary to develop deep conviction.
This is why coercion can never be used to make people moral,
according to anyone's idea of morality:
	they will remain as immoral as before,
	just more so for accepting the rule of their masters,
	while the masters themselves become monsters.
It makes the subjects hypocrites and the masters haughty.
In one case, they are under the power of other people's will,
and lose all sense of responsibility.
In the other case, they are unaccountable of their decisions
as long as they remain in power,
and become prisoner of their violent means of living.
In both cases, they end up being both unfree and irresponsible.

The eventual vanity of coercion as a principle of action
has been nicely summarized by

><p align="justify">
Now that we saw the static and dynamic principles of Black Magic,
we can examine the effects of Black Magic in real-life,
and relate its modern expressions to their traditional archetypes.
</p
><p align="justify">
<u>Human sacrifices</u
>:
Black Magicians invoke sacrifice as good in itself,
something that pleases the gods,
with the ultimate sacrifice being human sacrifice.
They will thus justify killing for the good of the people:
for instance, Aztec priests used to sacrifice humans everyday,
so that sun would rise again tomorrow.
Nowadays, the primitive form of human sacrifices is not so frequent,
but such sacrifices still exist in disguised forms:
wars, embargoes and other governmental operations
cause many direct deaths, collateral damages
and other ``inevitable casualties´´
that serve to satisfy the power trip of political managers,
under the pretense of domestic security,
the defense of democracy, national interest,
the indivisible union of the republic, etc.
directors of intelligence agencies may even let
the people they are meant to protect get killed
so as to promote their agenda of stricter ``security measures´´
toward the public opinion.
To Black Magicians, individual human lives are ``expandable´´
before the superior motives of the collectivist entity
they claim to dictate.
</p
><p align="justify">
<u>Zombies</u
>:
Black Magicians create beings that are more dead than live.
For that, they typically hypnotize and drug their victims,
that they then use as slaves until they die;
such people might not be very productive,
but the magicians don't care since <em>they</em
> get to benefit,
even though the operation is a greater loss to the victims,
and a net loss for global welfare.
The chosen victims were often first drugged into faking death,
so that the Black Magician could pass as its resurrecter  and savior.
Nowadays, workers are forced to surrender the four fifth of their lives;
citizens are deprived from the responsible choices
that are the very stuff life is made of.
They are not so much of living beings,
though they aren't completely dead either.
Yet, the Black Magicians of government claim being their saviors,
and their owing the little life they have left to government intervention.
And indeed, since the official statistics don't make the difference
between a living man and a zombie,
they will serve as a justification to whatever policy
will ``enhance´´ the visible official statistics
at the invisible cost of transforming humans into zombies.
</p
><p align="justify">
<u>Material Sacrifices</u
>:
Black Magicians will require destructions meant to appease the gods:
valuable goods are destroyed
in the hope of a magic reaction from the gods,
outside of any rational mechanism of natural causation
that will link the sacrifices to any positive effect.
Of course, Black Magicians will insist on the importance that
a properly anointed priest should control the sacrifice
(and be paid for his office, obviously).
Non-ritual sacrifices will be recognized for
the murder, vandalism, robbery and fraud that they are;
whereas ritualized sacrifices under control of Black Magic priesthood
will be presented as valid and working invocations.
For instance, private forging of money somehow
will be decried as robbery and decreasing total wealth,
whereas government-backed inflation,
which amounts to the same forging of money,
will be boasted as somehow increasing wealth.
Governments will build great public monuments at great expenses;
they will build roads, plan up massive economic intervention, etc.;
for that, they will demand the public to consent to new taxes as a sacrifice
necessary for the Godvernment
to grant them its divine benefits.
When faced with the shortage and failure
of government supplied goods and services,
they will invoke the civic duty to reduce their consumption and expectations.
They will invoke the reduction in work time,
so as to diminish unemployment <a name="footnoteref78"></a
><a href="#footnote78"><sup><font size="-1">[78]</font
></sup
></a
>.
Though material sacrifices do not end human lives,
they spend the human life that was necessary to build the sacrificed material.
Just like zombifying people is enslavement
&mdash; the partial murder of one's future, &mdash;
material sacrifices are robbery &mdash; the partial murder of one's past
<a name="footnoteref79"></a
><a href="#footnote79"><sup><font size="-1">[79]</font
></sup
></a
>.
</p
><p align="justify">
Sacrifices have many effects that reinforce the power of Black Magic:
they benefit the priests of Black Magic who levy their share of the loot;
they thus create a class of powerful citizens interested
in maintaining the belief.
Properly directed, sacrifices will destroy the enemies of Black Magic,
and deprive them of the resources through which they could grow.
Sacrifices commit all those who participate in such abominations;
these people, to preserve respect for themselves,
will refuse to acknowledge
their own foolishness, their own sins, their own crimes;
to relieve their own guilt,
they will happily reject the blame on the sacrificial lambs,
the victims of ritual sacrifices, or some other symbolic enemies.
Sacrifices divert the attention of the public away
from the real causes of their sorrow, the real grieves, the real culprits,
toward the accomplishment of the ritual.
Sacrifices give hope to the believers,
that since the sacrifice was made, now their lives will get better;
with this hope, believers will continue to get the system going.
Sacrifices give fear to the believers,
that if the sacrifice were not made, their lives would get worse;
with this fear, believers will prevent changes from toppling the system.
</p
><a name="SUBSECTION_6.2"></a
><font size="+1" face="sans-serif"><b>6.2 Black Magic Spells</b
></font
><p align="justify">
In Black Magic, the priests cast spells:
they recite formulas, conduct rituals, make magic items.
The goal of these spells is manifold:
they divert the attention of followers
from topics where reasoning could show the absurdity of Black Magic;
they focus this attention on some activities
that the Black Magicians control;
they give an opportunity for the Black Magicians to get paid
for these activities;
they cultivate habits of dependency among the followers;
they turn the intensity of cult worship
into a means of social signalling  among the followers,
with followers competing to be more prominent worshippers,
and excluding the lesser worshippers (or worse, non-worshippers)
from high-profile social activities (or from society at all,
when the power of Black Magicians is great enough).
</p
><p align="justify">
Black Magicians brew magic potions and recite formulas
that they promise will have various beneficial effects
if followers drink the potions and follow the rituals.
The modern Black Magic forms of these potions and formulas are
legislative jaculations, political platforms,
demonstrators' demands, strikers' requests.
If you should back the projects of politicians,
then things will improve for you, &mdash; or so they say.
The laws being voted, the regulations being issued
are as many magic formulas meant to dispel evil.
People, those who enforce as well as those who endure,
don't have to understand the mechanisms of these laws,
the reasons why they are meant to bring prosperity;
they have to be smitten by the magic of these laws,
by their superficial appearance of goodness,
by their official purpose full of good intentions,
by the congruence of their rituals with other accepted rituals.
Oftentimes, the people who participate in these rituals
will recognize how absurd and destructive they are,
but they will nevertheless abide by the prescriptions of Black Magic,
and accept the belief that these obvious failures
are but part of a beneficial big picture,
and maybe even the consequence of a lack of respect for Black Magic principles,
to be solved by appeals to more Black Magic.
</p
><p align="justify">
Black Magicians use voodoo dolls as symbols of enemies and phenomena
that they claim to master through symbolic intervention.
They use these symbolic interventions to claim as their success
any progress visible against enemies or in the phenomena,
whereas any regress will be the fault
of people not complying to their precepts,
or otherwise of a lack of Black Magic power and intervention.
Modern Black Magicians use statistical models for this very same purpose.
Expert statisticians will build models tailored to justify
any desired intervention by the government,
and to explain how it is thanks to government intervention
that the economy is going better.
</p
><p align="justify">
Black Magicians regularly call for massive religious gatherings,
so as to build up cosmic forces, so as to summon good spirits.
These grand masses have none
of their proclaimed magic effects on the external world;
their real purpose is their effect upon the members of the cult themselves:
they are the opportunity
to demonstrate the strength of the movement in face of opposite odds;
they serve to assess the loyalty of members to the movement,
and to force people into committing to the movement;
they rouse tribal feelings of belonging to the group,
and other crowd reactions;
they strengthen the members' view of the world as ``us against them´´;
they confirm the Black Magicians as the leaders of the mob.
Votes, polls, referendums, mass demonstrations, etc.,
are to a great extent such Black Magic masses:
they don't have much effect on the outcome of events,
but serve to give a mantle of legitimacy
to those who rule in the name of the Common Cause.
</p
><p align="justify">
Black Magic is a tool to confer power to a class of priests, higher and lower.
The modern form of Black Magic serves
its own class of politicians, big and small.
They interpret the ``will of the people´´
	or whatever the official ruling principle is.
The religious class is organized in a hierarchy of actual rulers.
Aside this hierarchy is also a large class of theologians
who will invent intellectual justifications
for the regime and its interventions,
as well as provide a reserve of potential rulers.
The modern form of this class of men is the intelligentsia,
made of ``experts´´, statisticians, statist ``economists´´, etc.
Most of them will be paid by government or otherwise receive various privileges
as university professors, directors of various administrations, journalists,
political consultants, etc.
These alleged brainiacs will provide alibis to Black Magic;
they give it the apparent authority of reason.
The apparatus of State-controlled intellectual activities
will offer to intellectuals the choice between two opportunities:
they may live well as servants of the Minotaur
<a name="footnoteref80"></a
><a href="#footnote80"><sup><font size="-1">[80]</font

></a
>,
gaining in social status as they spread the official ways of thinking;
or they may be officially discredited
and be excluded from controlled means of communication
should they prefer to be dissidents.
</p
><p align="justify">
Black Magic, being based on wishful thinking rather than reason,
always insists on intents rather than causal connections.
In popular literature,
a pure heart, &mdash; according to the Black Magicians' morality, &mdash;
rather than patiently developed skills,
&mdash; as adapted to mastering nature, &mdash;
is the key to all blessings.
In modern Black Magic, this focus on intents is still prominent.
Political measures are backed not with an explanation of their effects,
but as serving the just cause of the people, of the workers, etc.
Leaders will display how touchy-feely they are,
they will cultivate feelings and sentiments;
anyone trying to analyze rationally and debunk their justifications
will be dismissed as having dark intents,
as being an ``enemy of class´´,
a servant of Evil, of foreign enemy forces.
As marxists used to explicitly say, to Black Magicians,
it doesn't matter what you say, it only matters ``where you speak from´´.
</p
><p align="justify">
Black Magic is based on a manichean view of the world,
where the Black Magicians assume the role of Good, White, etc.,
whereas anything that stands up against their aims
is considered as Evil, Black, etc.
In this manichean cosmic struggle,
everyone is forced to take one of two sides.
This is the quintessence of political polarization.
Of course, among Black Magicians themselves,
factions that compete for power will each claim to be White,
whereas the opposite faction is Black,
or at least manipulated by evil forces, or allied to them,
or at best ``objectively allied´´ to them.
In democracies, this competition for the claim of being good against evil
takes paradoxical form, as the political life is polarized in two poles
(left and right), each identified by its radicals, but at the same time,
each competing for the marginal voters around the median opinion,
far from the professed radical ideals used
for intellectual justification of the parties.
People in democracies, are thus led to constantly choose
between the ``Lesser of two evils´´,
away from either of the two main branches of Black Magic ideals.
Democrats are both aware of this limitation of democracy
as the means to advance their Black Magic ideals
<a name="footnoteref81"></a
><a href="#footnote81"><sup><font size="-1">[81]</font
></sup
></a
>,
and at the same time, fanatically attached to democracy
as part of the consensual doctrine accepted by the two main branches
of democratic Black Magic.
</p
><p align="justify">
Another paradox of Black Magicians is their relationship with money.
They will institute a precise accounting of private and public activities
in terms of money, so as to be able to tax the ones and fund the others;
they will thus express everything in terms of money;
they will see money everywhere.
Money is a magic thing to them;
when any emergency happens,
all the government has to do is to ``unblock money´´
so as to fund a budget for whatever emergency measures have to be taken.
Black Magicians worship, admire, envy, desire the power conferred by money.
They love to generously spend other people's money,
with laws, subventions, feasts, institutions, constructions, etc.
However, doing so, they spend not just people's money, but also their lives:

for the utility of money comes from its use as an intermediate for
the adaptive cooperation of individuals
who are free to choose how to cooperate or not.
The power of money is ultimately tied to the freedom and creation
of White Magic;
people only accept government-controlled money as a compulsory legal tender
because they expect that despite the inconvenience,
they will be able to use it as a practical universal intermediate
in free trade.
So Black Magicians are ambivalent about this.
They hate the Free Market and all it represents,
because it is a negation of their basic premises.
At the same time, they recognize that a Free Market economy
is inevitable, and indispensable, if they have to have anything to prey upon.
Black Magicians will thus learn to have a double hypocritical attitude
regarding money:
they will openly claim it as good
when it is confiscated and spent by the Godvernment,
and as an instrument of vice to be despised when it is in private hands;
yet they will do whatever they can so that the money flows,
sacrificing their ideals to the private lobbyists who promise prosperity;
finally, they will personally indulge to the power of
this great ``corrupter´´ that is money,
although by identifying themselves with the Great Cause,
they will easily pardon this vice
in regard to the services that they render to the Nation
(or whichever the Great Cause is).
</p
><p align="justify">
Black Magic leads to many such paradoxes,
and Black Magicians must thus train themselves and their followers
into techniques of double-think,
whereby they will be able to manipulate concepts
from two or more logically contradictory points of view,
depending on the context,
while actively avoiding any situation
where the contradictions become too obvious.
The ultimate spell of Black Magic is thus
to confer its followers some kind of schizophrenia
allowing them to survive despite the contradictions
upon which their beliefs are founded <a name="footnoteref82"></a

></a

</p
><a name="SUBSECTION_6.3"></a
><font size="+1" face="sans-serif"><b>6.3 Staging the Worship</b
></font
><p align="justify">
Black Magic is a cult that must be kept alive
by constantly occupying the minds of people.
And the best way to occupy their minds is to also occupy their bodies.
The Godvernment will seek to intervene in any and every aspect of social life.
It will even intervene in so very personal things
as intimate relations between people in love,
by regulating marriage,
giving it an important place in fiscal and civil regulations, etc.
Any domain that is not subject to heavy regulations is disconsidered
as lawless savagery, a wild anarchy, a lack of legislation,
to be promptly remedied by new legislation.
At the same time, all this intervention must be accompanied
by constant rhetorics, by appeal to the citizens' spirits,
and ultimately by actual concern of anxious citizens,
so that the Godvernment will appear positively rather than negatively.
This is why Black Magicians will resort to a series of tricks
so as to stage the public worship of Black Magic.
</p
><p align="justify">
War is the grandest way in which the Godvernment is presented
as the savior of the People.
War may be an actual war against a foreign country,
if possible led by an obvious tyrant.
It may also be war against unofficial governments reigning over areas
abandonned by official legal governments:
the mafia, drug trafficking organizations, terrorists, guerillas, etc.
In a more rhetorical way,
it may be war against some official vice:
drug consumption, smoking, prostitution, drinking, unofficial religions, etc.
Politicians will resort to the vocabulary of war even as they claim to
fight poverty, fight unemployment, fight any ``social disease´´ or misery.
All these wars serve as a justification to the State
impersonating the role of Good in a cosmic struggle between Good and Evil.
Their ultimate goal is not external, it is internal:
the important effect and strong incentive for Black Magicians to wage war
is not to fight the claimed enemy,
but to tighten the subjection of the allegedly protected citizens
<a name="footnoteref83"></a
><a href="#footnote83"><sup><font size="-1">[83]</font
></sup
></a
>.
The ``exceptional´´ situation of war will serve
as an excuse for whatever crimes and attempts to the rule of law
that godvernmental forces may commit,
as well as a diversion from whatever misachievements they may make
on ``secondary´´ fronts.
This situation of exception is so beneficial to Black Magicians
that they will make it become permanent:
indeed, once they have spread the idea that
they are the solution rather than the problem,
they will use the very failures of their policies
as a pretense for ever increasing their interventions.
An initially small temporary intervention
will thus eventually turn
into a permanent war to struggle against the permanent fiasco
caused by the very intervention of the State.
</p
><p align="justify">
Throughout all their staging of life as a cosmic struggle,
Black Magicians will cultivate among their followers
a feeling of righteousness.
According to Black Magicians, the world is ``us´´ against ``them´´,
it is friends versus foes &mdash; and you better be among friends.
Friends are to be identified by their intents, their community of interests,
their belonging to a nation or a race or a social class
or any other category proposed by the Black Magicians' ideology.
Black Magicians thus propose an easy, undemanding, relaxing, and false grid
for understanding the universe <a name="footnoteref84"></a
><a href="#footnote84"><sup><font size="-1">[84]</font
></sup
></a
>. This simple grid offers followers the immediate benefit
of saving the need for sustained enquiry,
indulging their intellectual sloth <a name="footnoteref85"></a
><a href="#footnote85"><sup><font size="-1">[85]</font
></sup
></a
>.
According to this grid,
bad guys will be equated with people with bad intents,
and the other way round,
while similarly good guys will be equated both ways
with people with officially good intents <a name="footnoteref86"></a
><a href="#footnote86"><sup><font size="-1">[86]</font
></sup
></a
>.
Enemies who claim to have good intents will be classified as hypocrits,
or as deeply misguided pawns manipulated by a greater Evil.
Friends who have bad intents are to be justified, pardonned, or excommunicated.
This polarization of life in its extreme forms can lead to Conspiracy theory,
where some people want to see
a common intent, a common will, concerted interests, a central organization
behind any Great Evil in the world.
Anything wrong must have been meant as wrongdoing
<a name="footnoteref87"></a
><a href="#footnote87"><sup><font size="-1">[87]</font
></sup
></a
>.
The dual form of Conspiracy Theory is much scarier: Totalitarianism.
It is the belief that, at some scale, there can be any Good in the world
only if behind it there is
a common intent, a common will, concerted interests, a central organization.
All in all, this Black Magic polarization
of people's vision of the world is Animism:
the want to see willful intent everywhere.

><a name="SUBSECTION_6.4"></a
><font size="+1" face="sans-serif"><b>6.4 Does Black Magic Work?</b

><p align="justify">
Our claim all throughout this essay is that
Black Magic, the Authoritarian Principle, is an intellectual fraud;
it is a mental illness;
it is a parasite meme that makes people insane;
it is a profoundly erroneous view of reality.
There is a fundamental inadequacy between the discourse of Black Magic
and the very actions of Black Magicians,
that ultimately take place in the real world,
the reality of which doesn't match the expectations provided by Black Magic.
Black Magicians may choose to be ignorant of nature and to revolt against it,
but by very definition, neither their whims nor their actions
will ever change the laws of nature
<a name="footnoteref88"></a
><a href="#footnote88"><sup><font size="-1">[88]</font
></sup
></a
>.
Furthermore, we affirm that White Magic, the Libertarian Principle,
is a correct paradigm for apprehending Life;
it is mental sanity,
a valid way of understanding the universe as we may live in it.
</p
><p align="justify">
Yet at the same time, we take note that Black Magic,
though it may bring sorrow, distress, failure, suffering and death
to its followers and their victims,
is itself surviving and prospering: It is a Memetic success.
It is another proof case where memetic fitness for a meme to survive
is not the same as the fitness to survive for those who adopt it,
or as the propensity of said meme
to pass the test of rational criticism.
Black Magic somehow ``works´´, but it doesn't work <em>as advertised</em
>.
This is why we must examine the real reasons for its success.
We must ask ourselves, what makes Black Magic so successful?
What are the memetic forces that lead to Black Magic?
What are the memetic forces that may help to resist and dispel Black Magic?
On the long run, is Black Magic going to grow or to dim away?
And what can we do about it?
</p
><p align="justify">
Black Magic spreads based
on faith and fear and other basic emotions,
on animal reflexes, on intellectual sloth,
on a primitive way of thinking
through emotional associations, symmetrical binary relations.
It appeals to the primitive parts of man's mind
and develops the pride of keeping one's mind in a primitive state.
Indeed, Black Magic consists precisely of withholding rational thinking,
and letting someone else &mdash; the Authority &mdash; decide on one's behalf.
This Authority may be a past tradition, a present ruler,
or a future power accepted in advance as a ruler
(as with political elections).
Black Magic is essentially the promise that a friendly superior force
will solve your problems if you abandon your fate with faith in its hands.
It is the faithful abandon of responsibility.
It is the sweet bliss of ignorance.
The ignorance that it spreads is itself the protection
against the realization of the misery that the same ignorance causes.
Black Magicians worship the holy warranty
that the Godvernment promises to them about the difficulties of their lives;
Goverment as the ultimate fallback plan;
Security out thin air, if only you have faith.
As with all kinds of faith, people believe because
``it would be so nice if it were true.´´
Those who deny the value of the promise
are seen as enemies who try to destroy this value, assumed to exist.
</p
><p align="justify">
Black magicians hate the Free Market,
because it is not a personal god that they can bribe.
But at the same time, they find it easy to blame the Free Market
because it has no authoritative spokesman that can defend it:
the common interest incarnate in Free Market
is not any particular lobby's interest,
and will find few people to actually defend it
(as opposed to claiming to defend it
while demanding protectionist measures for a special interest group).
So Black Magic can survive through the distortion of reality
by which it promotes the special interest
of a focused group of organized predators
who exploit a widespread group of disorganized preys,
while making believe that it promotes the general welfare.
People are born ignorant, and Black Magicians
will cultivate and grow this ignorance among people
as long as they can, so as to victimize them.
</p
><p align="justify">
Now, ignorance is not a stable state
<a name="footnoteref89"></a
><a href="#footnote89"><sup><font size="-1">[89]</font

>.
Once someone is taught the principles of White Magic,
and shown the nocivity of Black Magic,
it becomes much more difficult to attract one's active support
in participating to the cult of Black Magic,
helping to victimize oneself and other people.
And knowledge is irreversible:
once someone knows such a simple principle as White Magic,
one knows it until one dies.
That is why Black Magicians must spend efforts
at trying to prevent people from thinking,
and from ever being put in tight contact with the paradigm of White Magic.
But these efforts will increase as methods are developed
for spreading knowledge of the reality behind Black Magic.
Ultimately, it hopefully will become so hard to remain ignorant,
and so expensive to maintain other people in ignorance,
that investing in Black Magic will be no more marginally profitable.

Government lives on Black Magic.
Government produces Black Magic.
But Government is <em>not</em
> Black Magic.
More precisely, the Principle of Government
is the main instance of Black Magic;
however the body of people and activities known as ``Government´´ is not.
Though they are historically, emotionally and semantically related,
these two meanings of the word ``Government´´ must be distinguished,
if we are to apply White Magic rational thinking to the underlying concepts,
instead of merely Black Magic emotional feeling of them.
</p
><p align="justify">
On the one hand Government &mdash; its Authoritarian Principle &mdash;
will monopolize, absorb and corrupt
the production or delivery of goods and services
actually produced through White Magic,
and now made part of Government &mdash; the Administrative body.
Government &mdash; the Principle embraced
by the rulers of the Administration &mdash;
will latter use these monopolies
as justifications for its existence:
``public goods´´ that only It (the body) provides,
because It prohibits competition or regulates it away.
However, the goods and services being monopolized by Government,
the productive parts of the Administration,
are in fact creations of White Magic.
Hence, these parts of Government &mdash; the Administrative body &mdash;
we do not seek to destroy,
but verily to free and regenerate:
we wish to remove the chains that subject
these services, their producers and their consumers
to the Authoritarian Principle of Government.
</p
><p align="justify">
Now not only is Government (the body) not made of pure Black Magic
(since it absorbs White Magic components),
but Black Magic is also very much present outside Government (the body)
and even to some degree outside of Government (the openly claimed Principle).
There are plenty of accomplices to the activities of Governments as such,
who albeit having a status of ``private´´ people and organizations,
end up benefitting from public privileges;
these accomplices serve to ``privatize´´ the rent captured
by those who hold power.
There are also plenty of candidates
who wish to replace current governments
with new governments of their own,
based on even more retrograde forms of Black Magic than currently rule:
this includes all the religious fundamentalist movements,
the worst among them being the socialist revolutionaries, etc.
Then there are plenty of bandits and frauds
who feed on the weakness, credulity and superstition of other people,
though on a much pettier scale than instituted governments.
Finally, Black Magic exists as part of the activities of many people
who otherwise live through White Magic:
political activists who do their best to get some party elected,
trade unionists who demonstrate in the streets for their corporate interests,
businessmen who pay lobbyists to court politicians,
all these people have both this Black Magic activity of political manipulation,
and (usually) a main White Magic activity of production.
The latter kind of people constitute the major body of Black Magicians;
most of them are victims of Black Magic as well as servants of it,
suffering from the consequences of the mental illness
that they wilfully propagate.
</p
><p align="justify">
Thus, Government, as an instituted body, is not the main Enemy,
	it is but the manifestation of the Enemy.
Should we manage to destroy the current government, evil as it may be,
	if we didn't dispel the belief in Black Magic,
	then Black Magic will spurt off a new government,
	just as evil as the preceding one;
and any violent means we used to destroy the previous government
will only have resulted in pain and destruction
while evicting the old government,
and pain and destruction again
as a new government struggles to establish its new power over people.
Our main Enemy is more elusive, it resides in people's minds:
it is the very belief in Black Magic,
it is a disease from which we want to cure people.
It is not Government as a body, it is Government as an idea;
it is not the State, it is Statism;
it is not the political militants, it is politics.
Our Enemy is a mental illness, not the victims it infects.
Our Enemy is a view of the world
where the interests of people are antagonistic instead of harmonic.
Our Enemy is the principle behind Enmity itself

Let us not overestimate the Enemy:
	it is not a devil endowed with a personal will;
	it is not capable of any coherent synchronized overall action;
	it cannot design concerted plans of action.
Black Magicians may be animists, we are not;
we know that some phenomena emerge without any wilful intent
	nor any concerted action.
On the other hand, let us not underestimate the enemy:
	it is not susceptible to be destroyed by a focused, narrow action,
	whereby we'd neutralize a few key people.
Of course, such surgical actions may be necessary
	as a small but important part of an overall treatment,
	to inhibit the catalyzers of Black Magic;
but the treatment cannot be narrow,
	for the meme of Black Magic is widespread in the human population,
	and is active even inside those of us
	who are conscious of its nefarious nature.
The treatment will involve some form of education,
	to build some awareness of the Evil
	in those who currently think in political terms,
	and to build some healthy reflexes in everyone.
</p

Among the most potent obstacles that we will face,
the more dangerous and evil people will not be
the victims completely infected by Black Magic,
those mindless superstitious people who abandonned their lives
into the hands of Authority;
these people are incapable of initiating rational, efficient action;
though they may act in evil ways,
their mechanisms of thought can be well understood;
their actions can be foreseen;
remedies can be found for them.
Our most dangerous enemies will be those who use White Magic
to efficiently cultivate Black Magic in other people,
so as to unilaterally exploit them.
Our most dangerous obstacles are Grey Magicians,
who master enough of both forms of Magic
so as to delude other people into serving them.
These people understand the issues at hand;
they can use White Magic techniques of rational design
to lead and move the masses infected by Black Magic;
and their interest is in preserving some form of Black Magic in other people.
We must learn how these Grey Magicians think,
how we can counter their work of evil,
how we can turn some of them to our side,
how we can use them to neutralize each other,
how we can subvert their activity against Black Magic itself.
Now, these Grey Magicians will adapt to our action;
they will design new plans;
they too will try to neutralize us,
or to subvert our actions to their profit.

If we want our actions to be efficient,
we must eradicate the source of the evil that destroys our freedom.
It may be expedient to fight the visible manifestations of Evil,
and indeed it is sometimes even necessary to do it.
But the only useful fight on the long run
is the fight against Evil itself.
And it is the fight in which fewest people actually participate.
As Henry D. Thoreau put it:

Compromising on results is a necessity of life:
the moral choice of the best of available opportunities
is constrained by the set of available opportunities.
Fighting the manifestations of evil is thus an everyday endeavour,
that will always exist, that can never fully succeed.
It is a part of life.
But it is not the cause that we are specifically defending.
Any results achieved while fighting the manifestations of evil
are short-lived when the original evil is untouched and keeps
spawning ever more subtle new manifestations.
The cause we are defending, the cause of Freedom,
requires us to dissipate evil at its very source.
This is why we cannot compromise on our goals, on our discourse.

it is abandoning the very cause of freedom that we ought to defend

we must understand enough of this illness and its mechanisms.
We must understand how it works, and what efficient countermeasures there are.
We must understand how it spreads, and how we can best prevent contamination.
In other words, we must approach this problems with the White Magic attitude

this engineering includes successfully marketing the engineered memes.

And there are good reasons to be optimistic in the long run.
First, remember that Black Magic can exist but as a parasite to White Magic.
Black Magic may always appear to be winning, dominating, etc.
But deep down inside, White Magic is always the strongest.
It is up to us to make this strength prevail in the open.
One way to see Black Magic is as a parasite meme;

we may say, to paraphrase Einstein, that like the measles,
it is an infantile illness of mankind. 
We may then hope that we'll find good medication
to cure this polymorphous evil.
Then again, looking at things on a grand scale,
we may actually consider that Black Magic is a relic of the past,
a gangue of mud out of which Mankind is quickly emerging
&mdash; quickly in evolutionary timescales.
</p
><p align="justify">
Indeed, at evolutionary scales,
social interaction has long been limited to coordinating common interests
against predators and preys, and otherwise managing
the intrinsic conflicts of interests between tribal group members.
What the conscious mechanisms of thought were used for
was recognizing friends and foes, preys and predators.
Nature took care of all the engineering,
through innate mechanical reflexes, internal biochemical processes, etc.
Black Magic was the only kind of thought.
The design of dynamic strategies of social interaction
for hunting, escaping predators, reproducing, warring,
is novel in evolutionary times.
And modern man is unique in using conscious design of dynamic strategies
to domesticate nature, to build new structures, to invent tools.
This ability of dynamic thinking, of conscious engineering
<a name="footnoteref95"></a

is the distinctive trait of Mankind:
It is the criterion to distinguish the human being from his animal ancestors.
It is the criterion by which we are superior to them,
and by which our descendants will hopefully be superior to us.
It is also the very principle of White Magic.
White Magic is thus as a great but relatively novel thing.

Black Magic is a remnant trace

Actually, I realized, a few days after I gave this conference,
that this light is not that new.
Indeed, Karl Hess briefly mentions magic thinking as the force behind politics
in the conclusion of his 1969 article

<blockquote>
... politics is just another form of residual magic in our culture &mdash;
a belief that somehow things come from nothing;
that things may be given to some without first taking them from others;
that all the tools of man's survival are his by accident or divine right
and not by pure and simple inventiveness and work.</blockquote

Bastiat himself in the

reckons that artificial organization is based on deceptions that falsely
appeal to the religious instinct of man.

A common confusion at this point is to fail to distinguish
``government´´ as a monopoly of force
from ``government´´ as an organization of force.
In this essay, we are using the word ``government´´ in the first meaning,
that of a monopoly of force.
``Government´´ in the second meaning,
that is, organization of force, always exists,
just like ``the market´´ always exists;
it may be simple or complex, it may be structured in a variety of ways,
but there is no question being ``for´´ or ``against´´ it;
the question is about individuals being free or subjected,
about there being monopolies and privileges, or there being a free market.
Libertarians support freedom,
in the way that force is organized
just like in all other matters.

In turn, collectivists may rightfully challenge individualists to justify
why they accept individuals as the limit of their theory of rights.
Incidentally, the answer is given in
the etymology of the very word ``individuals´´:
entity that cannot be divided.
Individuals are by definition the elementary unit
to which liberty and responsibility apply.
As far as social interrelations matter,
you can't meaningfully treat parts of a same human being independently
or many individuals indivisibly.
If you try, then experience will prove you wrong,
as (for instance) teaching some behaviour to one human in a group
won't mechanically teach any other group members,
whereas you can't influence the behaviour of the live part of a human body
without affecting the rest of the body (if only because said body
must be at the same place as the part you handle, or else must be
seriously taken care of in the intensive care unit of a hospital).
Now, if by some currently mysterious feat of technology or psychology,
you manage to split the individuality of a human,
or to tie the individualities of many,
then you will have moved the lines of
individuality without invalidating the concept.
But to achieve this feat, wishful thinking won't be enough;
just decreeing the left and right half of a human as two individuals,
or a whole nation as one, a mere magical incantation won't suffice:
you must effectively establish how these two halves learn independently
from independent experience;
how this nation has a coherent will wherein
all parts inherently behave in a congruently coordinated way
toward a common end.

In Economics, an externality is the side-effect of an action
that concerns third parties not involved in the action.
The externality is said to be
negative if the effect is detrimental to the third parties,
and positive if the effect is beneficial to the third parties.
</p
><p align="justify"><a name="footnote12"></a
><a href="#footnoteref12">[12]</a
>: 
The idea that externalities were not solved by government but concentrated,
I found first explicitly stated in Bryan Caplan's
<a href="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm"><i>Anarchism Theory FAQ</i
></a
>.
</p
><p align="justify">
Actually, governments <em>create</em
> new externalities.
Indeed, an externality always corresponds to
either the lack of definition of a formal property right,
or to the lack of enforcement of an existing property right,
or to the contradictory enforcement of overlapping property rights.
In as much as governments coercively impose their monopoly on
the definition and enforcement of new and old property rights,
they are the cause of any lasting externality.
Governments prevent the use of natural mechanisms
by which property rights emerge and externalities disappear:
homesteading and the common law.
Whenever government defines a rights protection policy
or lack thereof, it makes the protection services stray away
from what market forces would lead to, overprotecting some properties,
and underprotecting other properties.
It thus creates monopolies and hidden protectionist subsidies
to the overprotected privileged ones,
and at the same time creates the Tragedy of the Commons 
and a hidden taxation to the underprotected victims of its policies
&mdash; in both cases, it generates a dynamics of plunder,
whereby people are incited to lobby for ever more protection,
all the while being discouraged from respecting underprotected properties,
so that these underprotected properties will be more and more overexploited.
</p
><p align="justify">
As for the way externalities are treated by governments,
it is remarkable that in democracies,
protectionist laws against political competition from  emerging parties
are welcome as a way to secure that the will of the people will prevail,
and to guarantee the ``power of the people´´
against the ``power of money´´ and covert lobbies.
Actually, political protectionism
increases the power of the established parties over the people,
and replaces public campaigning based on the interest of the people
with private lobbying based on the interests of the established politicians
and of those who can have them vote protectionist laws in their interest
(or have to pay racket protection to the politicians
for the politicians not to vote laws against their interest).
What the collectivists are actually doing is
to replace private people responsibly launching public advertisement campaigns
with shadow agencies lobbying political powers that be,
and with irresponsible political parties directing propaganda at the public.
Now, private advertisers can be sued for fraud
if they breach their promises;
they must fund their campaign on the expected
marginal increase in the revenues of their own legitimate activity.
On the contrary, the political advertisers constantly lie;
they fund their campaign with taxes levied on the population
and with the sale of protectionist favors to various political lobbyists.
Thus once again, politics does not remove the ``problems´´ of a free society,
but actually concentrates them and amplifies them.

In Game Theory, simple mathematical ``games´´
such as the prisoner's dilemma or the ``chicken´´ race,
model situations
where there is a potential benefit for players
in finding a way to coordinate their action.
All the ``theorems´´ about each of such games
merely restate in formal terms
the informal hypotheses that were put in the considered model.
It certainly does not follow that <em>government</em
>
is the right way to achieve this coordination
&mdash; though such is precisely the <i>non sequitur</i
> claim of statists.
Actually, it is possible to apply game theory
to compare coordination through government coercion
with coordination through market competition;
and this exercise in game theory will easily show how dreadful
the effects of government intervention are.
</p
><p align="justify">
Coordination is not something that magically happens, without cost,
by divine intervention, just because the playing parties agree
that coordination would be a good thing if it happened.
And if it did, no coordinator would be required to begin with.
Coordination is thus a service, and this service is worth
whatever benefit the coordinated players get
that they would not get if left uncoordinated.
There remains to determine the most cost-effective way
to achieve this coordination
&mdash; assuming there exists such a cost-effective way.
</p
><p align="justify">
In a free market,
the playing parties are free to choose a coordinator.
Their interest will thus be to find a coordinator
that will provide the best value for his cost.
If there exists a service provider that can indeed bring coordination
at a cost less than what coordination is worth,
then the interests of all concerned
will converge toward this coordination happening.
If the costs of enforcing coordination
actually overwhelm the benefits of this coordination,
then the interests of all concerned
will converge toward this coordination not happening.
All in all, the free market,
i.e. the freedom for the players to choose who will coordinate if anyone,
ensures that coordination will happen if it is good, at the best cost.
</p
><p align="justify">
Let us now consider the case of government as a coordinator.
Just like any private service provider
&mdash; for government is made of private individuals,
just like any institution &mdash;
government is a player that will maximize its interests.
The only thing that distinguishes government from a free market coordinator
is that government detains the means of coercion,
with which it can exclude or discourage any competing service providers.
Thus, at equilibrium, a government will monopolize the coordination of a game;
it will then reap off most benefits of the game,
leaving the players with just what it takes for them
to make the game profitable.
In an opt-in situation, where people have the choice to either
call for government coordination or relinquish coordination,
the government will leave to the players barely more profits
than the ambient marginal interest rate
(with respect to stakes invested in the game)
&mdash; and that only if this cooperation proves profitable to all concerned
despite the monopoly cost of government.
Things are much worse in an opt-out situation,
where a government can coerce people
into accepting its protection services for some pattern of activities.
In such situation, government will not only reap out
all the benefits of coordination,
but will <em>also</em
> go further and charge a surcharge
that makes players worse off than if they had not played.
This surcharge will indeed increase until it reaches
the marginal interest rate for the transaction costs
of opting out of government intervention
(by emigrating, going into civil disobedience, hiding into clandestinity,
lobbying the established powers to promote one's interest,
seizing political power democratically, making a revolution, or whatever).
And the more powerful the government,
the higher are both this cost and the interest rate.
</p
><p align="justify">
In the end, what game theory proves &mdash; if that was needed at all &mdash;
is that coercive power benefits whoever holds it
to the detriment of whoever endures it &mdash; which isn't exactly big news.
Actually, game theory is but a way to formalize things in mathematical terms,
but can say nothing less and nothing more than could be said without it.
The same common sense reasoning that is required to see how the
qualitative mathematical formalism does or does not map to reality
can be used directly to reason about reality,
without the intermediate mathematical jargon.
As usual, mathematics is used in a pseudo-scientific way
to inspire awe in people who are presented with complex-looking models.
This awe is used to hide the fact that the very same old fallacies
are being presented but with a different vocabulary.
Oh, and by the way, as far as argument from authority goes,
I am a mathematician born and raised in a family of mathematicians.
</p
><p align="justify"><a name="footnote14"></a
><a href="#footnoteref14">[14]</a
>: 
Now, the very notion of the government allocating splits of the common good,
and excluding people from it are contradictory
to the premises that were meant
to justify government intervention to begin with.
The allocation of quotas, the rationing, the toll booths, etc.,
set up by the government
prove that the ``common good´´ was not indivisible after all.
The exclusion measures taken by the government,
such as immigration control or compulsory birth control,
or the surveillance of land by armed forces,
prove that exclusion from the goods is possible.
All the alleged impossibilities about exclusion
are but bad excuses to justify conferring to the government
a monopoly on the actually possible power of exclusion.
</p
><p align="justify">
Maybe exclusion is indeed impossible without the use of armed force,
but the only reason why the use of armed forces
seems impossible without government
is because the premise
that government should have a monopoly on the use of armed force
was silently posited, from the outset, in a hugely circular reasoning:
government should have a monopoly on some goods,
because it has the monopoly of force
&mdash; which original sin of a monopoly
is admitted as necessary without justification.
Once again, the government is supposed to be made of superior people,
or to have some magic pixie dust,
that enables it to do what is admitted to be impossible to mere mortals.
And once again, we find that in the end,
the magic pixie dust is nothing but the power of legal coercion
&mdash; brute force.
</p
><p align="justify">
Now, as nicely remarked by Pascal Salin,
having the monopoly to decide who to accept or to exclude
about the use of some good
is by very definition the property right on said good;
what governments actually claim under false pretense
is thus the expropriation of property from its legitimate owners,
to confer it to an illegitimate political body.
The claims of impossibility are just a trick of prestidigitation,
and it is not externalities that have been shifted and concentrated:
it is actually property rights that have been stolen and concentrated
into the hands of the politically strong of the moment.
</p
><p align="justify"><a name="footnote15"></a
><a href="#footnoteref15">[15]</a
>: 
The fallacious argument goes that when there is an extraordinary catastrophe
in a particular field, then government intervention
is necessary to save that field, at least until the issue clears up,
and then to intervene permanently to prevent further catastrophes.
But how does legal coercion actually help with saving people
and helping them recovering their situation?
If government already exists and has special powers of clairvoyance,
why didn't it prevent the previous catastrophe, to begin with?
If it couldn't prevent it, why would it be able to better avoid the next one?
Finally, if some occasional catastrophes in the private sector
justify taking management out of the hands of private people,
don't the permanent catastrophes in the public sector
justify taking management
out of the hands of government?
And in whose hands should things then be?
The hands of a super-government?
The hands of God?
</p
><p align="justify">
A variant of the argument says that
it is their special importance to the collectivity
(national independence, national self-sustenance and some such),
that make it necessary to manage some goods collectively
by fear of mismanagement.
But by considering any good or service collectively,
rather than individually,
just everything can be of ``national importance´´.
Rothbard showed in
<a href="http://www.mises.org/power&#38;market/power&#38;market.pdf"><i>Power and Market</i
></a
>,
that this was a fallacy of average collective choice,
as substituted to the correct reasoning in terms of marginal individual choice:
If there were suddenly
no more light bulbs, no more toilet paper, no more wheat,
or no more hairdressers, no more bridge operators, no more toilet cleansers,
then the nation would be in a sorry state indeed.
But that doesn't mean we have to collectivize any of these operations.
Indeed, the sudden disappearance of these goods or services
doesn't correspond to any imaginable real-life event in the free market.
As long as each patron of each of these activities is ready
to pay a marginally profitable price for a marginal increment of the activity
&mdash; i.e. as long as the activity is worth it at all &mdash;,
then there will be people ready to provide the service for a profit.
On the contrary, the only way that such operations could be put collectively
in danger is precisely by their being collectively managed,
so that bad decisions by the central administrator can ruin the whole industry.
</p
><p align="justify"><a name="footnote16"></a
><a href="#footnoteref16">[16]</a
>: 
For instance, in democracies, ``the people´´ is to be coerced
to do what it is alleged to want to do
but is blatantly admitted to not want at all, to begin with
(or else, it wouldn't need to be coerced).
Indeed, if, say, 50.1% of the population wanted to fund
this or that other insurance, charity, research project, army, etc.
then there's no doubt that
said insurance, charity, research project, army, etc.,
will be abundantly funded, without the need for coercion.
In a free society, each of the ``public´´ goods
that a majority of the people want to fund,
and even those goods that only a minority wants to fund,
<em>will</em
> be funded, by people who care,
confiding their money to people that <em>they</em
> &mdash; caring people &mdash;
deem able to best provide these goods.
That is, each ``public good´´, charity, or whatever,
will be controlled by those responsible people who are most interested in it.
In contrast, in a democracy, these goods are actually controlled
by a class of politicians and public administrators,
who are not checked by people who do care,
but by a vast mass of people who don't care;
most people are disinterested in any particular ``public good´´ or charity,
and won't vote for one of the two main parties
(those who have a chance of forming a government)
on the basis of any particular issue.
Finally, the knowledge that they will have to pay for something
on which they have little control anyway makes them cease to care:
they are made irresponsible, deprived from any will,
by the very system that claims legitimacy
from their responsibility and their will.
</p
><p align="justify">
Similarly, a nation or collective can be good only in as much as
people gladly identify with it;
coercing people into some policies
will only make them less prone to identify with it:
though they may submit to the compulsory public role-play
of abstract patriotism,
they will actually retreat to their personal interest,
and sever  their direct ties with the actual people
of nearby or larger neighborhood.
Compulsory forms of nationalism and collectivism only replace
genuine concrete love of one's neighbor
by hypocritical appearance of love of an abstract entity,
that only hides fear of the Power,
and indifference, despise or hatred toward other people.

Example deeds which make this double standard obvious:
stopping people at arbitrary points along roads,
forcing them to humiliate themselves,
and levying a ``fee´´ on riches they carry
or sending them back where they came from;
forging currency is claimed to be backed on riches one owns but isn't really;
compelling people into using such currency;
threatening to rob, detain or kill people who do things that displease one,
and enforcing one's threats if they do not abide by one's wishes;
offering people ``offers they cannot refuse´´
to sell them service they don't want, with a non-satisfying quality,
at a price they can't negociate;
forcing people to spend their money, their lives, etc.,
in a war they don't want, waged in a way of which they disapprove.
The only difference between these criminals and government agents
is the official seal,
this magic pixie dust that creates legitimacy when it is sprinkled
over the worst crimes, including mass killings.

This superstition was once characterized in the case of democracy
with the following well-known quip:
<blockquote>
Majority, <i>n.</i
>:
	That quality that distinguishes a crime from a law.
</blockquote
></p
><p align="justify">

Behind this double-standard is the fallacy of
<a href="http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html"><i>What Is Seen And What Is Not Seen</i
></a
>:
the statists will count only the ``positive effects´´ of intervention
on people who benefit from it and conspicuously forget to count
the negative effects on people who suffer from it
&mdash; and this fallacy is successful
because the benefits are concentrated, whereas the costs are spread.
Although the fallacy is most often used in this crude form,
when confronted to its substance,
statists will go a long way toward sweeping their fallacy
behind the veil of complexity.
</p
><p align="justify">
For instance, if faced with the absurdity of their broken window argument,
they will quickly retreat toward a ``differential´´ version of it.
In this differential version, they acknowledge
that government's coercive interventions don't magically institute
a spontaneous generation of goods for free,
and that government services are to be paid at a hefty price;
but then they promptly assert that
irresponsible government officials endowed with coercive power
can somehow take better decisions than responsible citizens
(probably thanks to some magic moral purification
that is brought by their coercive power).
The underlying argument is still the very same magic creation of riches
through coercive destruction
&mdash; but it has been pushed back behind a thickening veil of complexity.
And of course, when an increasing complexity
makes arguments either way inconclusive,
they will victoriously claim that their case was established,
by petition of principle.
</p
><p align="justify">
Keynesians take the fallacy one step further:
when faced with sufficient evidence
(which they will never be honest enough to be the first to bring forward),
they will not deny that the way their equations are utter nonsense
when applied to meaningful, understandable, quantities.
They will just evade the obvious falsity of their equations
as applied to any understandably meaningful measurements,
by claiming that their equations should only be applied
to special ``aggregate´´ measurements
blessed as such by keynesian economists.
In a word, they claim to be high-priests of a religion
the tenets of which are obviously absurd when inspected,
but they claim a monopoly on interpreting their magical equations,
and evade criticism by complexifying the question.
</p
><p align="justify"><a name="footnote18"></a

>: 
Indeed, the very corrupting nature of power will attract to it
people who do not have the scruples to refrain from using it,
and drive even the honest leaders into being
self-righteous aristocratic tyrants.
This process was remarkably described by Friedrich A. Hayek
in his excellent book <i>The Road to Serfdom</i
>.
Meanwhile, coercion will spread not only suffering,
but also physical and mental apathy, moral and psychological retreat,
among those who are deprived from the choice of their life,
plus hypocrisy and servility when they are in contact
with their masters and their master's enforcement administration.

Libertarians are often unduly reproached to worship a
myth of the good savage &mdash;
quite on the contrary,
it is statists who worship the myth of the good statesman.
To quote Edward Abbey,
<blockquote>
Anarchism is founded on the observation that since few men are wise enough
to rule themselves, even fewer are wise enough to rule others.

</p

Actually, it is a common pattern that statists will reproach to libertarians
what is actually a blatant failure of their own way of thinking.
</p
><p align="justify"><a name="footnote19"></a

>: 
Egoism, self-care, is not opposite to altruism, care for others.
Indeed, care for others can mean nothing but support
for these other people's own self-care;
altruism thus verily presupposes, requires, respects and supports
egoism in other people.
Moreover, the psychological basis for altruist behavior
can be but the egoist self-satisfaction derived from cooperating with others.
Some forms of cooperation may appear as ``self-less´´ to external observers
who neglect to take psychology into account;
but to a consistent utilitarian, even the most ``self-less´´ attitudes
are really egoistic once non-material gratifications are taken into account
(and ultimately, all gratifications are psychological, not material).
</p
><p align="justify">
Thus, this fallacy is based on a deep misunderstanding of utilitarianism.
This misunderstanding tries to separate
the altruism in people from their ``self-interest´´,
and pretend that only government
can take advantage of this altruism
and limit the ``evilness´´ of self-interest.
But in a proper utilitarian setting
(as opposed to the caricatures of it
used by statist economists and philosophers),
``self-interest´´
will already account for the interactions with other people.
For a given personal ``utility´´,
one doesn't want either other people's utility or disutility in addition to it;
possible love and hate are already included in personal utility functions;
utility already includes the physical and psychological benefits
from cooperation with others and other ``altruist´´ behavior.
The correct utilitarian stance is one of <em>mutualism</em
>,
where people can, will, actually did, do, and will continue to
adopt rules of cooperative conducts out of their own self-interest.
The usual lot of fallacies on the subject, and their debunking,
have all been well treated by Henry Hazlitt in his book:
<a href="http://www.hazlitt.org/e-texts/morality/"><i>The Foundations of Morality</i
></a
>,
that extracts the quintessence of the achievements
of classical anglo-saxon moralists, and corrects their mistakes.
</p
><p align="justify">
Thus, altruism, in its mutualistic form,
is already included in personal self-interest.
Not only cannot government increase total utility
by magically unleashing a secret source of altruism in people;
but government can and will only act in an altruist way
if it is actually controlled by the altruist tendency in people,
which must preexist to any altruism by government.
Government is not a superhuman source of altruism,
but can only give back the human altruism that was successfully put into it.
And then again, nothing warranties that this altruism rather than antagonism
will dominate the coercitive apparatus of the state.
On the contrary, by concentrating coercive power,
government is a great incentive
for people without scruples to strive toward seizing power,
whereas really altruistic people won't partake in the struggle for power.

Thus, contrary to the implicit prejudice behind this fallacy,
governments only ever manage things on the short run.
Indeed, the horizon of foresight of any political party is
the next elective mandate.
If ever one politician wanted to see further than the rest,
his party would soon remind him of his duties toward it;
political parties that do not force politicians to think in the short run
get quickly wiped out of significance by parties that do;
politicians without a political party simply don't get elected;
and since even ``good´´ political parties can't remain in power very long,
even if their policies are oriented toward the long term,
these policies will be changed with next government.
In conclusion, politics mean that whatever is politically managed
will be led by short term demagoguery.

Technocratic administrative bodies, in as much as they last longer than governments,
may act on the long term &mdash;
but then, unchecked by any ``democratic control´´,
and moved around by governmental directives
as far as their official role is concerned,
the only consistent direction in which they act in the long run is
the interest of the administration members themselves:
excessive wages and outrageous ``work conditions´´,
protectionist measures against change or competition
either internal or external,
political power given to official labor unions,
continuous extension of the ``duties´´ (i.e. powers) of the administration,
etc.
All that to the detriment
of the citizens being ``served´´ what they don't want,
of the taxpayers having to fund an administration they don't like,
of the potential competitors and innovators,
forced to bankruptcy or prevented from existing (if external)
or compelled into following the hierarchically-imposed way (if internal)
&mdash; and even of most members of the administration,
who have to bear with a rigid hierarchy that makes them
as hapless as useless.

The real force toward positive long-term planning has always
been private interest of foresighted people.
Private pension funds typically consider interests over decades
(and it is typical that collectivists will be angry at pension funds,
because they are precisely the way by which freedom turns
the salarymen  into the greatest capitalist force in the world,
instead of the slaves that they collectivists want workers to remain).
Banks, despite their being made largely irresponsible
by the statist central banking system,
also typically invest with decades of foresight,
and used to invest with one hundred years of planning.
Established families typically invested several centuries in advance,
before the governments completely destroyed the incentives:
the estate tax destroyed long-term family planning for physical property,
and the state education destroyed it for intellectual tradition.

For instance, let us consider
the limits to the jurisdiction of a government.
Statists will argue that it is the number of persons to which laws apply
that makes the effectiveness of laws and limits their utility,
they then deduce, firstly that uniformity is good,
and secondly that governments are the only good way to achieve uniformity,
and thirdly that governments must be as large as possible.
</p
><p align="justify">
Firstly, they suppose that laws are forcibly good
&mdash; whereas laws may be bad.
But, let us suppose that for some reason,
some given laws are to be considered as good.
Now, they are not such an absolute good
that everything must be sacrificed to them,
including the life of every single man, woman and child on earth.
This good is comparable to other goods,
and the costs involved in achieving this good
are comparable to the costs involved in achieving other goods.
Therefore, this good is not sacred,
and choosing whether to pursue it or not, and in which way,
is but one another of the moral choices that are part of every man's life.
Whether it is more or less urgent
than other goals is a question to be examined.
And another question worthy of simultaneous examination is
the means to achieving this good.
</p
><p align="justify">
A special mention must be made about the notion of uniformity
that is often invoked by statists at this point.
Uniformity is not good per se.
A bad law uniformly enforced on the whole wide world is extremely bad.
A change toward uniformity can be bad,
if it comes from worsening the law at some place to make it
conform to widely accepted bad law.
A change toward disuniformity can be good,
if it means better law somewhere freeing some people from universal slavery.
Uniformity doesn't directly matter;
it is not a goal worthy of pursuit,
and not even a proxy for a goal worthy of pursuit.
Similarly, a change toward equality by the dissemination of poverty is bad,
whereas a change toward inequality by the creation of riches is good.
</p
><p align="justify">
Secondly, even though some laws may be good,
this does not justify the use of coercion to impose them upon other people.
Indeed, the use of governmental coercion supposes that an evil
much larger than the good being spread is at work behind the coercion
&mdash; and this unleashed evil is prone to enforcing evil laws
and corrupting even good laws, rather than to promoting good laws.
The extension of the jurisdiction of good laws and good institutions is good;
but in theory as well as in practice,
the only laws and institutions the jurisdiction of which coercion can extend
are those that are so bad that people won't voluntarily support them.
</p
><p align="justify">
All in all, even though sometimes, widely accepted good laws may be good,
statists still fail to make any point considering
either the goodness of the particular laws they wish to promote,
or the relative desirability of extending the acceptance of these laws,
or the means of extending this acceptance,
or the process by which governmental coercion can be confined
into contributing positively rather than negatively to all these problems.
In short, there is no problem, and government is not the solution;
statists are but basing their claim on a double petition of principle.
</p
><p align="justify">
Liberty and Responsibility are the only possible warranty
that people will choose to obey good laws rather than bad laws.
Peaceful persuasion through rhetorics filtered by critical reasoning
and demonstrable benefits is the only way that good habits, good laws,
and good institutions can be durably spread among the population,
while at the same time discarding bad habits, bad laws and bad institutions.

At this point, the vocabulary and concepts of Memetics can help us.
Memetics, introduced by Richard Dawkins
in his book <i>The Selfish Gene</i
>,
and extensively developed afterwards by many people
(see the <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/">Principia Cybernetica Project</a
>),
is the study of <i>memes</i
>,
patterns of thought that can be spread from people to other people.
</p
><p align="justify">
Memes evolve by natural selection,
for they survive in as much as people voluntarily embrace them,
according to their (well- or ill-) understood self-interest.
Of course, people embracing them
may be <em>wrong</em
> about their self-interest,
and indeed, memes can survive and spread by systematically
deceiving people about their self-interest.
</p
><p align="justify">
Knowing that, one must beware to avoid using the following justification
as an explanation of the success of some ideas:
``these ideas have success because
they are in their believers' perceived self-interest´´.
Indeed, such an argument would be a circular reasoning.
Though it may be true in the particular case considered,
it would be but a <i>post hoc</i
> tautology,
an affirmation that is generic to all memes
and cannot explain and distinguish the dynamics of specific memes.
</p
><p align="justify">
In other words, it is sometimes good to remind general statements,
whenever there is general ignorance and confusion about them,
but they cannot replace a specific study of the topic at hand.

Thus, according to this theory,
people who have interest in some government intervention
will profitably lobby for this intervention;
and they won't even have to lie for that,
for their interest will make them the first
to believe their own arguments.
</p
><p align="justify">
Now, so that a meme of exploitation may survive,
it must also ensure the cooperation of the victims of the exploitation.
Therefore, interventions that will be successful
are interventions that even victims won't have marginal interest in leaving;
and they won't, because the cost of individual secession will be too high.
There will then be an apparent paradox about victims
having the <em>marginal</em
> interest in not to do anything against oppression,
despite oppression being very detrimental to them <em>on the average</em
>.
This paradox can be exemplified as follows,
with the principle of
``take five (unconditionally) and give back four (conditionally)´´.
Government might make it certain that (unless it is overthrown)
5 units of goods will be taxed away from normal (exploited) citizens,
whereas citizens will conditionally receive 2 units back if they don't resist,
and maybe even 4 if they are active accomplices of government.
Thus, even though on the average,
government is always detrimental to all their citizens,
costing them 1 unit of riches in the best case
of their actively defending the system,
the marginal case for a citizen to support the government
will be a gain of 2 for those who simply don't resist,
and a gain of 4 for those who become active accomplices.
</p
><p align="justify">
Of course, to maintain such a discrepancy
between marginal interest and average interest,
government must ensure that taxation remains certain,
whereas its subsidies will remain conditional.
(As said Benjamin Franklin:
``In this world nothing is certain but death and taxes.´´)
The ultimate danger to a government is civil disobedience:
people massively refusing to cooperate,
and the government not being able to enforce its political decisions anymore,
&mdash; with its own agents refusing to enforce its edicts against people,
and people being ready to fight back against anyone trying to enforce them.
That's why governments will actively campaign
to prevent their opponents from coordinating an overthrow:
constant propaganda through media and education control,
harassment of potential high-profile dissenters,
denial of working conditions, hefty fines and imprisonment
for those who do not cooperate with the system
(which begins with paying taxes), etc.
Measures of this kind are necessary
to keep the government exploitation going;
and these measures may end up eating most of what
governments manage to plunder away from their citizens.
Note that in democratic countries,
one of the measures used to settle the power
is to encourage opposing parties that are as statist
as the ruling party or more so even,
so that the only plausible change
will be favorable to the principle of the established power,
and thus to the running party that expects
to gain back someday the power it may lose
and to continue to take its share of the political loot
in the many constituencies where it will remain strongest.
</p
><p align="justify">
When quasi-certainty is acquired in the mind of some people,
they will have no marginal interest in learning
about alternative high-cost low-probability possibilities;
they will be ``rationally ignorant´´ of any dissenting idea.
When in addition, these people somehow get benefits
from being the displayed accomplice of government intervention
(social advancement, avoided or reduced harassment,
psychological relief from the feeling of being a victim,
etc.)
then they will be ``rationally irrational´´
and they will actively believe in the very propaganda
that maintains them under an oppressive regime.
</p
><p align="justify">
Note that in these two expressions, ``rationally´´ refers
to the concept of rationality used by economists:
the fact that the preferences revealed by people's actual behavior
are congruent with each one's idea of his own interests,
and remain so as one's ideas evolve.
In contrast, in the second expression, ``irrational´´ refers
to a more casual use of the word, denoting the attitude of having beliefs
that do not pass the soundness filter of simple logic.

The realization that lobbying will waste in advance exactly the benefits
of any putative form of government subsidy was made (at least for me)
by François Guillaumat, in a personal communication.

<a href="http://fare.livejournal.com/32611.html">Political Welfare is Pure Waste</a

</p

Of course, this equality is asymptotic.
In as much as the means to lobby are specific,
they can't be converted from existing industries,
and they can't be reinvested in other industries
&mdash; they are a sunk capital investment.
A corollary is that
the existence of political power creates converging interests
for people having invested in such capital,
to maximize the profitability of this capital,
and thus to continuously extend power in place.

Some Public Choice theorists
distinguish in political entrepreneurship the two activities of
milking existing potential and lobbying toward the public opinion
to create new potential.
But these two activities are not separable in practice,
because as far as self-interested behavior is concerned,
political exploiters do not have exploitation in general as their goal,
so much as exploitation to their own benefit.
</p
><p align="justify">
Actually, people who feel deeply attached to political ideologies
may lobby for more governmental intervention in general,
&mdash; but as far as the dynamics of political entrepreneurship is concerned,
these people as such are part of the potential to be tapped,
rather than of the entrepreneurs tapping the potential.
Of course, people who are (or think they are)
in the beneficial side of the exploitation
have interest in spreading such ideologies,
and the best way for them to do it
is to genuinely believe in such ideologies, to begin with
(feeling righteous is also essential for them to sleep well at night).
</p
><p align="justify">
As for the remark on people who ``think they are´´
on one side of exploitation,
political lobbying, just like all scams,
will of course consist at least partly
in making people think they benefit from oppression,
even though most of them actually suffer from it.
Indeed, as scam artists put it:
``if you don't know who's the sucker, how he will be fooled,

then you're probably the sucker yourself.´´

However, since their very existence will then be at stake,
we must expect political entrepreneurs to keep up

Once again, the <i>Ad Hoc</i

that there is no reason to consider that their collectivity is the right one
to take any specific decision.
Why not a bigger or smaller or different collectivity?
There obviously isn't a universe-wide government,
yet humans manage to coordinate mostly without wars and conflicts.
People peacefully engage in international commerce and tourism
without the need of a common international government to coordinate them.
If anything, political behavior <em>causes</em
> wars and conflicts
where economical behavior entails peace and cooperation.
The right solution to the problem
of determining the shape and size of collectivities
is that the right collectivities
are those that people freely adhere to
&mdash; and such collectivities have no particular reason to be territorial
(although physical proximity between people might play a role
in helping people coordinate,
which role gets smaller and smaller as means of telecommunication develop).
</p
><p align="justify">
In the line of statists reproaching libertarians
both something and its opposite,
we can see how the collectivists who lament
about the impossibility of doing anything big without government intervention
denounce the ``intolerable power of multinationals´´
whenever anything big is <em>actually</em
> done
without government intervention (which disproves their point).
Then, they claim
they want this ``power´´ checked by governmental intervention,
or completely replaced by governmental intervention.
It's really a religious war that collectivists are waging:
the real thing they reproach deep down in their heart

from then on, your mere existence is an insult to them,

If anyone not blessed with the divine power of government

The very idea of trading liberty for security is a contradiction.
It is a ``sign error´´ in a basic equation of human behavior.
To give a dealer the unlimited right to decide for his customers

the agent remains at the service of the principals.
``Yeah, it'd be great if the agent would still serve us

Note about the above word ``refraint´´:
Hazlitt regretted that the word ``refraint´´ (self-imposed constraint)

Well, he was wrong:
all the words exist and have the meaning(s) we agree to give to them.
He didn't hesitate to create the word ``utilism´´, after all
(to cut through the accumulation of ending syllables in ``utilitarianism´´

We thus see that even with neutral technical terms,
words can already be misleading.
How much more misleading can ideologically laden words be!
Using words in such a way as to imply a lot of its ideology,

This general relationship between parents and children
evolved into its current existence by natural selection
because it indeed is mutually beneficial to parents and young children;
such a relationship allows to provide for individuals
and to invest capital in their human beings

So the pattern has some good use.
But it also has some bad abuse.
And indeed, this blind trust in parents dissolves
as children mature and become responsible adults.
The problem is conspicuously not in the blind trust of young infants,

The common consensus nowadays is that parents cannot go so far

Now, as to establishing precise limits to the authority of parents,
legislation doesn't promote liberty of action

On the contrary, many libertarians argue that
parental authority is largely unnecessary and unjustified;
parents are not entitled to coerce their children

would not deserve any special authority for that.

The measures taken to prevent people from using reason
are to build a wall of strong emotions around the issue to avoid.
A primary set of measures is to use
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Hills/9267/fuddef.html">FUD tactics</a
> to instill fear of any change.
Governmental coercion is thus offered as a guarantee,
the Ultimate guarantee against Evil.
But the only things that the right to coercion warrants
are injustice and evil themselves,
whereas the only possible warrant of good
is the harmony of self-interests
	in a society of freely cooperating individuals.
These tactics are the emotional equivalent
of the Catastrophe-Prevention Fallacy and the Moral Fallacy
discussed above.
Yet they are effective:
people are willing to escape the risk of some bad outcome
by embracing the certainty of the worst possible outcome.
What it takes is making the risk obvious
while hiding the nature of the certainty;
people are risk averse, and they seldom understand
that with liberty, their only risk is to get better.
</p

The other main set of tactics is
to isolate people from each other and prevent them from cooperating,
so as to appeal to the marginal interest of individuals

(Once again, it is striking that statists use game theory arguments
based on government intervention being meant to solve the prisoner's dilemma,
whereas it is precisely governments creating the problem of
a huge nation-wide prisoner's dilemma, to begin with.)
Any emerging competition is to be subjected by force,
or made ineffective by fraud, or to be subverted

Actually, constant political propaganda,
tax-funded religious fervor for political reform,

Bastiat, in his
<a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basSophtoc.html"><i>Economic Sophisms</i
></a
>,
noted that it is impossible to fully follow a false theory:
even the most ardent proponents of collectivist systems in theory
live by the principles of life in their individual practice;
they may apply their false theories more or less,
but they cannot be coherent in applying them, lest they die.
The principles of Life and Truth are coherent,
whereas the principles of Death and Falsity are not
&mdash; actually, it is precisely this coherence
that ultimately characterizes Truth,
and this is the reason why, despite superficial symmetries,
you cannot exchange Life and Death, Truth and Falsity, Good and Evil.
Emotional judgments are in terms of two categories like Friend or Foe;
they are related by symmetrical links of alliance and opposition.
Rational judgments, on the other hand,
though they may look superficially as being
in terms of two symmetrical emotional categories like Truth and Falsity,
are actually based on logical structures of infinitely many categories,
related by intrinsically dissymmetrical links of logical implication.

</p
><p align="justify"><a name="footnote45"></a

>: 
Evil can only parasite good.
The forces of Death can only feed upon Life.
Parasites and predators can never ``win´´ over their victims and preys,
or they would extinguish themselves too.
This is why even the most oppressive regime cannot sustain itself
unless there are more creative forces active in the body of oppressed people
than there are destructive forces used by the oppressors
&mdash; and if these oppressors don't fall before,
these creative forces will ultimately win over them,
though it may take quite a long time for them to win,
during which the destructive forces will cause suffering
and destroy not just material capital,
but even part of the basic psychological capital
that allows for human cooperation.
Libertarians must thus be confident in the far future;
what we are to be concerned about
is how to make progress nearer rather than farther
&mdash; what part we can take in making progress happen.

To a Black Magician,
the relationship to nature and to other people is hierarchical:
there are inferiors and there are superiors;
the Black Magicians displays
violence toward inferiors and subservience toward superiors.
To a White Magician,
the relationship to nature and to other people is not hierarchical:
there is no purpose in establishing categories
of ``superior´´ or ``inferior´´;
what matters is to recognize the various characters of the many alien forces,
to learn to respect them, and to master their use toward the best results.

Schizophrenia is inherent to any theory that isn't equated with practice.
Indeed, when a theory describes a world different from the real world,
it is false, thus it isn't sustainable,
and practice cannot completely and permanently follow theory.
Practice will thus contradict theory,
and there will have to be a breaking point
in any theoretical follower's mind
between the accepted theory and the behaved practice.
Hence, schizophrenia is a sure companion of any lasting false theory.
A typical symptom to diagnose this kind of schizophrenia is
the following piece of pseudo-wisdom,
often uttered with a proud feeling of cleverness by a black magician:
``In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice;
in practice, there is´´.
The black magicians accept as a wise paradox
what would in reason be the sure sign
that their theory is false and should be changed.
Now of course their black magic precisely consists
in not developing theories out of individual reasoning,
and instead submitting to a collective authority so as to adopt a theory.

We already saw in our
<a href="#SUBSECTION_2.1">section about public goods fallacies</a
>
that it was a fraud to pretend that government
could be a source of altruism external to citizens themselves,
and that the only thing that it genuinely introduced was coercion.
We may further our analysis, together with Henry Hazlitt,
and see that egoism as self-love is not only compatible with
altruism as other-love, but also a prerequisite for other-love:
if the one has no self-love, no taste for personal satisfactions,
it is impossible or pointless for others to offer him personal satisfactions.
And indeed, the ``altruist´´ black magicians
do not seek personal satisfactions, but the abolition of them,
and their replacement by ``collective satisfactions´´
as revealed by increasing statistics
and by satisfaction of the political elite regarding
its prowess at managing a submitted society of slaves.
</p
><p align="justify">
Actually, egoism, as self-love, even without other-love, is good,
and is the very
<a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basHar22.html">motive force of society</a
>,
as Bastiat showed.
It is it that makes every man eager to learn, to improve,
to cooperate with other people, etc.
The fallacy is to make believe that personal interests
are intrinsically antagonistic to one another,
whereas they really are in harmony with one another,
in what Hazlitt calls <em>mutualism</em
>.
On the contrary, ``altruism´´ without egoism is evil;
people who don't respect themselves will not be able to respect other people;
people who think other people are wrong to seek personal satisfactions
will happily remove satisfactions from these other people,
and think they have done well.
Actually, altruism is but a pretense for the political elite
to seek its personal satisfactions, while feeling comfortable
in sacrificing the subjected people to official ``altruistic´´ motives.

Black Magicians fail to see cooperation in any dissymmetrical exchange;
they insist that one party unilaterally exploits the other.
Yet purely symmetrical exchange where each one receives
exactly the same thing as he gave, is no gain for anyone,
only a loss of time at exchanging anything.
Thus the ideal of Black Magicians is individual autarky
&mdash; the dissolution of society.
And this is indeed the logical conclusion
of conceiving all human interactions as predation.
</p
><p align="justify">
Quite on the contrary, cooperation is born from dissymmetrical exchange,
where each person, being specialized,
offers what is relatively easier for one to do
and receives what is relatively harder for one to achieve.
In cooperation, people help fulfill each other's potential.
An artist has a talent useful for some part in some attraction,
but none for prospection, marketing and sale,
he looks for an impresario &mdash; the best he can find,
to do this job for him.
The impresario in turn looks for the best actors to promote,
and sells their talent to the best producers he can find.
A producer gathers a pool of the best talents, each useless in isolation,
to produce the best show, to sell to the best customers.
And the public in turn is ready to pay for some piece of entertainment
the enjoyment is such that they couldn't have better for cheaper.
Everyone gains from everyone else.
Everyone exploits everyone else.
And everyone is happy about it &mdash; exploitation is good.
Freedom to walk away and to choose with whom to cooperate,
in other words, competitive free markets,
is precisely what guarantees that everyone will be served
as best as he can find, in this mutual exploitation,
the name of which is social cooperation.

Of course our thesis is precisely that
while one of these aspects may be stressed separately
or may be locally separated from the other aspects,
they are inseparable from each other
in our behavior strategies.
Black Magicians hierarchize metaphysics then epistemology then ethics,
with the universe being some data about which you get information
and then inside which you act.
White Magicians know that you can only get information
by interacting with the universe, which in turn modifies the universe,
so that the information flows both ways,

Arguably some don't know it, don't feel it, and don't act. They die.
Genetically, memetically, they are dead ends, quickly wiped away by life.
Relativists will argue that dying might be no less ``good´´ than surviving,
that existing is not better than not existing. Maybe.
But those who are dead, those who don't exist,
things that are not real, are irrelevant.
They don't come and change the outcome of our lives
(though our real ideas of unreal things definitely do).
We live. If you don't, you're out of our scope.
If you don't want to live, go away and die;
you'll be irrelevant while we will focus on things that matter to our lives.
Life is a valid premise to all rational discussions,
because any denial of life is a performative contradiction.

A weaker answer is that even if nothing is more worthwhile than anything else,
then the reply we give is no less worthwhile than any other reply.

as a way to inhibit rationality in others and have their force prevail,

Life is metabolizing external resources.
And this happens not just at the biochemical level,
but also at the social level.
Our better genes and memes survive in as much as they spread their structure.
These structures are to be efficiently
implemented in a competitive environment,
using resources that are external and have a different organization if any;
these resources are used by imprinting them with a proper part
of the internal order of the life form that absorbs them.
The locally anentropic
(some would say <a href="http://www.extropy.org/">``extropic´´</a
>)
transformation of an unknown, ununderstood and maybe unknowable organization
of some resources into a known, understood, friendly pattern
is the characteristic activity of life: metabolization.
</p
><p align="justify">
At the biochemical level, there exist membranes
(cellular membrane, skin, etc.) that separate
the internal world,
made of resources having been transformed
or reserved for upcoming metabolization,
from the external world,
made of resources subject to an external order.
But even these membranes are not absolute, absolutely precise,
uncrossable, unbreakable borders.
Rather, they are self-repairing adaptative limits
that provide an attempt at separating the interior from the exterior
in a productive compromise between efficiency and affordability.
At the social level, property rights are also such membranes,
that identify resources that have been metabolized by people
who have transformed them or have reserved them for an ongoing transformation.
Homesteading, the rule attributing resources to those who first use them,
is but the acknowledgement of this process of life at the social level.

At this point, we have to restate how hierarchies and entreprises,
just like Black Magic and White Magic,
are but two poles, two extremes,
and that reality develops in-between.
In our societies of grey magic, corporations and institutions
are typically something in-between ideal hierarchies and ideal entreprises;
even in highly centralized administrations,
individual entrepreneurship is essential to making things happen;
even in highly competitive companies,
the social decision flow is felt by participants and instituted
as a hierarchical relationship.
So here too, there is grey,
and here too, grey is meaningful but by reference to black and white.

The word ``bet´´ above is not to be understood
as a wager in a zero-sum game of mutual predation based on sheer luck,
as in a casino or when gambling on horses.
Quite on the contrary, it is to be understood
as the commitment of resources in a positive-sum game of production,
where wit matters.
And the proof of the wit or lack thereof is precisely
in the wise or unwise commitment of resources.
Those who commit their resources wisely
will get great return for their investment,
whereas those who take bad decisions will lose their stakes and beyond.
What we seek to convey by the word ``bet´´
is the statically uncertain but dynamically valuable nature
of any and all knowledge:
as a static body of information,
knowledge is radically uncertain and worthless;
but as a dynamic basis for adaptation,
knowledge has the value of the adaptative better commited choices

An example is the french law that limits legal work schedules
to a maximum (average) of ``35 hours´´ per week.
The alleged rationale was that working less was a sacrifice
that would allow to ``share´´ the available work
with the currently unemployed.
Moreover, the employers, not the employees,
were asked to pay for the sacrifice.
Of course, for all further jobs, all this means is that the cost of employment
will have risen, so the employer can pay less for a given productivity,
whereas people whose productivity is too low to justify a minimal wage
plus additional costs to the employer, will not get hired.
The net result is thus a raise in unemployment,
as well as a decrease in total wealth being produced, since people work less.
As for existing jobs, then some employees may indeed win in the short term,
but then the employers will face such financial hardship as to go bankrupt;
though in the case of government as an employer,
the taxpayer pays for the bankruptcy
&mdash; and the increased tax pressure shifts bankruptcy onto other companies.
Politicians don't care, as long as they expect this measure

Notice how the very notion of choosing between two evils
is a mix of White Magic and Black Magic:
In White Magic, you have to make choices;
but there is no <i>a priori</i
> notion of evil;
assuming for the sake of the argument that there are but two choices
then all that matters is that, considering all the expected consequences,
including those relative to the acceptance of general rules of behavior,
one is to be preferred to another one,
and thus is <i>ipso facto</i
> better, and the other one worse,
without there being any other relevant scale of Good and Evil.
Of course, in practice things are more complex than having to side
with either of two well-defined camps;
instead the relevant question is to determine
where to spend your marginal resources (including your attention),
which might involve active siding with neither of the two proposed camps.

In Black Magic, there is an absolute Good and an absolute Evil
(though not forcibly under those names)
and having to choose between two Evils is an unexplainable paradox,
a source of pain and sorrow, another reason to revolt against nature.
In practice, the necessity of a choice is acknowledged by Black Magicians,
which is at the same time a tribute to White Magic,
and a formal condemnation of it as Evil.

Working around the contradictions of the system
also offers plenty of room for mindplay
to those who like to exercise their intellect
while accepting the premises of the system.
Only those who refuse to accept incoherent premises
are truly irreducible enemies of Black Magic.

It is thus characteristic that Black Magicians
will put forward morality as the justification of politics,
the proper goal for the use of force;
whatever their politicial leaning, their politics really consists in
as the forceful imposition of a moral order
defined according to their own subjective tastes.
</p
><p align="justify">
In contrast, White Magicians conspicuously separate morality from justice,
and see use of force as justified in matters of justice,
and illegitimate as far as matters of personal morality is concerned;
whatever their personal preferences, their libertarianism really consists in
the enforcement of a lawful order
defined according to objective rules of reason.

Have you never lost anything, for instance your keys,

Apparently, trying to find intent in any event that concerns oneself
is a natural reflex of the human brain.
The brain constantly tries to match the events from the world
into known patterns &mdash; either inborn patterns or acquired patterns.
Now, patterns based on intent are deeply rooted
in the fabric of our brains, consequently to millions of years
of living in societies where intent mattered most:
indeed, our ancestors had to deal with preys and predators
and sexual rivals and partners
that can be readily understood in terms of intent;
they didn't deal with complex technology and social cybernetics
for which intent-based explanations fail.

That's why Black Magic not only tries to cultivate ignorance,
but also and most importantly tries to fill heads with its own hogwash,
so that there be no room left for any true knowledge.
Total education control, permanent media hype, etc.,
are thus essential tools that Black Magic seizes when they exist,
and develops to unprecedented levels.

There is something of an oxymoron in this sentence.
Actually, the entirety of the present essay is an attempt
to turn the manichean imagery of black magic against black magic itself.
Therefore, it may be seen as following the same principle as the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a
>,
that turns against itself the legislation of information protectionism,
or as Aikido, that turns the force of an aggressor against himself.
It is a self-defense technique,
that cannot describe the natural order of things,
but only brings the means to fight its perturbations.
For an effort to go further, see my next speech,
<a href="http://fare.tunes.org/liberty/leiden.html"><i>The Enterprise of Liberty vs The Enterprise of Politics</i
></a
>.
</p
><p align="justify">
As for self-defense,
we are thus using the principle of Evil against itself,
knowing full well that this includes a dynamic contradiction
that is precisely meant to limit, decrease and contain the principle of Evil,
lacking the power to extinguish it.
It will forever remain important to stay vigilant
as to the use of the tools of violence,
whereas these tools will always be necessary
to fight the inevitable resurgences of the coercive principle in the world.
But in this case not less than in other cases,
it is illusory to think that this vigilance and this violence can be spared
by confiding the monopoly of them to an official counter-power
or by unilaterally abandoning the prerogative of them
&mdash; for such a counter-power would soon become the main power itself,
much more powerful than the one it used to keep in check,
whereas this abandonment would be but a total surrender
to those who wouldn't similarly renounce violence.
Remarkably, this is the history of democracy and of pacifism.
Once meant as counter-powers opposed to absolute monarchy,
parliaments nowadays reign, and their own flavor of absolutism
grows without bounds and has several times turned into totalitarianism.
As for pacifism, it only served to lead millions of innocent people
into agonizing death at the claws of great mass murderers.
In short, antagonism and its violent resolution will never cease to exist,
though they will never be the motive power of mankind;
and in such antagonisms, it is better if force
should prevail on the right side than on the wrong side.

The individualization of religion is a meme that historically succeeded
as a symbiot to universal monotheist religions:
it has begun riding on judeo-christianism
when the jewish theocracy lost its power to foreign invaders.
Indeed, after the persian armies conquered Judea,
the jewish prophets were not able anymore
to appeal to political power to enforce their will;
instead they had to resort to convincing individuals
to voluntary abide by their preachings. 
The christian religion, originally spreading in the roman empire against
the will of political power, also had to appeal to people by individual choice.
Liberty rose once again in Europe after the german invasions divided
the roman empire into a great number of kingdoms,
moving the political power away from the christian theocracy
into the hands of the conquering military.
In turn, this <i>de facto</i
> separation of the church from the state
led, through competition, to the development of some freedom of thought,
and gave a competitive advantage to these societies that
supported this separation of church from political power
over those that didn't.
</p
><p align="justify"><a name="footnote94"></a
><a href="#footnoteref94">[94]</a
>: 
This separation was notably theorized by Christian Michel in
<a href="http://www.liberalia.com/htm/cm_obey_laws.htm"><i>Should We Obey The Laws Of Our Country?</i
></a
>, 2000.
The distinction between Morality and Justice is already quite present
in Henry Hazlitt's
<a href="http://www.hazlitt.org/e-texts/morality/"><i>The Foundations of Morality</i
></a
>,
but his inclusion of Justice within Morality
seems cybernetically incorrect to us,
since decisions of morality and of justice
are not taken by the same persons based on the same information:
morality is how each one decides based on the personal information he has;
justice on the other hand, is the result
of the moral interaction of many individuals,
who synchronize their actions based on publicly available information;
it is a social phenomenon
whereby the equilibrium of social forces leads
to the legitimation of violent actions against malefactors recognized as such.

This is why it can be rightly said
that Libertarianism is the only true Humanitarianism.
A true humanitarian can be libertarian and cannot be authoritarian,
for authority degrades man to an savage animal,
whereas liberty upgrades the savage into a civilized man.
Liberty is the very fulfillment of Mankind.
