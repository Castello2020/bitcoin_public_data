		<p>If so, we want you to join with us! We can link our page up to yours. You would have complete control over what confessions get posted to this site, and as soon as you approve them here, with 1 click of a button, the confession would be automatically posted to your Facebook page! The more confessions you receive each day, the more time this would save you. If you are interested, <a href="newschool.aspx">submit your site here</a> and you can be up and running in minutes!</p>

  		<h2 ><span>Frequently Asked Questions</span></h2>
		<b>Are these really anonymous?</b>
		<p>Yes, we can only only see the general location something was sent from(like if it came from China), the only reason for this is to cut down on spam, we all hate it and we do not want you to get it.</p>
		<b>Other sites have facebook comments why don't you?</b>
		<p>Because we want to protect you, and our facebook pages. We integrate with fb pages to help them grow, but we do it in a way that totally separates the user from facebook. We built this so facebook is unable to see who is confessing and what they are confessing. We also have users with out facebook, we want to cater to them too.
	</p>
		<b>What confessions are most likely to get approved?</b>
		<p>The best confessions are the ones that sound the most sincere. If you confess to have slept with every girl in Dorm X, we're probably going to call B.S. and reject your confession. A good confession should also be something you have done or thought but would never want to tell anyone.</p>
		<p>Also, confessions that attack a specific person will not be tolerated. You are welcome to get your frustrations off your chest, but you must refrain from divulging too much detail where the identity of anyone would be revealed. Each school page that is affiliated with a Facebook page has a different admin with different idea of what should make it to their page. But follow these rules and you are probably safe.</p>
		<b>Is there any way I can support you?</b>
		<p>Yes, we are accpeting Bitcoins our address is (1Q74pwHA1RXfchaBjb8YHUCXu24jMyiRUz). </p>
		  <p>We accept DogeCoin (DCEuesGpyAG6zzZESZYsiqdn8Rakfdq1e9)</p>
