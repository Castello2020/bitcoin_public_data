<p>Nutritional value for <strong>1tbsp</strong> of the following:</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh4qosmA3e1qf00w4.png" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>Interestingly, most of the pro-HFCS sites I&#8217;ve read state that HFCS-55% is as sweet as sucrose while HFCS-42% is less sweet than sucrose.  And doing a cursory look on pubmed.gov didn&#8217;t seem to turn anything up.</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh3j04jRKq1qf00w4.png" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>The second table was made from data from the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference found here: <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/">http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/</a> and searching for &#8220;corn&#8221; which lead me to high fructose corn syrup and &#8220;Sucrose&#8221; which led me to granulated sugar.  <strong>Please keep in mind, I could not find the differences in calories and carbohydrates between the two main types of HFCS.  This is what the USDA had to offer data wise.</strong></p>
<p><em>In my original calculations I treated carbs and sugars separately.  This gave me astonishingly wild numbers and thanks to the Savage Circuits crowd and especially @RoyEltham, the new interpretation is &#8220;of the 14.44g carbs in HFCS, 5.01g are sugars&#8221;, for example)</em>.</p>
<p>Some basic definitions:</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong>  The highly useless answer is that nutritional calories are really scientific kilocalories which means: The energy needed to increase the temperature of 1kg of water by 1°C. This is exactly 1000 small calories or about 4.2&#160;kilojoules.  <em>So if you had a 100 calories snackpack, that&#8217;s scientifically 100,000 calories that you&#8217;re ingesting.  </em>A<em>nd the sentence would read: &#8220;The energy needed to increase the temperature of 100kg of water by 1°C.  This is exactly 100,000 small calories or about 420kilojoules.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Carbohydrates consist of simple and complex sugars and starches.  Simple sugars such as those found in fruits and processed foods are digested more easily and complex sugars are those found in vegetables and whole grain products where the processing hasn&#8217;t stripped away nutrients yet.  Complex sugars take longer to digest but are more packed with nutrition.</p>
<p><strong>Sugars:</strong> These are a subset of carbohydrates and refer mostly to the simple sugars that are mono or disaccharides such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s apply this.</p>
<p><strong>S</strong><strong>ay a product has 66g of &#8220;Sugars&#8221;</strong> and we&#8217;ll be fair, 50% HFCS and 50% Sucrose.  This would mean that it had (33/14.44) <strong>2.29tbsp HFCS</strong> and (33/12.57) <strong>2.63tbsp Sucrose</strong>. And therefore <strong>121.37 calories from HCFS</strong> and <strong>126.24 calories from sugar</strong>.  A 20fl oz bottle of Coke claims to have 240 calories with its 65&#160;g of Sugars.</p>
<p>Suggested sugar intake per day = 33g/day for 2000 calorie diet.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of basic metabolism:  <br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sucrose</strong> is a disaccharide (two sugars in one - fructose and glucose) which stays pretty well put together until the small intestines.  Sucrase, an enzyme, splits sucrose into fructose and glucose.  These then go through their own protein channels from the intestines into the surrounding cells, and from there they make their way into the bloodstream.  They are both then directed towards the liver. </p>
<ul><li>Glucose in the blood and higher glucose levels in the liver stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin.  Insulin stimulates a number of things: 1) The transport of glucose from the blood into tissue cells where it can be used as energy. 2) Stimulates the muscles and liver to store glucose as glycogen which can be used when the body needs a burst of energy (it just reverts back into usable glucose.  3) Any leftover glycogen that isn&#8217;t stored in liver and muscle cells is stored as fat. 4) An appetite suppressant, leptin, is also called to action to let the person know to stop eating!<br /></li>
<li>Fructose, however, does not raise blood sugar so as to stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin (if my reading around is correct).  Doctors have suggested that diabetics switch to fructose consumption due to this lack of blood sugar spiking.  </li>
<li>Once in the liver, fructose gets processed and as a result two separate components DHAP and Glyceraldehyde are formed both of which are precursors to glycogen and triglyceride formation.  Elevated levels of DHAP and Glyceraldehyde drive metabolic pathways toward glucose and subsequent glycogen synthesis. It seems that fructose is a better substrate for glycogen synthesis than glucose and that glycogen replenishment takes precedence over triglyceride formation.  But if there&#8217;s enough glycogen already, then the excess DHAP and Glyceraldehyde will lean towards becoming fatty acids.</li>
</ul><p>Metabolic diagram below:</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh4xlhe7Lc1qf00w4.jpg" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>Random issue: Usually there are no problems with having enough of the enzyme sucrase to chomp away at sucrose.  But if there&#8217;s inflammation or intestinal infection, there may be a temporary loss of cells that produce sucrase.  The undigested sugars then provide a lovely breeding ground for bacteria whose waste products lead to gas/diarrhea, pain.  And sometimes, children who eat way too much sugary stuff end up getting stomachaches as a result of bacterial gas formation.  <em>Heh bacterial farts.</em></p>
<p><strong>High Fructose Corn Syrup</strong> on the other hand is not a disaccharide when it goes into your body.  It&#8217;s processed from the get-go as two separate sugars - fructose and glucose.  There aren&#8217;t really any scientific studies to &#8220;prove&#8221; this or &#8220;disprove&#8221; it because it&#8217;s just a mass of these sugars in different ratios derived from corn.  With too much consumption of fructose, there may not be enough transporters and the fructose ends up going to the large intestines where they become nutrition for bacteria &#8212;&gt; more bacterial farts &#8212;&gt; gas and bloating for you.  Check the fructose metabolism portion of sucrose to see how fructose gets metabolized.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll go into the studies involving higher fructose diets and such in the next tumblr post, but I wanted to present first why fructose would make such a splash.  That it&#8217;s a naturally occurring form of sugar (fruits and such) doesn&#8217;t make this dangerous.  It&#8217;s the sheer amount we now consume.</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh4yq5SPW51qf00w4.jpg" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>Table&#8217;s based on information from the US Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service.  Pretty sharp rise from 1970&#8230;Based on this graphic, we went from taking 80 to 100lbs of sugar a year per person from 1970 to 2006. </p>
<p>So thus far, the answer is that on the molecular level, there&#8217;s not all that much difference between HFCS and Sugar besides the bond between fructose and glucose for sugar as well as the fructose/glucose ratios.  However sodas/pops most likely have higher amounts of HFCS, and our bodies are probably getting way more fructose and sugar than they ought to.</p>

<p>Dynamic vocal microphone with on/off switch, XLR connection, and its  polar pattern is cardioid.  It responds to frequencies between 70-15000  Hz:</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgzi8jPI6d1qf00w4.png" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>Price: 30-50USD</p>
<p>History:  I couldn&#8217;t find too much about these besides that they&#8217;re  the cheaper version of the SM58 which has been the industry standard for  this type of vocal microphone since 1966!  (Sadly they don&#8217;t even have  when the PG48 came out on the Shure timeline of mics made)</p>
<p><strong>SHURE 55SH Series II Unidyne Vocal Microphone</strong></p>

<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgzi9qNevn1qf00w4.gif" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>Price: 175USD</p>
<p>History: The look is iconic!  The first version (SH55) was made in  1939 - <a href="http://shure.custhelp.com/ci/fattach/get/19788/.%C2%A0">http://shure.custhelp.com/ci/fattach/get/19788/. </a> There :).</p>
<p>Shure Green Bullet 520DX Dynamic Harmonica Microphone</p>

<p>Dynamic microphone with crystal diaphragm used primarily by harmonica (harp) players that gives a lovely blues sound to the instrument.  1/4&#8221; jack connection and its polar pattern is omnidirectional - of course its only got one side open to sound so&#8230; Frequency response is between 100-5000Hz.</p>

<p>Price: 120USD</p>
<p>History: According to Shure, if you have a harmonica and you like blues, this is the microphone to use with it!</p>
<p>These again were the dynamic microphones - I&#8217;ll go into the others that we have in Part III!  If you&#8217;d like me to look further into any of these mics, please let me know. </p>

<p>Our starting sentence:</p>
<p>"There are other types of components whose response depends on the polarity and value of voltage and current.  <em>We&#8217;ll explore these with the different components I imagine.</em> These are usually constructed from a semiconductor material.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>SEMICONDUCTOR:</strong> Material that doesn&#8217;t conduct electricity as well as a conductor but is also a pretty poor insulator.  The jack of all trades?</p>
<p>You can DOPE the semiconductor (silicon) with certain impurities (ion implantation) that end up changing how it conducts current.  And depending on <em>how</em> you dope it, you end up with either <strong>N(egative)-type</strong> or <strong>P(ositive)-type</strong> materials. </p>
<ul><li>If it is a <em>pure</em> semiconductor with no doping, it is an <strong>intrinsic semiconductor</strong>.  </li>
<li>If it is lightly doped and stays closer to a semiconductor, it&#8217;s known as an <strong>extrinsic semiconductor</strong>.  </li>
<li>If you dope it such that you end up with a material that&#8217;s more of a  conductor - it&#8217;s called a <strong>degenerate semiconductor</strong>.  </li>
</ul><p>Surprisingly, the wikis for these are pretty well written.  So I&#8217;ll direct you to those, but here&#8217;s a short summary of it a slightly more indepth view on the above terms:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Doping</strong> is making an intrinsic semiconductor into an extrinsic one.  This involves putting atoms of element X on the pure semiconductor so as to encourage either more (extrinsic) or even more (degenerate) conduction of electricity.</li>
<li><strong>N-type semiconductors</strong> are extrinsic.  The doping atoms provide extra conduction electrons to the semiconductor.  This creates an excess of negative (n-type) electron charge carriers.</li>
<li><strong>P-type semiconductors</strong> are made by doping atoms that increase the number of free charge carriers.  Or put in another way, increase the number of positive atoms that can accept electrons and therefore increase the number of holes in the conductor for more electrons to come through.</li>
</ol><p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgn76qy7PE1qf00w4.jpg" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>On the left, silicon is our intrinsic semiconductor.  In the middle is our n-type semiconductor where phosphorus has donated extra electrons to silicon.  On the right is our p-type semiconductor where boron has created more holes.  More electrons = more flow.  More holes = more overall positive charge = more attraction of electrons to those holes = more flow.</p>
<ol></ol><p>So if we think way back to how electrons move through a circuit, I talked about the marble in a tube idea.  N-type conductors is like adding more marbles to increase conductance.  P-type conductors is like taking out more marbles - thus making holes - thus allowing the marbles above to fall down at a more rapid rate.</p>
<p>Now. If you put N- and P-type materials together, the result is a <strong>PN junction </strong>that conducts better in one direction than the other.  More specifics next article!</p>

<p><em>I came home after passing my ACLS/BLS certification to about 60 new tweets flying between @tymkrs, @v2kzay, and @talldarknweirdo with regards to high fructose corn syrup, sugar, and probably the state of man. </em></p>
<p>Anyway I&#8217;m going to attempt to give too long of an answer :) to the following tweet:</p>
<p>"Is there much difference between HFCS and a similar amount of straight sugar?  My understanding is they&#8217;re metabolized the same."</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>According to the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference,</p>
<p><strong>High Fructose Corn Syrup:</strong> There are two main types -</p>
<ol><li>HFCS 55: ~55% fructose and 42% glucose - mostly used in soft drinks</li>
<li>HFCS 42: ~42% fructose and 53% glucose - used in many foods and baked goods</li>
</ol><p>This was first created in 1957 but didn&#8217;t really start to grow until 1977.  A few reasons for this was new governmental production quotas of domestic sugar, subsidies of U.S. corn, and an import tariff on foreign sugar.  These combined to raise the price of sucrose to levels above those of the rest of the world and therefore made HFCS less costly for many sweetener applications.  So companies went to HFCS instead.</p>
<p>How is it made?  The simple answer:</p>
<ol><li>High-fructose corn syrup is produced by milling corn to produce corn starch.</li>
<li>Then processing that starch to yield corn syrup, which is almost entirely glucose</li>
<li>Then adding enzymes that change some of the glucose into fructose. The resulting syrup (after enzyme conversion) contains approximately 42% fructose and is HFCS 42. </li>
<li>The 42% fructose is then purified to 90% fructose, HFCS90. </li>
<li>To make HFCS 55, the HFCS 90 is mixed with HFCS 42 in the appropriate ratios to form the desired HFCS 55.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Table Sugar:</strong> Sucrose which is fructose and glucose linked weakly together.  When broken down during digestion it becomes 50% fructose, 50% glucose.</p>
<p>How is it made? Simply put:</p>
<ol><li>Mills extract raw sugar from freshly harvested cane</li>
<li>This raw sugar is mixed with heavy syrup and then centrifuged in a process called &#8216;affination&#8217; to wash away the sugar crystals&#8217; outer coating, which is less pure than the crystal interior. </li>
<li>The remaining sugar is then dissolved to make a syrup.</li>
<li>The syrup is &#8220;clarified&#8221; by adding a few chemicals which bind to impurities that can be taken away.</li>
<li>The clarified syrup is then decolorized, concentrated and repeatedly crystallized in a vacuum to produce white, refined sugar.</li>
</ol><p>Apparently due to tariffs, subsidies, and quotas, the price of table sugar in the US is nearly twice that of the rest of the world. <em>[looks through tables]</em></p>
<p>Holy Baloney.  I picked a random month/year to compare all of the prices:</p>
<ul><li>World Refined Sugar Prices Jan 2000: 7.70 cents/pound</li>
<li>US Refined Sugar Prices Jan 2000: 43.70 cents/pound</li>
<li>High Fructose Corn Syrup Prices Jan 2000: 15.78 cents/pound</li>
</ul><p>Let&#8217;s look at more recent prices shall we?</p>
<ul><li>World Refined Sugar Prices Jan 2011: 35.58 cents/pound</li>
<li>US Refined Sugar Prices Jan 2011: 65.20 cents/pound</li>
<li>High Fructose Corn Syrup Prices Jan 2011: 32.31 cents/pound</li>
</ul><p>Damn.  The HFCS people must have hella good lobbyists keeping real sugar at that price.</p>

<p>Background:</p>
<p>Capacitors:</p>
<ul><li>Known as voltage smoothers</li>
</ul><p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgetozjlHx1qf00w4.png" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>The power source is constantly allowing the flow of current.  This current goes into all of the pathways possible - whether the light bulb or the capacitor.  So while the power source is driving this flow through the circuit, the capacitor is storing up current as potential energy (voltage in the form of farads - specifically the number of coulombs needed to change the capacitor&#8217;s energy potential by 1 volt).  If the power source drives at a lower voltage (maybe the battery&#8217;s weakening), you can think of it as a decrease in the pressure against the capacitor&#8217;s lid.  With this decrease, the capacitor will release some of its sequestered energy into the circuit.  The light bulb will be none the wiser because it&#8217;s still getting as much energy as it was before.  This is why capacitors are known as voltage smoothers - they make the light bulb think nothing&#8217;s changed with the power source.</p>
<ul><li>Changes in current are ahead of changes in voltage.</li>
</ul><p>A way I&#8217;ve come to understand this is&#8230;it is <em>because</em> of current going into the capacitor that it even develops a voltage (in the form of farads).  And likewise, it&#8217;s because of the current leaving the capacitor that voltage changes in not only the capacitor but also the circuit (as a circuit voltage smoother).  Therefore, you can say that current changes cause voltage changes in capacitors.  A before B.</p>
<p>Inductors:</p>
<ul><li>These are known as current smoothers - ie resist current changes.</li>
</ul><p>Inductors don&#8217;t like the current flow within them to change.  So whenever a circuit is broken, for instance, inductors induce a voltage within itself to force the current to remain flowing at the same amount it did before.</p>
<ul></ul><ul><li>Changes in voltage occur before changes in current.</li>
</ul><p>So unlike the capacitors where they use their current to prevent changes in voltage.  Inductors use a self-generated voltage to prevent changes in current.  And therefore if you look at it in the order that this happens - voltage will change before current changes.</p>
<ul></ul><p>Now. Because these two work opposite of each other (one going from current to voltage, and the other from voltage to current) - circuits that have both capacitors and inductors end up at a point where the two types of reactance are equal and cancel each other out.  These specific frequencies of AC current would therefore induce the condition called <strong>RESONANCE</strong>.  And the frequencies are known as <strong>resonant frequencies</strong>.</p>
<p>Circuits that have both capacitors and inductors will have at least one of these and are called <strong>resonant circuits</strong> or <strong>tuned circuits</strong>.  And in fact, radio users can use this property to their advantage because with variable capacitors or variable inductors, you can tune the circuit to either allow or prevent specific frequencies.</p>
<p>As the manual says: &#8220;A tuned circuit acts as a filter, passing or rejecting signals at its resonant frequency.  Tune circuits are important in radio because they help radios generate or receive signals at a single frequency.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve no exact idea how they actually do the filtering thing&#8230;but perhaps I&#8217;ll check into that.</p>

<p>Background:</p>
<p>Major Types of Microphones - Dynamic, Ribbon, Condenser (amongst others)</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Microphones</strong> use an inductive coil connected to a diaphragm and  placed within the field of a permanent magnet. As the diaphragm moves,  it moves the coil, thus varying the voltage the coil produces. It seems that the majority of dynamic microphones have rugged coils which I think means that the coils won&#8217;t break if you drop it.  IE sturdier construction. And they usually have pretty high SPL (sound pressure level) capability.  *imagines a lumberjack singing&#8230;*</p>
<ul><li>Shure PG48 - Dynamic vocal microphone</li>
<li>Shure 55SH - Dynamic vocal microphone</li>
<li>Shure 520Dx - Has crystal diaphragm instead of coil</li>
</ul><p><strong>Ribbon Microphones</strong> are very delicate.  Instead of a diaphragm, however, they use a thin ribbon that  vibrates to vary voltage.  Ribbon mics are used in the studio for  recording voices and a broad range of instruments.  They soften the sound  and impart a warmth to recorded material.  They also have high SPL  capabilities and so can be placed very close to a sound source.</p>
<ul><li>Nady RSM-4: Short ribbon microphone</li>
<li>Cascade Victor: Long ribbon microphone</li>
</ul><p><strong>Condenser Microphones</strong> have a thin conductive diaphragm located close to a metal  plate called a backplate, creating a capacitor. The capacitor is  supplied with a small electric charge, either from phantom power or from  a battery. When the pressure of soundwaves cause the diaphragm to  vibrate, it changes the distance between it and the backplate, thus  causing variations in the output voltage. This varied output is the  microphone&#8217;s signal. </p>
<ul><li>MAudio Pulsar II Matched Stereo Pair: Small diaphragm condenser mics</li>
</ul><p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgzg52alle1qf00w4.jpg" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>The above illustrates different &#8220;polar patterns&#8221; or directions from which a mic will pick up the most sound. Cardioid means the mic is most sensitive from straight on and from the sides but  rejects sounds from 180 degrees opposite the direction the mic is aimed.  The supercardioid mic accepts a little more sound from a 180-degree  direction but rejects more from each side. The hypercardioid allows yet  more sound from 180 degrees but rejects more of the sound coming from 90  or 270 degrees.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll go into the specific mics next..</p>

<p>Background:</p>
<ul><li>Resistance - Prevents certain amounts of current from passing through the circuit.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Reactance - Resistance from capacitors and inductors to changes in AC current flow.  This leads to capacitors that resist changes in voltage and inductors that resist changes in current.  (Uh for more details please note my confusing posts earlier :p)</li>
</ul><p>Impedance is the TOTAL opposition to current flow in an AC circuit.  Simply put, impedance resists/impedes current flow.  So this term represents the total resistance a circuit has when either resistance, capacitive reactance, inductive reactance, or a combo of them is used.  Opposition to current flow in a DC circuit is simply known as resistance.</p>
<p>Another way of putting it is that impedance is a way of telling you how much of the voltage introduced at one end will make it to the other end.</p>

<p>Background:</p>
<p><strong>Inductor:</strong> These are coils of wire and as current goes  through the wire, an electromagnetic force is created which helps to  keep current going at the same speeds.  When the circuit is broken, in  an effort to keep the current going at the same rate, inductors will use  the electromagnetic forces to pseudo create extra voltage to keep  electrons going.  This keeps up&#8230;until it can&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Inductive Reactance Part 1</strong></p>
<p>From google searches, Inductive Reactance:</p>
<ol><li>Is the opposition of an inductor to changes in current caused by  build-up of magnetic fields.  These fields produce  counter-electromagnetic forces that oppose changes in the initial  current.</li>
<li> If current is increasing in magnitude, the induced voltage  will  “push against” the electron flow. <em>This makes sense - the more current, the more electric potential build up, and therefore the more induced voltage.  It&#8217;s like a spring.  The more you push on it, the harder it gets to push.  So to, the voltage will provide more resistance against subsequent electron flow.</em><strong><br /></strong></li>
<li>If current is decreasing, the   polarity will reverse and “push with” the electron flow to oppose the   decrease. <em>This makes sense if we know something about how inductors work - despite what was said in number 2, inductors want currents to stay at the same speed through them at all times, and if it starts to slow down, it&#8217;ll develop a voltage via electromagnetic forces to keep current up and so will &#8220;push with&#8221; the electron flow.</em></li>
<li>Inductors oppose <em>changes</em> in current through them, by dropping a voltage directly proportional to the <em>rate of change</em> of current.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Inductive Reactance Part 2</strong></p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lg8khca3Hf1qf00w4.png" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p><em>The  way I think about this is if you have a bar magnet as your inductor  with its N pole going up and it&#8217;s S pole going down.  And your current  is represented by another another bar magnet that has its pole S up N  down - to best attract to the inductor.  THEN AC current comes along and  flips your current so that both magnets have N pole up and S pole  down.  You&#8217;d end up with a bit of magnetic resistance until either the  inductor magnet flipped or the current flipped its polarity again (see  picture)</em></p>
<p>Per Wiki:</p>
<p>The back-emf is the source of the opposition to current flow.  A constant DC current has a zero rate-of-change, and sees an inductor as a short-circuit (it is typically made from a material with a low resistivity).  An alternating current  has a time-averaged rate-of-change that is proportional to frequency,  this causes the increase in inductive reactance with increased frequency.</p>
<p><strong>Inductive Reactance Part 3</strong></p>
<p>So you&#8217;ll remember that Capacitors are known as voltage smoothers.  Likewise, inductors are known as current smoothers (in a manner of speaking.  This is largely because their main action is preventing changes in current.  Let&#8217;s look at the phase difference in an inductor to see how this works:</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfzc0wTWNZ1qf00w4.gif" alt="image" /></p></p>
<ol><li>Voltage dropped across an inductor is a reaction against the <em>change</em> in current through it.  <em>Ie inductors don&#8217;t want their current to change.</em></li>
<li>Voltage = zero  whenever current is at a peak (when current doesn&#8217;t increase or decrease).  <em>When current&#8217;s not changing, no voltage is induced to try to change that situation.</em></li>
<li>Voltage is at a  peak wherever the instantaneous current is at maximum change (the points  of steepest slope on the current wave, where it crosses the zero line - when current is traveling the fastest).  <em>When current is changing the most, the inductor is trying to get an induced voltage to work against that change.  </em></li>
<li>The voltage wave seems to  have a “head start” on the current wave; the voltage “leads” the  current, and the current “lags” behind the voltage.</li>
</ol><p>Again, I haven&#8217;t really reached my eureka moment, but I&#8217;ve been thinking about reactance for the past week and it hasn&#8217;t gotten better.  So if you&#8217;d like to help me out, feel free to leave a comment!!</p>

<p>[Cue a written and queued post.  Re-drafted. Deleted. Then three days of googling, then hemming and hawing about how to explain it in a way that anyone would understand it.]</p>
<p>So from all of my Google searches, there were a number of repeated definitions for reactance.</p>
<p><strong>Reactance</strong> is [unwanted] resistance in a circuit element (capacitor or inductor) to changes in current speed and/or direction.  Appropriately enough, <strong>capacitive reactance</strong> is created by capacitors, while <strong>inductive reactance</strong> is created by inductors.  It is most often associated with AC current though when a DC current is first starting or stopping from a newly closed/broken circuit, a certain amount of reactance may be experienced.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p><strong>Capacitor:</strong>  DC Current cannot pass through capacitors because capacitors are essentially parasitic breaks in the circuit.  Current ends up filling up the capacitor like a gas tank, and that&#8217;s it.  No more current can go through.  It can only come back out as released current.  AC current on the other hand, pushes and pulls.  It brings in current, then takes it back out with the tide.  That in and of itself creates a current.  In a circuit, you can tap between the power supply and the capacitor and there&#8217;ll still be current passing through. </p>
<p>Another way to think about it is that when a current is being forced into a capacitor, electric potential builds up inside of the capacitor - so to a certain extent, there is voltage inside that capacitor.  And when a capacitor is connected to a circuit, it always wants to &#8220;reequilibrate&#8221; or leak the power it&#8217;s been given back into the circuit and that allows them to be voltage smoothers (see capacitor lesson).</p>
<p>So from google, the search results consistently state the following.</p>
<p><strong>Capacitive Reactance Part 1</strong></p>
<ol><li>Deals with the changing electrical fields between two conductive surfaces.  </li>
</ol><ul><li>Initial thoughts: Duh. Capacitive reactance deals with capacitors which <em>is</em> &#8220;changing electrical fields between two conductive surfaces&#8221;. So what?</li>
<li>Is there internal resistance to the constant changing of where the electrons reside in the plate-dielectric-plate system of the capacitor?</li>
</ul><p>    2. Is resistance to changes in the initial voltage.</p>
<ul><li>Initial thoughts: Is there a constant voltage in the capacitor itself that current would have to fight against when moving back and forth?</li>
</ul><p><strong>Capacitive Reactance Part 2</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been mentioned that an actual EXAMPLE of capacitors having reactance was the fact that they slowly leak out their electrical energy in a circuit as opposed to just releasing everything all at once.</p>
<ul><li>"In a circuit where the applied voltage signal is continually changing  from a positive cycle to a negative cycle at a rate that is determined by the frequency (a sine wave voltage), the  capacitor is either being charged or discharged on a continuous basis. <strong>As the capacitor charges or discharges a current  flows through it which itself is restricted by the internal resistance of the capacitor.</strong>" <a href="http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/filter_1.html">http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/filter_1.html</a></li>
<li><strong>A capacitor has a definitive time period for charging</strong> (T = RxC) The time T in seconds is equal to the resistance times the capacitance.  And it also takes the same amount of time to discharge.  And when AC is present across the terminals of a capacitor, it changes faster than the capacitor can charge and discharge.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Capacitive Reactance Part 3</strong></p>
<p>Strangely enough.  The faster the current goes back and forth from plate to plate (higher frequency), the less reactance (resistance) there seems to be.  Vice-versa, the slower the current goes back and forth from plate to plate (lower frequency), the more reactance (resistance) there seems to be.  <em>You&#8217;d think that the more back and forth there was, the more resistance that would be encountered.</em> </p>
<p>As the  frequency increases, the capacitor passes more charge across the plates in a given time resulting in a greater overall current flow  through the capacitor appearing as if the internal resistance of the capacitor has decreased.  Mind tricks! </p>
<p>Wiki has a nice explanation for this:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance</a></p>
<p>A DC voltage applied across a capacitor causes charge to accumulate on one side; the electric field due to the accumulated charge is the source of the opposition to the current. When the potential associated with the charge exactly balances the applied voltage, the current goes to zero.<em> So if you have 4.5 volts pushing a current into a capacitor, when the voltage in the capacitor = 4.5V, current stops.<br /></em></p>
<p>Driven by an AC supply, a capacitor will only accumulate a limited  amount of charge before the potential difference changes sign and the  charge dissipates. The higher the frequency, the less charge will  accumulate and the smaller the opposition to the current. </p>
<p><strong>Capacitive Reactance Part 4</strong></p>
<p>There is often talk of LAG and LEAD when explaining reactance.  This mainly having to do with the phase differences between current and voltage in a given resistive element:</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfzc0k51PI1qf00w4.gif" alt="image" /></p></p>
<ol><li>Current = zero  whenever voltage is at a peak (Voltage is not changing but is at its highest/lowest measurable mark).  </li>
<li>Current is at a  peak wherever voltage is at maximum change (the points  of steepest slope on the voltage wave, where it crosses the zero line).  <em>And if you think about it - the faster that current is flowing into a capacitor, the more voltage that&#8217;s being sequestered in that capacitor.  Without current flow you don&#8217;t have an electric potential build up.</em></li>
<li>The current wave seems to  have a “head start” on the voltage wave: the current “leads” the  voltage, and the voltage “lags” behind the current.  </li>
<li>As a result: They say that current through a capacitor is a reaction against the <em>change</em> in voltage across it.  Ie when there&#8217;s a change in the voltage, the more change (whether the capacitor is getting more voltage or releasing voltage), the more current that passes through the capacitor.</li>
</ol><p>No idea!  I haven&#8217;t hit my eureka moment for capacitive reactance, but if you&#8217;d like to help explain it to me, I am /more than willing/ to hear you out!</p>

<p>"In capacitors and inductors, the relationship between ac voltage and current is altered so that there&#8217;s an offset in time between changes in one and changes in the other as energy is stored, then released.  That means voltage and current have a <em>phase difference</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I think this one came relatively easy to me simply because of how capacitors and inductors work.  We know they store energy.  I actually went through how they stored energy from a couple of posts ago.  And I mentioned that there is a delay in taking power away from an inductor and the <em>effects</em> of that power actually disappearing - as the magnetic field tries to keep current flow as fast as before.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s the same thing here.  There&#8217;s a delay between when you shut off the power and when you actually see the effect of that.  And a phase difference would just look like the following:</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfzc0k51PI1qf00w4.gif" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>This is the phase difference of a capacitor.  In a capacitor, as voltage increases, the capacitor charges up (filling up a gas tank). Thus a large initial current/influx of electrons.  As the voltage peaks, the  capacitor gets full up and the current falls to zero since no more electrons can flow in that direction.  This circuit reverses and the charge leaves the capacitor.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Point A:</strong> The voltage is zero and the  capacitor is uncharged. Initially, the voltage increases quickly. The  voltage across the capacitor matches the power supply voltage, so the  current is large enough to build up charge on the capacitor plates. The closer  the voltage gets to its peak, the slower it changes, meaning less  current has to flow. </li>
<li>When the voltage reaches a peak at <strong>Point B</strong>, the  capacitor is fully charged and the current is momentarily zero.  After this peak, the voltage starts dropping - <em>I suppose this is because the need for the voltage has disappeared.</em>  </li>
<li>For the capacitor to discharge/release its stored energy, the current has to reverse its direction. When  the voltage passes through zero at <strong>Point C</strong>, it&#8217;s changing quite rapidly;  to match this voltage the current must be large and negative.  <em>I wonder if this has anything to do with the polarity of ac current going from positive to negative polarity?</em></li>
<li>Step 3 - Between <strong>Points C and D</strong>, the voltage is negative. Charge  builds up again on the capacitor plates, but the polarity is opposite to  what it was in step one.  With the negative voltage, the current is also negative, and as the  voltage reaches its negative peak at <strong>Point D</strong> the current drops to zero.</li>
<li>Step 4 - After <strong>Point D</strong>, the voltage heads toward zero and the  capacitor must discharge.  When the voltage reaches zero it&#8217;s gone  through a full cycle so it&#8217;s back to <strong>Point A</strong> again to repeat the cycle.  Again, like a pendulum.</li>
</ul><p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfzc0wTWNZ1qf00w4.gif" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>This is the phase difference of an inductor.  In inductors, however the voltage changes, the current tries to oppose that  change.  <em>Remember it&#8217;s like the car trying to rev up to get to highway speeds.  Imagine having to do that then slow down to 30mph, then rev up again.  You end up with dealing with the resistance of the car. </em> When the voltage is not changing there is no current and no  magnetic field.</p>
<ul><li>As the voltage from the power source increases from zero, the voltage  on the inductor matches it. <em>With the capacitor, the voltage came from  the charge stored on the capacitor plates (or, equivalently, from the  electric field between the plates). </em>With the inductor, the voltage comes  from changing the flux/current through the coil, which changes the magnetic field in the coil.</li>
<li>To produce a large positive voltage, a large increase in current  is required. When the voltage passes through zero, the current should  stop changing just for an instant. When the voltage is large and  negative, the current should be decreasing quickly.</li>

<p>[Insert excited.gif here]</p>
<p><strong>Resistors:</strong> Gatekeepers for current.  They prevent specific amounts of current from getting through.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Variable resistor:</strong> Allows you to control how much resistance a circuit has to deal with in a given spot.  The way it works is there are three terminals.  Let&#8217;s label them 1, 2, and 3.  </li>
</ul><p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfx3esOLxO1qf00w4.jpg" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>Because Terminal 2 is connected to the output, it can receive signals ranging from Ground (no signal) to Input (maximal signal).</p>
<ol><li>Terminal 1 - Usually connected to ground</li>
<li>Terminal 2 - Wiper - Connected to output</li>
<li>Terminal 3 - Connected to input</li>
</ol><ul><li>The terminal in the middle is the WIPER, and the other two are known as ENDs.  The wiper travels along a circular resistive strip when the knob is turned.  Resistance is measured with respect to the wiper and either one of the end terminals. </li>
<li>The closer  the wiper is to the end terminal it is wired in conjunction with (let&#8217;s assume terminal 3), the  less the resistance, because the path of the current will be shorter.  The further away it moves from the terminal, the greater the resistance  will be.  </li>
<li>Said in another way.  If there is ZERO resistance at End Terminal 3, when you make the wiper go counter-clockwise, the current has to travel farther along the resistive element in the squiggly lines to leave the circuit, which takes a longer amount of time, and requires the current to get past more resistance.  So when you finally reach Terminal 1 (associated w/ground) - you end up with hardly any signal.</li>
</ul><p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfx2yhQ2pa1qf00w4.jpg" alt="image" /></p></p>
<ul><li>Example: Volume Control, Light Dimmer</li>
</ul><p><strong>Capacitors:</strong> Store certain amounts of current that can be released over time or just sequestered (until abruptly released).  Remember they consist of electrodes with dielectric material between them.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Variable capacitor: </strong>These allow for changing the amount of capacitance a capacitor stores.  The rotor-stator type of variable capacitor shown below shows how you can rotate a set of plates to overlap less or more with another set of plates.  The more overlap there is, the more capacitance there is, and therefore the greater the ability to store electricity. </li>
<li>Example: Radio Tuner</li>
</ul><p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfx4p7LtDu1qf00w4.gif" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p><strong> Inductors:</strong> Stores magnetic energy caused by a current going through a wire.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Variable Inductors:</strong> These can be made by changing the number of coils that an inductor has, or even how far a magnetic bar reaches inside the coils.   Moving the core farther inside = higher inductance.  And decreasing the number of coils an inductor has = lower inductance.</li>
<li>Example: Radio Tuning as well</li>
</ul><p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfx58coibI1qf00w4.jpg" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p><strong>Transformers:</strong> Made from two/more inductors that share their stored energy.  This allows energy to be transferred from one inductor to another. </p>
<ul><li>Example: transferring energy from a 120V AC outlet to a lower voltage for electronic equipment.</li>

<p><strong>Inductors Part 1</strong></p>
<p><em>This statement makes a few assumptions about what we know:</em></p>
<p><em>1) That we knew that magnetic fields could be created by current going through a wire.</em></p>
<p><em>2) That we knew that magnetic energy could be stored.</em></p>
<p><em>3) That inductance sounds like something I would understand.</em></p>
<p>It seems that this would require us to look at ELECTROMAGNETS.  Essentially, when <em>any</em> charged particle moves, it creates a magnetic &#8220;tunnel/field&#8221; around its path  of travel, and that magnetic field moves with the  particle, constantly surrounding it.  The area of influence depends on the strength of the  magnetic field, which is directly related to the cross-sectional area of  the conductor (wire vs bar), the rate of flow of the current and the change in  direction of its flow (AC vs DC). </p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfwxj6ICTw1qf00w4.gif" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>The green is the cross section of a given wire, and the rings around it represent the magnetic field as current passes through it.  The closer the rings are, the stronger the magnetism.</p>
<p>The main way they found out about this, I imagine, is by experimentation.</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfwxku3Ete1qf00w4.gif" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>So if you hook a battery up to a wire that is coiled around a nail, you&#8217;d figure out that you&#8217;d be able to pick up paper clips and other items that had magnetic properties.  And indeed, the strong the magnetic properties of whatever you wrap the coil around, the stronger the magnet.</p>
<p>And from just that example, coils were found to be more efficient magnets than just plain wires with current running through them.  The coils and each of their respective electromagnetic fields ADD up as they get closer to each other.  So from just a few coils, what was a super weak magnetic field as a straight wire, now is something that can do something.</p>
<p><strong>Inductors Part 2</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s essentially what an <strong>inductor</strong> is - a coiled piece of wire.  When current runs through it, it develops a magnetic field.  Now the question becomes, how is this magnetic energy stored? </p>
<p>So, the way I understood this was that when the current first starts going through the wire of the inductor, there&#8217;s a certain amount of resistance - kind of like when you&#8217;re on a ramp merging onto the highway, and how you have to speed up to get to that 60-70mph.  There&#8217;s that bit of time that you haven&#8217;t gotten the magnetic field set up yet.  But then once you&#8217;re at 60 mph, it&#8217;s easier to stay that way.  Current is like that in an inductor.  There&#8217;s a little bit of resistance which may require more power, but once the current and magnetic field is established, the current will prefer staying at that speed.</p>
<ul><li>The analogy of inductance in the physical world is the inertia of the   mass of an object.  It requires a force to get it moving, but once it&#8217;s   moving it tends to keep moving.  That&#8217;s similar to the way current acts   in an inductor.  The higher the inductance (mass) the slower the  current  increases (velocity) for a given voltage (force).  <a href="http://www.electro-tech-online.com/general-electronics-chat/43023-choke-coils.html">http://www.electro-tech-online.com/general-electronics-chat/43023-choke-coils.html</a></li>
</ul><p>Say the power source is turned off or the circuit is broken.  The magnetic field in the wire doesn&#8217;t just like to stop the current it&#8217;s helping through.  It wants to maintain that same current speed that it had been enjoying before - so it squeezes the last bit of juice (increasing what voltage it has) that it can before giving up.  In other words, in the way that the capacitor current spikes when you short it, the inductor voltage spikes when you open the circuit. </p>
<p><em>Note: As a capacitor stores and releases energy in a circuit, it smooths out voltage changes.  But as inductors store and release energy, they smooth out current changes.</em></p>
<p>An inductor&#8217;s ability to store magnetic energy is measured by its inductance in units of henries (H).  Therefore, inductance is essentially the property of a circuit storing energy in the form of an electromagnetic field.  It&#8217;s also the property of opposing changes in current (as explained above). </p>
<ul><li>An important thing to note is that inductors will easily allow direct current to go through, but not alternating current.  Remember, inductors oppose changes in current, and that&#8217;s all that AC is, a back and forth change in current direction.  So sometimes inductors are called &#8220;chokes&#8221; and are used to block ac signals.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Inductors Part 3: Quasi Summary</strong></p>
<ul><li>Inductors react against changes in current by dropping voltage in the polarity necessary to oppose the change. </li>
<li>When an inductor is faced with an increasing current, it acts as a load: dropping voltage as it absorbs energy (negative on the current entry side and positive on the current exit side, like a resistor).</li>
<li>When an inductor is faced with a decreasing current, it acts as a power source: creating voltage as it releases stored energy (positive on the current entry side and negative on the current exit side, like a battery).</li>
</ul><p>To actually measure this&#8230;.</p>

<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfvbp313Ag1qf00w4.jpg" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>Here is a picture of what I&#8217;d think would be a typical capacitor  that people see on their circuit boards/bread boards, whatever. To read  the capacitor&#8217;s side:</p>
<p>This means the capacitor has 2200 micro-farads of storage capacity,  with an upper voltage rating of 16 volts alternating current.</p>
<p>1) <strong>Nominal Capacitance:</strong> 2200 microfarads - The value  of the capacitance, C of a  capacitor, is measured in pico-Farads (pF),  nano-Farads (nF) or micro-Farads (µF) and is marked onto the body of  the capacitor as numbers, letters or coloured bands.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Working Voltage:</strong> 16v - The working voltage is the  maximum continuous voltage (either DC or AC) that can be  applied to  the capacitor without failure during its working life.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Polarization:</strong> The majority of  capacitors have  their negative terminal clearly marked with either a black stripe, band,  arrows or chevrons down one side of their body as shown, to prevent any  incorrect connection to the DC  supply.</p>
<ul><li>With both leads of the capacitor coming out of the same end,  that black band is on the side of the negative lead.  And if you have a  capacitor where the leads come out on opposite ends, the arrow will  point to let you know which way the negative lead is.</li>
</ul><p>4) <strong>Tolerance (±%):</strong> Sometimes, capacitors also have a tolerance rating and reflects the range of potential capacitance that that particular capacitor can hold.  So a 100µF capacitor with a ±20% tolerance could legitimately vary from 80µF to 120µF and still remain within tolerance.  The most common tolerance variation for capacitors is 5% or 10% but some plastic capacitors are rated as low as ±1%.</p>
<p>5) <strong>Working Temperature (T):</strong> Changes in temperature can affect the capacitance because of any changes in the dielectric medium.  The normal working range for most  capacitors is -30°C to +125°C with nominal voltage ratings.  These are often written on the actual capacitor as well.</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfvecaihoI1qf00w4.jpg" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>These are examples that include all of the specifications I detailed earlier.  And for more details on other characteristics that capacitors have:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/capacitor/cap_3.html">http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/capacitor/cap_3.html</a></p>
<p>Sometimes, if the capacitor is too small, it&#8217;ll use a &#8220;code&#8221; much like how resistors use color bands to be deciphered.  Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfvei3mUS21qf00w4.jpg" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take the 203M capacitor and see what its capacitance is.</p>
<p>So like in resistors: the 2 = 1<sup>st</sup> digit, the 0 = 2<sup>nd</sup> digit, the 3 is the multiplier in  pico-Farads, pF and the letter M is the tolerance  	and this translates to:	<br /><br />   20pF * 1,000 (3 zero&#8217;s) = 20,000&#160;pF , 20nF or 0.020 uF</p>
<p>The M indicates a tolerance of +/- 20%</p>
<p>The following link is a good place to look further into deciphering how much capacitance a capacitor has depending on color bands and letters/numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Capacitor Part 1:</strong></p>
<p>@whixr mentioned to me that capacitors are often used to allow AC current but not DC current, and so are known as DC blockers.  So another metaphor that he&#8217;s come up with is the following.  Capacitance is like a rubber membrane in a barrel (brown line).  Pipes are attached to each end of the barrel and a pump connects those pipes.  You can only pump water in one direction so much, then the rubber wall will not stretch anymore (stretching possible according to dotted black lines).  Picture:</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lg778a87gE1qf00w4.png" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>With DC current, that&#8217;s like pumping water from only the left to the right side (for instance).  The water can only go against the rubber membrane so much, before it stops.  If however, you have AC current, it&#8217;s like the pump pumping water from the left, then the pump pumping water from the right.  And the water ends up going back and forth.  So that anything in between the pump (power source) and barrel (capacitor) can take advantage of that current.  So too capacitors do not allow DC current through and only allow AC current to work upon it.</p>
<p><strong>Capacitor Part 2:</strong></p>
<p>This is of my own making from studying capacitors and from what Whisker&#8217;s told me about capacitors.  Essentially a capacitor&#8217;s like a cul-de-sac, and kids running into the cul-de-sac is like electrons going into one side of the barrel or electrode.  They can&#8217;t go past the cul-de-sac (re: DC current).  The only way is to go back the way they came in (re: AC current).</p>
<p><strong>Capacitor Part 3:</strong></p>
<p>So we have a sandwich: two conducting surfaces called <strong>electrodes</strong> and between these two electrodes, an insulating <strong>dielectric</strong> (wood/rubber/air).  <em>Remember, conductors allow current to flow easily and insulators do not.</em></p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfv7p39F8a1qf00w4.png" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>This is when no power is running through yet - when both electrodes have the same number of electrons as the other, and therefore no voltage/electric potential has been induced.  (Our dielectric is Gandalf)</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfv7vyUNIP1qf00w4.png" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve gone and gotten the battery on and as always, the current will go towards the positive electrode.  Current will go in the only direction it can towards the negative electrode of this capacitor.</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfv800CUu31qf00w4.png" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>Well now that you&#8217;ve gotten all of the electrons on one side of the equation, there&#8217;s this electric field that&#8217;s been created, and it&#8217;s got a huge amount of energy potential behind it.  I&#8217;ve gone ahead and taken the battery away.</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfv89n0Sjd1qf00w4.png" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>And when you end up putting both ends of the capacitor on the same conductor, you get a huge rush of electrons rushing back to balance things out = pow! bam! crackle!</p>
<p><strong>Capacitor Part 4:</strong></p>
<p>When a capacitor is connected to a circuit, as current flows into it, it develops an electrical potential (seen above) - this is known as voltage though measured in farads (amount of current to increase the voltage in the capacitor by 1volt/second).  Remember that the capacitor always wants to  &#8220;reequilibrate&#8221; or &#8220;leak&#8221; the current it&#8217;s been given <strong>back into</strong> the  circuit.  That&#8217;s why capacitors are known as voltage smoothers.  Example:</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lg7ajm2J0a1qf00w4.png" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>Alright.  So we&#8217;ve got a power source that&#8217;s not very reliable - sometimes it gives out a certain amount of power, and when the weather&#8217;s bad, it gives out another amount of power.  All within a certain range, but not precise all of the time.  Everything&#8217;s connected to ground.  And we&#8217;re trying to light a light bulb.  So when the power source is pushing forth too much power, it gets sucked up by the capacitor and the capacitor&#8217;s &#8220;rubber membrane&#8221; absorbs that extra energy.  However, should the voltage falter from the power source, the capacitor then takes up the slack and releases its energy into the circuit.  This allows &#8220;voltage smoothing&#8221; to occur, and the light bulb would never know the difference!</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfvbrzJYFR1qf00w4.gif" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>These are the more common types of capacitors as well as different specs for each. (<a href="http://i.cmpnet.com/planetanalog/2007/06/C0201-Table2.gif">http://i.cmpnet.com/planetanalog/2007/06/C0201-Table2.gif</a>) </p>

<p><strong>Current</strong> is measured in <em>amperes</em> which is coulombs/second</p>
<p><strong>Voltage</strong> is measured in <em>volts</em></p>
<p><strong>Resistance</strong> is measured in <em>ohms</em></p>
<p>NOW in looking at <strong>circuit components</strong> - they <em>each</em> have their own units of measurement and affect voltage/current in their own way.  Firstly:</p>
<p><strong>Resistors</strong> have specific resistance which is measured in <em>ohms</em> - These control how much current gets past them, like gatekeepers.  Any  excess energy that they don&#8217;t let by can be released in the form of  heat - so resistors not only block, they release energy.  They are also  known as voltage dividers.  Whenever they&#8217;re placed in series, much like  light bulbs (resistors in and of themselves), they take a certain  amount of voltage based on their resistance levels.  So if you have a  series circuit full of resistors, you&#8217;ll see that the voltage is divided  among all of them.</p>
<p>The following is a note from one of our youtube viewers to help add on with this concept:</p>
<ul><li>The higher the resistance, the higher the force needed to push  that current (electrons) through it. Some call it a voltage drop or  loss﻿ because now it&#8217;s not available for the rest of the circuit. That  force is called electromotive force (emf). With these &#8220;voltage divider&#8221;  experiments, the current is always the same through each resistor in  series, and that concept is what the &#8220;voltage divider formula&#8221; is  derived from, so when I can&#8217;t remember it,﻿ I just derive it using two  resistor values.</li>
<li>One thing that people might not know immediately, is that if the  voltage source changes, current then changes, and then the voltages  across the (same valued) resistors changes.﻿ ﻿ A lot of changes, and yet  the ratio of voltage losses (or power losses/power used up) is still  the same (a constant) for the system of resistors.  <strong>Thanks Trailkeeper!</strong></li>
</ul><p>Example!</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfv8vx5yO91qf00w4.jpg" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>Tungsten filaments actually have HIGH resistance!  Because of that,  when current flows through, the excess energy that can&#8217;t &#8220;easily&#8221; get  through becomes heat and light energy. </p>
<p>And the more well known resistors have those little color bands around them to let you read how much resistance they provide:</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfv9fpoeyG1qf00w4.gif" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>So there are a few types of bands:</p>
<p>1) Digit bands - In 4 Band resistors - the first 2 color bands are  digit bands and give you the numerical amount of resistance.  From the  example above, 27 is what you get when you start piecing how much  resistance this resistor has.</p>
<p>2) Multiplier band - This lets you know how many &#8220;zeros&#8221; come after  your digit bands.  So in the 4 band resistor example above, the peach  band gives you x1000.  So that&#8217;s 27,000Ohms - or 27 kOhms.</p>
<p>3) Tolerance band - This shows how precise the resistance is.  IE,  how close to 27 kOhms of resistance does this resistor actually have.   Plus or minus x percentage.  Some also say that this should be read as&#8221;%  failure rate per 1000hrs&#8221;.</p>
<p>4) Temperature Coefficient - Some resistors have this, but most do not. </p>
<ul><li>This is important because this number indicates how temperature  changes affect the resistor&#8217;s ability to resist - positive or negative.  </li>
<li>If they have a negative temperature coefficient, an increase in temperature means a decrease in resistance.  </li>
<li>If they have a positive temperature coefficient, an increase in temperature is an increase in resistance.</li>
<li>And a low temperature coefficient means that the change in resistance per degree of temperature change is slight.</li>

<p>This may seem insignificant to those who don&#8217;t know why this would be such a big deal.  But let&#8217;s explain the basics of why an open source hardware/software license would be important. </p>
<p>You&#8217;ve designed a circuit and program, put it up on your blog without any license - heck, you&#8217;ve even wanted others to tell you how you can make the software you&#8217;ve programmed better.  So the code/circuit you&#8217;ve made is open for anyone to see (legibility unnecessary):</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lggb471Mpj1qf00w4.jpg" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>Little do you realize you&#8217;re a brilliant genius and that there&#8217;s a niche in the market that Company X sees your invention filling.  So Company X takes your poor defenseless creation, packages it into a 5cent box, and patents it to sell.</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lggba1Qund1qf00w4.jpg" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the planet, your friends decide to whack you upside the head and say, look, we&#8217;ll give you 5 bucks, go get it made, then show it off or sell it at CES or Maker Faire.  Whatever, do something with it!</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lggb4rvjPc1qf00w4.jpg" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>Somehow, Company X gets wind that you&#8217;ve made something and want to sell it.  They sue you and claim that because they have a patent for the circuit and program, you owe them 1 million dollars.  Lose.</p>
<p>Back to the point.  Let&#8217;s talk about what we already have - Open Source Software Licenses.  These are copyright licenses for software that make the registered source code available for everyone to use.  You can review and change the code for your own needs and it can be used in anyone else&#8217;s projects, redistributed, etc.  These allow many different people the ability to use open source software as springboards for bigger and better creations.  If the software&#8217;s licensed and registered as open source, that software is in public records as &#8220;prior art&#8221;.  Then no one has to worry that some company will come along, steal the information, patent it, and sue those who have used it. </p>
<p>It is only now that an Open Source Hardware Definition has withstood the tests of time, lawyers, and the open source community so that it can achieve status 1.0.  I assume this is a big step because once this is approved, the community can start creating licenses that adhere to the definition and then release their hardware with the OSHW logo.  This would then protect the hardware they&#8217;ve created from companies that would take it, keep it closed, and ensure its stagnancy.</p>
<p>There are, however, still a few things to iron out:</p>
<ol><li>Endorsement of the definition and refining of the definition</li>
<li>Choosing an icon&#8230;   &#8230;</li>
<li>More endorsement and support</li>
</ol><blockquote></blockquote>
<p>And the following is the definition:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Open Source Hardware (OSHW) Statement of Principles 1.0</strong><br /> Open source hardware is hardware whose design is made publicly available  so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make and sell the design  or hardware based on that design. The hardware’s source, the design from  which it is made, is available in the preferred format for making  modifications to it. Ideally, open source hardware uses  readily-available components and materials, standard processes, open  infrastructure, unrestricted content, and open-source design tools to  maximize the ability of individuals to make and use hardware. Open  source hardware gives people the freedom to control their technology  while sharing knowledge and encouraging commerce through the open  exchange of designs.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source Hardware (OSHW) Definition 1.0</strong><br /> OSHW Draft Definition 1.0 is based on the Open Source Definition for  Open Source Software and draft OSHW definition 0.5. The definition is  derived from the Open Source Definition, which was created by Bruce  Perens and the Debian developers as the Debian Free Software Guidelines.  Videos and Documentation of the Opening Hardware workshop which kicked  off the below definition are available here. Please join the  conversation about the definition here</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Open Source Hardware (OSHW) is a term for tangible artifacts — machines,  devices, or other physical things — whose design has been released to  the public in such a way that anyone can make, modify, distribute, and  use those things. This definition is intended to help provide guidelines  for the development and evaluation of licenses for Open Source  Hardware.<br /> It is important to note that hardware is different from software in that  physical resources must always be committed for the creation of  physical goods. Accordingly, persons or companies producing items  (“products”) under an OSHW license have an obligation not to imply that  such products are manufactured, sold, warrantied, or otherwise  sanctioned by the original designer and also not to make use of any  trademarks owned by the original designer.</p>
<p>The distribution terms of Open Source Hardware must comply with the following criteria:</p>
<p><strong>1. Documentation</strong><br /> The hardware must be released with documentation including design files,  and must allow modification and distribution of the design files. Where  documentation is not furnished with the physical product, there must be  a well-publicized means of obtaining this documentation for no more  than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the  Internet without charge. The documentation must include design files in  the preferred format for making changes, for example the native file  format of a CAD program. Deliberately obfuscated design files are not  allowed. Intermediate forms analogous to compiled computer code — such  as printer-ready copper artwork from a CAD program — are not allowed as  substitutes. The license may require that the design files are provided  in fully-documented, open format(s).</p>
<p><strong>2. Scope</strong><br /> The documentation for the hardware must clearly specify what portion of  the design, if not all, is being released under the license.</p>
<p><strong>3. Necessary Software</strong><br /> If the licensed design requires software, embedded or otherwise, to  operate properly and fulfill its essential functions, then the license  may require that one of the following conditions are met:<br /> a) The interfaces are sufficiently documented such that it could  reasonably be considered straightforward to write open source software  that allows the device to operate properly and fulfill its essential  functions. For example, this may include the use of detailed signal  timing diagrams or pseudocode to clearly illustrate the interface in  operation.<br /> b) The necessary software is released under an OSI-approved open source license.</p>
<p><strong>4. Derived Works</strong><br /> The license shall allow modifications and derived works, and shall allow  them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the  original work. The license shall allow for the manufacture, sale,  distribution, and use of products created from the design files, the  design files themselves, and derivatives therof.</p>
<p><strong>5. Free redistribution</strong><br /> The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the  project documentation. The license shall not require a royalty or other  fee for such sale. The license shall not require any royalty or fee  related to the sale of derived works.</p>
<p><strong>6. Attribution</strong><br /> The license may require derived documents, and copyright notices  associated with devices, to provide attribution to the licensors when  distributing design files, manufactured products, and/or derivatives  thereof. The license may require that this information be accessible to  the end-user using the device normally, but shall not specify a specific  format of display. The license may require derived works to carry a  different name or version number from the original design.</p>
<p><strong>7. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups</strong><br /> The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.</p>
<p><strong>8. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor</strong><br /> The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the work  (including manufactured hardware) in a specific field of endeavor. For  example, it must not restrict the hardware from being used in a  business, or from being used in nuclear research.</p>
<p><strong>9. Distribution of License</strong><br /> The rights granted by the license must apply to all to whom the work is  redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by  those parties.</p>
<p><strong>10. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product</strong><br /> The rights granted by the license must not depend on the licensed work  being part of a particular product. If a portion is extracted from a  work and used or distributed within the terms of the license, all  parties to whom that work is redistributed should have the same rights  as those that are granted for the original work.</p>
<p><strong>11. License Must Not Restrict Other Hardware or Software</strong><br /> The license must not place restrictions on other items that are  aggregated with the licensed work but not derivative of it. For example,  the license must not insist that all other hardware sold with the  licensed item be open source, nor that only open source software be used  external to the device.</p>
<p><strong>12. License Must Be Technology-Neutral</strong><br /> No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual  technology, specific part or component, material, or style of interface  or use thereof.</p>
<p><strong>Afterword</strong><br /> The signatories of this Open Source Hardware definition recognize that  the open source movement represents only one way of sharing information.  We encourage and support all forms of openness and collaboration,  whether or not they fit this definition.</p>
<p><strong>Licenses and Hardware</strong><br /> In promoting Open Hardware, it is important not to unintentionally  deceive designers regarding the extent to which their licenses actually  can control their designs. Under U.S. law, and law in many other places,  copyright does not apply to electronic designs. Patents do. The result  is that an Open Hardware license can in general be used to restrict the  plans but probably not the manufactured devices or even restatements of  the same design that are not textual copies of the original. The  applicable section of copyright law is 17.102(b), which says:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s called BitCoin and is a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency.  There is no central authority to issue new money or keep track of transactions (ie no Federal Reserve!).   This helps because the value of the bitcoin won&#8217;t go down because some central authority decides to print a few million bucks more.  You can exchange USD for bitcoin, and wherever <strong>bitcoin is accepted</strong>, you can use it to purchase whatever stuff/service you need. </p>
<p>Transactions are always free, unlike other online payment systems that may take anywhere from 1-5% per transaction + other fees.  Payment can be sent without middlemen or other third parties.  So you never have to worry about &#8220;big brother&#8221; keeping track of what you&#8217;re buying or selling.  OR preventing/controlling those transactions.</p>
<p>Payments are irreversible.  So if you send it, you&#8217;ve sent it.  If you&#8217;ve gotten bitcoin from a customer, you&#8217;ve gotten it.  And if you need a refund, the recipient can send it voluntarily as just another Send transaction.  These transactions can also be as anonymous as you want it to be.  &#8220;Transactions are only identified by your Bitcoin address and you can have as many as you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Security-wise, @whixr says I wouldn&#8217;t be able to understand it :).  So I&#8217;ll direct you to a few other sites that I believe have better ideas about the amount of security.  But from what I&#8217;ve read, it&#8217;s supposed to be even more secure than current online banking encryption.</p>
<p>Might be neat to check this out.   Here are some links to get you started:</p>

<p>I really like this series, mostly because I am self taught in this  arena, and I find that trying to explain stuff (as you are doing)  clarifies certain things, and makes you realize that you really don&#8217;t  know what you think you know.</p>
<p><em>Self taught FTW!  Fortunately I know that I don&#8217;t know anything :) It&#8217;s convincing myself that I&#8217;m still able to learn new things in fields I wouldn&#8217;t have caught myself dead trying to figure out two years ago!</em><br /><br />I think there are a couple of  misleading things above.   While it is called &#8220;Ohm&#8217;s law&#8221;, it isn&#8217;t  really a law.  Ohm&#8217;s law is the linear, constant relationship between  voltage and current, but many materials don&#8217;t exhibit such a constant  relationship.   For instance, a light bulb&#8217;s resistance actually varies  significantly with changes in voltage, because heating will actually  cause the resistance of  the filament to increase.  <br /><br /><a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Circuits_that_Do_not_obey_ohm%27s_law">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Circ&#8230;</a></p>
<p><em>I think when I was first trying to explain it, I was trying to just provide the basics without accounting for all of the contingencies.  I&#8217;m trying to &#8220;build up&#8221; as I go.  So when I learn something later that gives me a eureka moment, I make sure to address it, and come back to edit previous posts.  On resistance: I believe I have a post on resistors coming up shortly that&#8217;ll address the basics of temperature affecting resistors.</em></p>
<p>And  of course things like diodes or transistors don&#8217;t display linear  relationships between voltage and charge either, so we should be  careful.</p>
<p><em>Heh I&#8217;ll be getting to that!</em><br /><br />I also think that you are a teensy bit careless with  words that describe &#8220;speed&#8221;.  <strong>For instance, when you say that the &#8220;lower  the resistance, the faster the current can go through the material&#8221;,  it&#8217;s actually the rate that the charge can be moved through the resistor  that increases</strong>.   <strong>Current and charge aren&#8217;t the same thing: one ampere  of current for one second moves 1 coulomb of charge (6.24E18 electrons).   Lower resistance means that more electrons per second can move through  the resistor.   Lower resistance means more current can move through  the resistor. </strong></p>
<p><em>You are right, this is an important distinction to make.  I might want to warn the readers, I may get this wrong, because to make it easier on myself I&#8217;ve equated the two, but Current is almost the amount of electrons whereas speed has to do with the actual electrons/charge themselves.  (If I&#8217;m not mistaken).  I&#8217;ll put this note in the original post and edit accordingly! </em><br /><br />You are getting a bit ahead of yourself when you  talk about &#8220;power&#8221; too.   Since P = I E and E = I R, then P = I^2 R (or P  = E^2 / R).   When you say &#8220;the higher the resistance, the more voltage  you need to push through current&#8221;, it&#8217;s important to remember what you  are holding constant and what you are varying.</p>
<p><em>Oh hah, I wasn&#8217;t even thinking about power power, I was thinking of juice/oomph/probably voltage.  And in looking at your next example/drawing it out/etc - I think I was keeping current constant.  So to keep current going at the same rate&#8230;with a higher resistance, you&#8217;d require more voltage. And the less resistance, the less voltage.  Does that work?<br /></em></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s imagine a battery  and resistor hooked into a circuit, with the battery voltage being 1v  and the resistance being 100 ohms.   We can solve for the current (I = E  / R, or 0.01 amps).   If we increase the resistance to (say) 1000 ohms,  the current goes down to 0.001 amps).   The power dissipated by the two  circuits are just the voltage times current or 0.01 watts and 0.001  watts respectively.  <strong>Hence, increasing resistance actually _decreases_  the power and the current in the circuit. </strong></p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgcgblm4rE1qf00w4.png" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p><em>To be redundant: Voltage is being kept constant in this example.  When the resistance increased from 100 to 1000ohms, the amount of current going through decreased from 0.01 to 0.001 amps.  Increased resistance = decreased current.  When we look at how much power is going through the resistor with these specifications, the more resistance, the less power.</em></p>
<p>The situation which  you describe is to try to maintain the same current while increasing the  resistance.  In that case, you have to increase the voltage by the same  proportion.  </p>
<p><em>Sweet, I figured out what I was keeping constant before coming to this statement.  So yes, I was trying to keep the same current while increasing the resistance.  And that&#8217;s probably why I said that the higher the resistance, the higher the amount of voltage needed to push the current through.</em><br /><br />Is this being too pedantic?   I&#8217;ll stop if this isn&#8217;t helpful.</p>
<p><em>Nope, this was a great way for me to actually stop and smell the numbers.  I&#8217;ve been trying to avoid them and just take things from a theoretical point of view, but it seems that when I actually dive into the numbers, I discover eureka moments :p.  So if you would like to keep commenting/correcting me - I&#8217;ll keep using them as learning experiences!!  SUPER mucho thanks :)</em></p>

<p>Power is measured in watts which are abbreviated as W. </p>
<p>1) Power is the rate at which electrical energy is used.</p>
<p>2) Power is the product of voltage and current. (P = E x I)</p>
<p>3) The amount of power consumed is the <strong>load </strong>applied to a circuit.</p>
<ul><li>With Ohm&#8217;s Law (E = I x R)&#8230;you can substitute E and I with their relative equivalents</li>
</ul><p>P = E x I</p>
<p>P = <em>(I x R)</em> x I = <strong>P = I</strong><sup>2</sup><strong> x R           (Substituted E with I x R)<br /></strong></p>
<p>P = E x <em>(E / R)</em> = <strong>P = E</strong><sup>2</sup><strong> / R         (Substituted I with E / R)</strong></p>
<p>With those equations you can find out  how much power is being used in a circuit, or how many amps are flowing when voltage is x and load is y.</p>
<p>Blah blah.</p>
<p>AC/DC! </p>
<p>This is a bit of a more interesting topic.  It talks about the direction of current flow.  If the electrons flow in ONE direction, that&#8217;s DIRECT CURRENT - DC.  And current that regularly reverses direction is ALTERNATING CURRENT - AC.</p>
<p>So if you look at a voltmeter and check to see what the voltage is in a given circuit, and you see that it&#8217;s a constant +1.5v or 1.5v, you&#8217;ll know that it&#8217;s a DC voltage flowing through.  If however you see the voltage swinging between +1.5 and -1.5 within a short time, you&#8217;ll know that you&#8217;re dealing with an AC voltage.  In other words, DC voltage has the same polarity all of the time and AC voltage has regularly reversing polarity.</p>
<p>When off:</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfv2xth2Jf1qf00w4.gif" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>The circuit is broken so the electrons don&#8217;t have a path to travel on.</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfv2zvqSSd1qf00w4.gif" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>With the AC generator now linked - you see the electrons shifting back and forth - but still powering the light bulb.  Household power is AC power in the 50-60Hz range.</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfv30tF1Bp1qf00w4.gif" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>And batteries are DC voltage and you can see that the electrons move in only one direction - and light up the light bulb.</p>
<p>One cycle of AC involves:  AC flowing &#8212;&gt; stopping &#8212;&gt; reversing &#8212;&gt; and stopping again. (Think of a pendulum)</p>
<p>One cycle of AC <em>voltage</em> involves: Zero &#8212;&gt; AC voltage building up &#8212;&gt; Reversal to negative polarity &#8212;&gt; Return to zero.  This is a sine wave pattern, just like a radio signal.</p>

<ol><li><strong>For instance, when you say that the &#8220;lower  the resistance, the faster  the current can go through the material&#8221;,  it&#8217;s actually the rate that the charge can be moved through the resistor  that increases</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Current  and charge aren&#8217;t the same thing: one ampere  of current for one second  moves 1 coulomb of charge (6.24E18 electrons).   Lower resistance means  that more electrons per second can move through  the resistor.   Lower  resistance means more current can move through  the resistor. </strong></li>
</ol><p><em>My interpretation: So instead of saying <strong>Current can move FASTER</strong>.  It&#8217;s that <strong>MORE current can move</strong> through given less resistance or more voltage, etc.  On the other hand, <strong>Charge can move FASTER or SLOWER</strong> depending on less or more resistance, etcetc. </em><em> It&#8217;s like amount versus speed.  </em><em> Important subtleties!</em><strong><em><br /></em></strong></p>
<p>I was gonna put resistance is futile, but if you&#8217;ve ever had to deal with resistance, you know it&#8217;s not.  I mean, maybe your resistance against resistance is futile, but it certain isn&#8217;t.  <em>Chew your brain on THAT HAH.</em></p>
<p>So I jumped into this a little bit in earlier posts on series circuits when talking about the elements (or loads as engineers like to call em).  And depending on the element&#8217;s resistance to the current - or ability to keep it from moving forward - the element may have more or less voltage available for use.  And therein lies the definition - blocking the flow of electrons to some degree. </p>
<p><strong>Resistance</strong> is represented by <em>R</em> which is measured in <strong>ohms</strong> which is represented by the Greek letter <em>Omega</em> and measured with an ohmmeter.  <em>Kinda harkens back to how dumbly complex it is to explain current being measured in amps which is coulombs/sec.</em></p>
<p>Materials that have low resistance = do not impede current/the flow of electrons = <strong>conductors</strong>.  Copper&#8217;s good, salt water&#8217;s good - so that&#8217;s why PCB boards are copper clad.  It allows for the free flow of electrons! (Hippie.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, materials that resist or prevent current are known as <strong>insulators </strong>like glass, wood, paper, plastics.  You wouldn&#8217;t see a pcb board made out of cardboard or maple.  Maybe copper clad maple&#8230;.</p>
<p><em>@atdiy: &#8220;I have a question, if you have a copper clad building, and lightning strikes it. And you&#8217;re touching it.  Will you get electrocuted?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>@whixr: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think so, it&#8217;s connected to ground. Lightning rods and all that.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>@atdiy: &#8220;That&#8217;s too bad. That&#8217;d be kinda cool&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>An example: Resistance tells us something about how much energy  (voltage) you  need when you move <strike>current</strike> charge through an element, like a  bulb.  If you  need <em>lots</em> of energy then the <strong>resistance</strong> of the bulb is <em> high</em>.  If you  <em>don&#8217;t</em> need very much energy then <strong>resistance</strong> is <em>low</em>.</p>
<p>Another way of looking at resistance is to think about three bulbs with different resistances, each connected to 2 batteries.  All three  bulbs will have the same voltage across them but the current through  them will be different.</p>

<p>For a given voltage, the bulb with the lowest resistance will allow for the fastest charge (larger current) and therefore glow brighter.  And on the other hand, for that same voltage, the bulb with the highest resistance will prevent charge from flowing through as fast (smaller current) and will be the dimmest.</p>
<p><em><br /></em>Okay - back to the section.  There is of course a tenuous relationship between these three main things - voltage, current, and resistance - now known as <strong>Ohm&#8217;s Law</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Current is directly proportional to voltage and inversely proportional to resistance</strong></p>
<p><em>And I think the main thing is that this is relative to current and not to voltage.  IE it should read &#8220;Current is directly proportional to voltage.  Current is inversely proportional to resistance.&#8221;  Because this could theoretically be read as voltage is also inversely proportional to resistance, and that doesn&#8217;t work&#8230;And once I figured that out, it was easy to derive these &#8220;truths&#8221;.<br /></em></p>
<p>"Truths" that arise from this statement <em>(So qualified as there are qualifiers that may change such as the effects of temperature, conductor type, other elements such as capacitors/inductors/etc)</em>:</p>
<p>1) Resistance is the same regardless of current or voltage changes. </p>
<ul><li> Whether you change the voltage going to a material, or try to make electron charge go through faster, you&#8217;ll still have the same amount of resistance in a given material to deal with.  <em>This may even increase or decrease with temperature changes.</em></li>
</ul><p>2) A higher current means more voltage was made available.</p>
<ul><li>Or said in other terms, a higher voltage power source means that electron charge can run through a wire/conductor faster which means a higher amount of current can pass through.  Doubling the voltage = double the current. Tripling the voltage = tripling the current.</li>
</ul><p>3) The higher the resistance, the slower that charge (less current) goes through the material.</p>
<ul><li>As shown before with the light bulbs, if it has a high resistance to your power source, current can&#8217;t push its way through easily - and this may lead to dimmer light bulbs.</li>
</ul><p>4) The lower the resistance, the faster the charge (more current) can go through the material.</p>
<ul><li>Again with the previous example, if a light bulb has low resistance - and therefore excellent conductance - faster charge and more current can flow through easily and will most likely lead to a brightly lit light bulb.</li>
</ul><p>5) The higher the resistance, the more voltage you need to push through current if you want to keep current speeds the same regardless of resistance.</p>
<ul><li>So the more resistance an element has, the more power you need to be able to push through current as much as if there were lower resistance.  The power supply would have to be more powerful!</li>
</ul><p>6) The lower the resistance, the less voltage you need to push through current assuming you want to keep current levels the same.</p>
<ul><li>With less resistance, you don&#8217;t need as much power behind the current to get the current to move at the same amount.  More efficiency!</li>
</ul><p>And of course the equation itself:</p>
<p>E = IR</p>
<p>E being voltage&#8230;.I being current (amperage)&#8230;.and R being Resistance (ohms).  Usually you have two of the components and just need to solve for the remaining one - a tiny bit of pre-algebra.</p>

<p><strong>Serial</strong> &#8212;&gt; <em>Constant</em> current over the whole circuit but <em>varying </em>voltages depending on the elements ability to prevent the current from moving forward (ie resistance).</p>
<p><strong>Parallel </strong>&#8212;&gt; <em>Varying</em> current based on number of elements and their energy requirements.  You will find that there is constant voltage across similar elements (even if you keep adding to the number of elements present) as long as you don&#8217;t overwhelm the current capacity.</p>
<p><em>As far as I understand anyway</em>.</p>
<p>This helps to understand how the meters work for measuring voltage and amperage. </p>
<p><strong>Ammeter: </strong>To find current, you want to connect your  meter in series fashion.  That way the current flows through it - as  water through a dam - and you&#8217;re but that gate that&#8217;s measuring the  flow.  And it&#8217;ll need to be a very low-resistance meter to get the most  accurate reading as series circuits are affected by resistance-having  elements.</p>
<p><strong>Voltmeter: </strong>To find the voltage, you want to be able to link your meter in a <em>parallel</em> fashion because once your meter is in parallel fashion, it becomes just another element and you can see what kind of voltage amounts are being given to the other elements as well.</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfk2ir6MFD1qf00w4.png" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p><em>Ammeter on the left - Voltmeter on the right: This shows how they work being in series and parallel respectively.</em></p>
<p><strong>Multimeter: </strong>This rolls everything into one, including an Ohmmeter, which I&#8217;ll go into later.  This is an all-in-one exclusive package for 12.99 from your local hardware store and measures voltage, current, and resistance. <em>(Btw, no idea why they get so expensive so fast on Parts Express)</em><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><em>The example the manual gives is that if you&#8217;re measuring the resistance of a circuit and the reading starts out low but gradually increases, that could be a large value capacitor.</em></p>
<p>And it is possible to break a multimeter - which I didn&#8217;t know - if you&#8217;re trying to measure voltage or connecting the lines to an energized circuit when trying to measure resistance, that could damage a multimeter.  <em>I.e. watch what the meter&#8217;s on before sticking the red and black wires on a circuit!</em></p>

<p>The above is a multimeter.  I&#8217;ll write a post on how to use a multimeter once I learn about AC/DC and resistance :p&#8230;</p>

<p>The behavior of all these circuits can be understood a bit more formally by considering Ohms law (E = I R) and Kirchoff&#8217;s circuit laws.    These state that the sum of all currents into and out of any node in the  circuit must sum to zero (this is just conservation of charge) and that  the sum of the (signed) voltage drops must sum to zero for each loop  through the circuit.</p>
<p><em>By &#8220;all currents/voltage into and out of&#8221; you must mean the current/voltage going into a given node has a positive value to it and that same current/voltage coming out of the node has a negative value to it.   Since the current going into the circuit is essentially the same as the current coming out..<strike>.[thought processes kicking in]  Now. Does this actually work for resistors?</strike></em><strike><em>  Especially since resistors slow current down&#8230;so the current going in doesn&#8217;t equal the current going out and therefore the sum can&#8217;t be zero?</em>  </strike><em>The aforementioned were my initial thoughts until I finally realized that I wasn&#8217;t even calculating current correctly.  Either way, now that I&#8217;ve gotten it, yes this makes sense :)</em><br /><br />If you have a battery voltage feeding a pair  of light bulbs (which are really just resistors that emit light) in  parallel, the voltage drop around each of the two circuits must be the  same, and equal to the battery in magnitude.   However, the current is  split between the two, since the total current leaving the battery is  split into the two currents (which are equal when the bulbs present  equal resistance) so the current must be half the current supplied by  the battery.</p>
<p><em>This made sense. I think the way I explained it was that current increases up until the voltage can&#8217;t handle it? I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s accurate though.</em><br /><br />The case with two bulbs in series is similar.  The  total drop in voltage must be 1/2 the battery voltage (the circuit can  be thought of as a voltage divider).    The current around the circuit  is limited to the total series resistance (sum of the two bulb&#8217;s  resistance) and the voltage (I = E / R), but the entire current goes to  both bulbs.</p>
<p><em>Now that&#8217;s something I hadn&#8217;t come across - that the current around a series circuit is limited to the sum of the resistances in the series&#8230;I&#8217;ll have to ponder that a bit more.   I always thought that if you had a specific voltage, you&#8217;d get a certain current.  And the only reason it slowed down temporarily would be because of a resistor, but then it&#8217;d pick right back up.</em></p>
<p>Oh, one more thing about current limiting in batteries: imagine that you  have a battery, and you just dead short the leads together with a wire  of no (or very little) resistance.   Let&#8217;s say it has a resistance of  0.001 ohm and the battery is a classic D cell with a nominal 1.5v  potential.   <br /><br />We know from Ohm&#8217;s law that E = I R, so 1.5 = I  0.001, or I = 1500 amps.  We also know that P = I E, so the wire would  be drawing about 2250 watts of power.    What usually happens in the  case of a small wire is that the wire glows and burns out.<br /><br />But  what if the wire was (say) a very thick copper bar?   Copper&#8217;s  resistance is very low (microohms per cm), and putting 2250 watts of  power into a bar several inches thick wouldn&#8217;t mean a lot&#8230;.<br /><br />Well,  what happens then is the batteries own internal or series resistance  comes into play.   Again, the voltage across the battery is 1.5 volts,  and now the copper bar and the batteries own internal resistance are in  series.   The batteries own resistance is usually a fraction of an ohm  (say 100 milliohms) which is is 1000x the resistance of the circuit.   This means that in reality, the battery absorbs the vast bulk of the  power, which is dissipated as heat.  And yes, that&#8217;s very bad for your  batteries.<br /><br />This is essentially how fuses protect circuits: when  the current through them exceeds a certain value, they burn out to keep  the high currents from damaging other components in series.</p>
<p><em>Neat :p.  I&#8217;m always a little scared of working too much with the formulas while I&#8217;m learning something new.  I like to make metaphors for the formulas instead of crunching numbers (though it&#8217;ll eventually be something I need to do obviously).</em></p>
<p><em>Many thanks for your comments!  Perhaps I&#8217;m making series vs parallel too complicated/adding too much drama to it :p.  But one day, a light bulb will go on and I&#8217;ll get it completely :)<br /></em></p></div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass"

<p>If two or more light bulbs are connected so that the same voltage is present across all of them, that is a <strong>parallel circuit</strong>.</p>
<p>[PAUSE] <em>I&#8217;d like to note that voltage and current is kinda like apples and oranges to me still. </em><em>Current  again measuring the number of electrons (coulombs/sec = amps) that  pass  through any given point per second, and Voltage being the electric   potential between two points. <br /></em></p>

<p>This is a series circuit, where the &#8220;elements&#8221; are in a series -   Bulbs 1, 2, 3 - and the electrons only have one direction to travel in.    The current through each of these elements is the same but the voltage   is &#8220;shared&#8221; across each of the elements.  Assuming the light bulbs are   the same, the more light bulbs you add, the less voltage each light   bulbs gets to use:</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lffw8m9WdJ1qf00w4.png" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>So  with one and two bulbs, 120volts are enough to light both  situations  up, but as soon as you add a third bulb, 40volts per light  bulb isn&#8217;t  enough to light them as brightly. <em> ﻿</em>Sometimes   people explain it as the amount of voltage decreasing each time the   current passes through an element (such as a light bulb), but I think   that ends up confusing people because then it sounds like each   subsequent light bulb should be dimmer and dimmer as the previous light   bulb sucks up the power it wants.  And that&#8217;s not how it works   apparently.﻿An example:</p>

<p>So  here, you have one bulb that requires more energy to light up.   The key  to understanding how this works is that POSITION DOES NOT  MATTER.  If  the 10watt bulb were in any other position, it&#8217;d still suck  up that much  power, and it&#8217;d still be the only one that was lit up.   At first this  confused me because I was like &#8220;Oh well, it&#8217;s the closest  to the power  source, so of course, it gets more power&#8221;, but that&#8217;s not  it at all,  it&#8217;s just relative to how much resistance it has - or how  much can it  prevent the current from moving on to the next element.</p>
<p>This is different when you&#8217;re hooking batteries up in series:</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lffvixg2P41qf00w4.gif" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>So  here, the batteries are each worth 1.5V of power, and when you  place  them in series, with one of your voltmeter wires hooked to each  end of  the arrows - one wire on the yellow line and the other wire to  the green  line - you get the addition of those battery voltages to give  you 6V of  potential energy you can use to power a light bulb.  But the  current is  the same - the electrons still move as fast as they did when  they first  went into the loop.  A battery company online stated this: &#8220;A light bulb with this setup will burn very brightly, but for a short amount of time.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Parallel Circuits</strong></p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lffphfH45R1qf00w4.png" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>With this parallel circuit, the current gets split up among all of the potential paths but the voltage sent to each element stays the same.  Here, the 9V would be sent to the first, to the second, and to the third bulb in its entirety.</p>
<p><em><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lffz7wTa1D1qf00w4.png" alt="image" /></p></em></p>
<p>No matter the number of lights/elements you add here, they will always receive the 120volts the power source says it&#8217;ll give.  <em>How is this accomplished?</em> Current (Amperage) from the  source increases each time another element is added to the circuit in  parallel. So, it&#8217;s very easy to keep adding elements in parallel and end up overloading a circuit by requiring more  current to flow than the circuit can safely handle. </p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s say the power supply isn&#8217;t from the wall, it&#8217;s from some piddly 9V battery.  <em>What happens when the amperage is more than the battery can handle? </em>Well&#8230;the battery gets hot and potentially damaged - I think is the general consensus&#8230;</p>
<p>And again this is different when looking at batteries in parallel:</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lffvqbOVTN1qf00w4.gif" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>The battery company states: &#8220;A lightbulb with this set up will burn much less brightly but 4 times as long.&#8221;  So I guess here you have 4x the amount of current that provides 1.5 volts throughout.  As opposed to 1x the amount of current with 6 volts in one go. </p>

<p>Gel electrophoresis is a method of separating out fragments of DNA, RNA, or even protein by BOTH size and charge.  This is done in a porous gel medium and involves an electrical current being run from negative to positive. </p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfew7aBmrF1qf00w4.gif" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>This works because DNA architecture, for example, includes a sugar-phosphate backbone which confers negative charge onto that particular DNA molecule.  This is shown here by the O-&#8230;&#8221;-&#8221; for negative charge.  And the gel itself is porous, meaning that there are different sized holes.  Molecules that are small enough can go through these holes - but! they need motivation, motivation in the form of an electrical current.</p>
<p>So, when you put an electrical current through: one end becoming negative and the other positive, molecules that are negative in charge will move towards the positive charge, but only up to a certain point. That point being their size.</p>
<p>The larger molecules get trapped closer to where they first entered the gel matrix, and the smaller molecules are able to move farther and faster along towards the positive pole of the gel.</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfevv8Z3tQ1qf00w4.jpg" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of how it works - you have wells where you put your DNA samples + enzymes that break up the DNA at certain known points to make fragments.  And when you run a current through the gel, larger fragments get stuck behind whilst smaller fragments go farther along.  Usually, the lane on the left is the &#8220;reference&#8221; DNA - that is perhaps, the DNA found at the scene.  And the other lanes are suspects&#8217; DNA.  And what you do, is match up the bands between your suspects and the reference DNA, and bam! You find a match with Suspect 3!</p>
<p><p><img class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfexbsTdIr1qf00w4.jpg" alt="image" /></p></p>
<p>Did I mention it&#8217;s super fun to stick DNA into wells? It&#8217;s such a satisfying thing to be able to properly pipette colored DNA into a tiny space and see it settling.</p>
<p>Cool thing also is sometimes they use reference DNA with KNOWN numbers of DNA sizes - known as x number of base pairs.  So you can even find out through using gel electrophoresis how many base pairs an unknown DNA fragment has. As seen below! Those upper bands look like they&#8217;re about 410 base pairs and the lower bands look like they&#8217;re around 125 base pairs? Give or take anyway.</p>

<p>According to the manual:</p>
<p>"The Earth&#8217;s surface acts as a universal reference for voltage measurements and is called earth ground, ground potential, or just ground."</p>
<p>What I understand about ground from just general life knowledge is that if lightning strikes your house, all of your appliances being  connected to ground (ie wire/pipes that actually go into the ground)  means that the electricity will try its damndest to get into the ground instead of into you or me. Path of least resistance essentially.</p>
<p>But my main questions have been:</p>
<p>1) What does it mean for ground to be a reference point for voltage measurements?</p>
<p>2) How do you measure ground with a multimeter&#8230;I mean, what&#8217;re you supposed to see?</p>
<p>From here the progression of thought has been as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Some explanations I&#8217;ve seen say that this provides a voltage level  against which all other voltages in a system are established and  measured.  <em>What&#8217;s its voltage level then?</em></li>
<li>(Tech-faq.com) Ground is a source of unlimited charge that remains at 0 volts. &#8220;It is the point from which all other potential differences in a circuit  are measured, and can be used as the return path for current in a  circuit.&#8221;  <em>So how do you measure that difference?</em></li>
<li>(epanorama.net) There are many sources of electricity. Every transformer can be considered a separate source. If there were not a common reference point for all these voltage sources it would be extremely difficult to calculate their relationships to each other. The earth is the most omnipresent conductive surface, and so it was adopted in the very beginnings as a nearly universal standard for all electric systems. </li>
<li>(UPenn) Early developers of electrical systems theorized that the earth was an electrically neutral body, i.e. an equal number of negative and positive charges are distributed throughout the earth at any given time. Being electrically neutral, earth is considered to be at zero potential and establishes a convenient reference frame for voltage measurements. Noting that voltmeters read only the difference in potential between two points, absolute measurements can be made by using earth as a reference. </li>
<li>(@whixr) If everything in the world had a slight negative charge, you&#8217;d think that was considered a Zero voltage, but when you have a reference point that actually does not have a potential, you can tell that these are actually slightly negative, or whatever. </li>
</ul><p>I kinda understand it now. Hopefully you do too, but let me know if I need to come up with some wacky sort of metaphor to get it rolling.</p>
