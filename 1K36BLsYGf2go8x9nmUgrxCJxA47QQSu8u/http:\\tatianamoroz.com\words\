<p><strong>Profile from the liberterrain…</strong></p>
<p>Tatiana Moroz is a young sultry-voiced songstress who bills herself as &#8220;A singer-songwriter who fights for love, liberty, freedom, and peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sound too good to be true?</p>
<p>The Libertarian News Examiner went looking behind the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TatianaMorozMusic?sk=info" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.facebook.com']);">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.tatianamoroz.com/" >website</a> promotions, behind the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TatianaMorozMusic?sk=photos" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.facebook.com']);">photo galleries</a>, behind the <a href="http://noisetrade.com/tatianamoroz" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://noisetrade.com']);">professional and personal biographies</a>, and behind <a href="../?page_id=72">the music</a> (&#8220;Pop infused with Blues, Country, Soul, and Rock&#8221;) in search of her libertarian creds.</p>
<p>While her father, &#8220;a fantastic singer who even sang at Carnegie Hall&#8221; Moroz told the <a href="http://www.examiner.com/libertarian-news-in-national/garry-reed" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.examiner.com']);">Libertarian News Examiner</a> in an exclusive interview, may have influenced her musically, it was her mother, &#8220;who is from Warsaw, Poland and moved here in the late 70&#8242;s,&#8221; who taught her an early political lesson.</p>
<p>At age 5 or 6 Moroz told her, &#8220;Mom, why don&#8217;t we make a society where everyone works and they share what they make? This way everyone can have stuff equally and everyone will be happy and have enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her Mother&#8217;s reply was, &#8220;Sorry Taniusz, but that&#8217;s Communism, and it doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p>
<p>That set her on a freedom path from reading &#8220;<em>1984</em>, <em>Brave New World</em>, <em>Animal Farm</em>, and <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> in high school&#8221; to attending the <a href="http://politicalconferences.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://politicalconferences.org']);">International Students For Liberty Conference</a> in February where she listened to &#8220;Austrian Economics and formal libertarian teachings&#8221; to singing for the <a href="http://cvrp2012.com/2012/03/06/my-lessons-from-the-veterans-for-ron-paul-march-on-the-white-house/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://cvrp2012.com']);">Veterans for Ron Paul march on the White House</a> on Presidents Day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I admit I was a little overwhelmed,&#8221; she said of the ISFLC event. &#8220;Here is a whole generation of bright students who already had a firm background in Rothbard, Mises, and more. I realized I was not as fortunate. Most of my education has come from films, Audiobooks and friends who are further along the path.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moroz is still growing and learning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not bound to any party,&#8221; she insists, but &#8220;I certainly have found myself identifying more and more with the libertarian mindset for the past couple years.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s reflected in her music.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of my most known songs is my version of &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxxcqXSx2dQ" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);">Masters of War</a>&#8221; by Bob Dylan which I covered for the Combat Veterans for Ron Paul,&#8221; she offers. &#8220;Another song I feel best encompasses my message is &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1HZE3BKo0Q" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);">Make a Youtube Video</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ron Paul reportedly said, &#8220;I always knew that if you were going to have a revolution you needed two things: Young people and music.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tatiana Moroz has both those requirements covered.</p>

				<h1>The Tatiana Moroz Interview: Five questions that will tell you a little bit about CVRP’s favorite Lady of Liberty</h1>

<p>”Recently, I have been doing a lot of press, which has been a lot of fun.  However, sometimes everything I have to say is not conveyed, so here I am laying out some info about how I got involved with the Ron Paul movement and why I do what I do….”</p>
<p>-Tatiana Moroz</p>
<p><a href="http://cvrp2012.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/ztma.jpg" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://cvrp2012.files.wordpress.com']);"><img title="Tatiana" src="http://cvrp2012.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/ztma.jpg?w=300&amp;h=296" alt="%Album Release Party" width="300" height="296" /></a></p>
<p><strong><em>It’s pretty obvious that you’re a Ron Paul supporter, but do your beliefs go beyond Ron Paul?  Do you consider yourself a Libertarian? </em></strong></p>
<p>I am not bound to any party.  I try to form opinions based on the issues and the candidates, and that is how I have always felt.  Without a doubt, I certainly have found myself identifying more and more with the Libertarian mindset for the past couple years.  As far as I am concerned, mind your own business, be responsible for yourself, and don’t hurt anyone.  I think that’s a belief system that people from all backgrounds and all over the world can identify with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>What were your social/political beliefs before you discovered libertarianism?</em></strong></p>
<p>I have a distinct memory of being around 5 or 6 and going to my mom with my idea.  I said something like, “Mom, why don’t we make a society where everyone works and they share what they make?  This way everyone can have stuff equally and everyone will be happy and have enough.”  My mom, who is from Warsaw, Poland and moved her in the late 70′s, said, “Sorry Taniusz, but that’s Communism, and it doesn’t work”.   I found out at an early age just how influential music could be on the way the world worked.  I grew up listening to Cat Stevens, Simon and Garfunkel, The Beatles, and Bob Dylan (although my father is a fantastic singer who was offered an appearance on Johnny Carson), I can thank my mom for getting me into the old singer-songwriters from the 60′s and 70′s).  I remember thinking the music from that generation was so vibrant, and in no small part because of the turmoil and the revolution taking place back then. People were inspired, and in turn inspiring one another to change and grow.  I was jealous, and disappointed that my own generation seemed so disinterested.  I voraciously read 1984, Brave New World, Animal Farm, and Fahrenheit 451 in high school, and I was motivated to find a solution to the problems of mankind’s organization.  I would think a lot about how society was organized, and I wanted to make things better.  However, I saw through the ruse and didn’t trust in any politicians or political parties.  The music of the early 2000′s then took a downward spiral.  Too much Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, and not enough quality and substance.  This infuriated me to no end.  I guess the point here is that I saw all along how important music was to define the goals and progress of a generation, and so I chose music over an acting career, or even journalism or writing.  Music has the power to transcend so many barriers and bring people together.  It has the power to create genuine change better than any one person in office.  Plus it feels wonderful!<br />
<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Who has influenced you the most, and what have you been reading lately?</em></strong></p>
<p>I recently went to the ISFLC in DC over President’s Day weekend.  I really enjoyed the lectures, especially by the Cato Institute.  As a somewhat new student to Austrian Economics and formal Libertarian teachings, I admit I was a little overwhelmed.   Here is a whole generation of bright students who already had a firm background in Rothbard, Mises, and more.  I realized I was not as fortunate.  Most of my education has come from films, audiobooks, and friends who are further along the path.  My friend John (a former Marine who served in Iraq) knows a lot about all of this, and would come over and talk with me for hours about “how things really work”.  He inspired me to delve deeper into Ron Paul as well, who I think is a living example of how we should conduct ourselves and what a life of true principle really looks like.  I think Dr. Paul’s teachings are a good summary of all the great thinkers before him, and is a great introduction into how to organize things.  That mindset has given me a renewed faith in mankind.  I think it solves the problems I used to mull over in my teenage years and provides a real solution to people’s differences.  When I go to the Liberty events, I see people from all backgrounds coming together with one common goal.  I think this is something that can be shared worldwide.  The US used to inspire people from other countries.  I would like to see us get back to those roots, starting with the Constitution.</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago, I spoke with another singer-songwriter from the movement, a good friend of mine, Jordan Page.  He mentioned that what we are dealing with is not really a revolution, it’s a Renaissance.  He’s right.  We are not exactly reinventing the wheel here.  The founding fathers saw the importance of freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, the rights to private property, the right to peacefully assemble in protest, and the right to a fair trail.  All of these things are vanishing before our very eyes, at an alarming rate.  They also made provisions ensuring that wars would be not entered into lightly at the whim of the executive branch.  They made sure that war had to be declared through Congress.  So when I speak of Revolution in my new song “Evolution To Revolution,”  I suppose I misspeak to a certain degree.  I am trying to get people to realize that we already have the road map of how to get back to what made the US prosper and become the envy of the world (the US Constitution).  We are conscious beings, and we have the power within us to direct the course of history.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have The Law by Bastiat and Tom Wood’s Politically Incorrect Guide to American History in my queue.  I am listening to Henry Hazlitt’s Economics in One Lesson on audiobook and I just finished re-reading 1984 (so much scarier as an adult!)<br />
<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Where am you in the libertarian world – small government, anarchist, voluntaryist, anarcho-capitalist, other?</em></strong></p>
<p>I believe in small government.  If everyone was similar, and had the same values, maybe some alternatives could be created, but I believe in a republic.<br />
<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What songs/lyrics of yours do you consider best reflect your libertarian beliefs?</em></strong></p>
<p>I mentioned “Evolution To Revolution” before.  One of my most known songs is my version of “Masters Of War” by Bob Dylan which I covered for <a href="http://cvrp2012.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://cvrp2012.com']);" target="_blank">CVRP</a>.  This incredible song and its message is really important to me.   I learned a lot from performing it, and from talking with so many brave veterans.  They were courageous defenders of freedom, but they were disillusioned when they realized they were only over there to do the bidding of chicken hawks and corrupt politicians.  They didn’t feel that the blood of their brothers and sisters was spilt for a purpose.  The people I have spoken to feel that they are doing far more harm than good.  The wars are endless and unconstitutional.  There is rampant suicide among veterans and active duty military, and we as a nation need to listen to our troops we say we support so much.  Instead of getting a yellow ribbon, or wearing an Army T-shirt, listen to what they have to say, and ask yourselves, “Why do they give more money to Ron Paul than any other candidate combined?”  I am proud to be a part of the CVRP family and the writing team at <a href="http://cvrp2012.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://cvrp2012.com']);">CVRP2012.com</a> is impressive, and gets to the heart of the soldier’s plight today.  In fact, their stories have inspired me so much, that I am in the studio now recording a new song called “Playin The Cards” that is all about war and what it REALLY means.</p>
<p>“Let It Go” (to be released on my new album coming out in the next month)  expresses how I think we all need to chill a little bit.  There are a lot of stressful experiences in the life of the freedom fighter.  However, I think we need to remember that we’re not going to change everyone’s mind, and arguing with every troll on Facebook is not going to get us to where we need to be.  I think we need to remember that life is short and the pursuit of happiness needs to be kept firmly in our minds.  If we can’t do this with a smile on our face (at least some of the time), then we are letting the bad guys win!  Life is beautiful, and it’s a gift to be alive at this exciting time!</p>
<p>Finally, I think the song that best encompasses my message is “Make A YouTube Video”.  The verses are about the frustration we feel as a seemingly helpless people.  However, the message is about hope.  For the first time in the history of mankind, we really do have “the power to ask the questions.  We can finally the truth.  Turn to each other, sister and brother, reach out to one another.”  That is the difference between now and hundreds of generations before us.  We have the INTERNET!  Obviously mainstream media is so consolidated that it cannot be trusted for fair and balanced news.  So we go online, anywhere in the world, and connect.  We are not all so different, in fact, we are all quite similar.  I have a great love for my fellow man, and I know that we can certainly come up with something better than what is being shoved down our throats.  But when in the bridge I talk about a hero, I don’t overtly say Ron Paul.  I want people to come up with their own conclusions.  I am not the all knowing book of answers.  Far from it.  However, we are able to do our own research, and make up our own minds.  The information is out there if you can only get people to be inspired to LOOK!   I think that when people really think about libertarian ideas, they do realize that they provide a realistic solution that doesn’t force the tyranny of the majority upon anyone.  But that’s not my selling point.  I want people to remember their relationships with one another, to remember to trust in their friends, and to talk peacefully about how to get things right in this country, and the world.  So to quote the song again “Call up a friend, send a message.  Tweet it up, or make a YouTube video.  Speak your mind, with education.  The knowledge will start to grow.  So make a YouTube video!”</p>

				<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I hope this finds you well.  I have been super busy (what else is new) but with all great things!   I have been in the studio with Will recording new songs.  The newest one is “Evolution To Revolution” which is going to be released any day.  It was originally “Evolution” track 9 on my album Tatiana.  I wrote it about the hope I have that people become aware of the control they have over their lives.  That we have the power to control our evolution as conscious beings to make the world a better place.  Since I have been doing all acoustic recordings lately and continue to be inspired, I wanted to rework it about the Revolution now going on across the nation.  We move forward and I have faith.  Other tunes will be released soon about love, life and liberty so keep an eye out J</p>
<p>I am going to be on LibertyChat.com tonight with a number of guests including a personal favorite Tom Woods.  It’s free to listen in, you just have to register.  It will be a live chat where you can write in your questions and I will answer, followed with 2 performances:  “Masters of War” and “Make a Youtube Video” from Premier Studios in NY.  I go on at 8:30 EST SHARP, so I hope you can join me at <a href="http://libertychat.com/chat" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://libertychat.com']);" target="_blank">http://libertychat.com/chat</a></p>
<p>After that, I will be on with Adam House and Nick Allison of CVRP talking about the Veterans March on the RNC in Tampa in support of Ron Paul.  This is at 11pm EST and can be found here:  <a href="http://www.thepyramidrecordingcollective.com/live__culture_fix" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.thepyramidrecordingcollective.com']);" target="_blank">http://www.<wbr>thepyramidrecordingcollective.</wbr></a></p>
<p>On March 27, I will be joining in on the “Dangerous Conversations” Radio show at 9pm.  http://www.radioio.com/btls/2011/06/13/dangerous-conversation/</p>
<p>I have a few gigs lined up including Culture Fix on March 28 in NY as well as the New England Liberty LOVE Fest in Worchester, MA on April 28.  All my gigs can be found on my page and I will be sure to keep it updated!</p>
<p>Do you want free music?  Do your friends want free music?  I just joined a new musical platform Noisetrade where I am giving away three songs for free “Make A Youtube Video”, a live cover of “Knockin On Heaven’s Door” which I did as a request to CVRP2012.com and a live version of “Castle To Defend” (originally on my album “Tatiana”).  You just go to this link <a href="http://noisetrade.com/tatianamoroz" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://noisetrade.com']);">http://noisetrade.com/tatianamoroz</a> and you put in your email.  You also have the option of making a donation to me, which would be appreciated to help pay for all these excursions and musical ventures J  Not necessary in any way though, I know money is tight for people!</p>
<p>Finally, I wrote some new blogs found here on <a href="http://www.tatianamoroz.com/" >www.TatianaMoroz.com</a>  (which will soon be getting a total facelift!).</p>
<p>I guess that’s all for now, but I hope all of you are doing well and getting excited for the beautiful Spring just around the corner!  Thank you for all your continued support, and if you like what you hear, spread it around J  I can’t do it without you!</p>
<p>Love and Liberty,</p>
<p>Tatiana</p>

				<p>Hi,<br />
I recently was invited to write for the CVRP2012.com website (Combat Veterans for Ron Paul 2012 aka Revolution Free Press). It is an honor to be invited, and it&#8217;s also a great creative outlet. I haven&#8217;t written anything like this since um&#8230; high school? Felt a bit like an essay, but it&#8217;s from the heart and I hope that it brings people a bit closer together! Hope you enjoy it and feel free to share it (and send people to check out the other amazing articles on their site.) The contributors are not only brave freedom fighters, they are talented writers in their own right and I am thrilled to count myself as a member of the family! Special Thanks also to Adam Kokesh, Nathan Cox, Gigi Bowman, and Ian Cioffi for putting together the march and after-party respectively.</p>

<p>Reflections on The Veterans for Ron Paul March on D.C.<br />
Posted on March 2, 2012</p>
<p>by Tatiana Moroz</p>
<p>Dear readers and lovers of liberty, </p>
<p>A week ago, I went to DC for the Ron Paul is the Choice of the Troops March on the White House. I recall sitting on the bus en route, thinking I would leave with a whole bunch of new friends and fantastic memories. I was absolutely right. It was a weekend I will never forget.   </p>
<p>I also went down there for the International Students for Liberty Conference. I enjoyed the lectures (especially the ones from the CATO institute), and seeing all those students studying the ideas of Mises, Rothbard, and Rand was invigorating. However, as wonderful as that part of the trip was, it only served as a warm up to what followed. </p>
<p>On Saturday morning, I found out I came in fourth place in the Troop March Youtube video contest. I was ecstatic! It wasn’t because of the $100 prize, of course (although, who doesn’t like a little pocket money?).  Instead, it was for the unexpected opportunity to sing for some of the bravest men and women I have ever had the pleasure to meet. It was the chance to make history on Presidents Day 2012 in our Nation’s Capital. I had a cold, it WAS cold, but I couldn’t have cared less. This was the gig of a lifetime! For the first time, I was truly awake to the greatness that is this country. I had been to DC before when I was a child, but what did I know? George Washington chopped down the cherry tree, Lincoln lived in a log cabin, and Ben Franklin discovered electricity. Now, as an adult woman, I understood what those men and their actions really did stand for, and what they had intended for us as a nation. And now, I was one of the chosen people allowed to be the voice for this generation of freedom fighters! The word “honor” just didn’t seem to have enough weight to it. I’m not sure any words can express my sincere feelings of utter gratitude for this experience. </p>
<p>So what happened? On a crisp and sunny day, at the base of the Washington Monument, I sang for the crowd of over 1,000 people. We had some technical difficulties, so upon James’ (Golden State’s singer) prompting , I went acoustic. I was a little worried, but everyone crowded in, and I serenaded them with a song very close to my heart, and to the hearts of CVRP, as well. Bob Dylan’s “Masters Of War” is a powerhouse, and I can only hope I did it justice. Afterward, I was a little shook up (who wouldn’t be after something so overwhelming!), but I was able to enjoy James’ and Jordan Page’s performances. On a high, we all got into place (I was a marshall with Tracy Allison–another contributor to CVRP–so we got to wear uber-sexy neon orange vests). We marched to the White House among our fellow Americans, chanting “President Paul! President Paul!” There was an estimate of 430 veterans in the formation. </p>
<p>Upon arriving at the White House, our veterans and active military service members turned their backs to symbolically signify that they didn’t condone all these unconstitutional wars. I want to be clear here. These are BRAVE people who enlisted voluntarily. They were willing to DIE to protect this country.  However, these wars have ceased to provide them with a sense of a genuine purpose. Instead, we have an army of reluctant nation builders  who die needlessly, and occupy foreign nations that don’t want or need us there, while our borders at home remain unprotected. All of this, so the military-industrial complex can continue to feed greedily on the blood of our soldiers, and on the blood of the nations we invade to “promote democracy.” </p>
<p>There was an eight-minute hand salute for every active duty military member who had committed suicide under Obama (one second for each life taken: approximately 480). These numbers are higher than they have ever been, especially when you include veterans. There were also 21 minutes of silence observed for those fallen in battle (one second for each life lost:  approximately 1,260). Some may ask, why only during the Obama administration? Honestly, if we were including the Bush administration, we would have been there a lot longer. Also, Obama ran on a platform of peace. We have not seen that peace, only the usurping of more and more unconstitutional presidential powers that eat away at the core of this nation’s values.   </p>
<p>There were very little “official” news outlets present. We had hoped for more, although I guess we should have expected that this, too, would go unreported. However, the independent press people were out in droves, and the tourists seemed to support what we were doing. Drivers passing by honked their horns, smiled, and offered their thumbs up. I can only hope they shared this message that is so clearly being blacked out in mainstream media.   </p>
<p>We continued to march around the city behind this brave battalion. Our cries of “End The Fed!” echoed through the streets as we continued our glorious trek through the city. We finally ended at the foot of the Washington Monument. This time we ran up its green hills, waving the American flag. I know each and every one of us felt like we were following in the footsteps of our revered forefathers. I think they would have been proud of our bravery and fortitude.   </p>
<p>Now it was time for the party! Jordan Page was kind enough to invite me to sing two songs with him. We opened with “Listen” (my personal favorite), and “Message of Freedom,” which is a touching song he wrote to his sons. The crowd seemed to love it, and cheered with hope in their eyes. I would like to mention that Jordan Page is one of the kindest and most wonderful people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He made me feel welcome, and totally supported my first endeavor into the world of the liberty singers. He is a class act, and I can’t say enough about how cool he is, and what a genuine person I found him to be. He even lent me his guitar (if you’re a musician you know what a big deal it is to let someone else handle your “baby”), and when Ian Cioffi invited me to sing solo (again totally unexpected), he accompanied me on “Knockin On Heaven’s Door.” Adam Kokesh then flattered me by insisting on an encore performance featuring my new  song “Make A Youtube Video”. For those of you who don’t know it, it is a song with a dear place in my heart. It is my first official Ron Paul song, and its message reflects my steadfast belief that it is incumbent upon US to educate ourselves and others We no longer need the mainstream media; we ARE the media. “WE have the power to ask the questions, we can finally find the truth. Turn to each other, sister and brother, reach out to one another.”  </p>
<p>Perhaps I should break from my tale of “Best Day Ever” to reflect upon that. When I got off the stage smiling like crazy, I was surrounded by brave men and women thanking me for my service. Are you guys kidding? I thought. I get to sing on stage while you are putting yourselves in harms way to protect a nation that barely remembers its founding principles, and you are thanking me? The love that was displayed in this room was remarkable and incredible.  The gratitude that we all showed each other, the appreciation, and the connection that we all established is something that NO ONE can take away from us. When we’re at home, and hear the sleeping tell us over and over again that “Ron Paul isn’t electable,” or that his “Foreign policy is insane,” we will wrap ourselves in these memories we created together. This family of growing numbers can follow one another on Twitter, become friends on Facebook, and check out each other’s blogs and Youtube videos. We CAN spread the message, and gather strength from one another…. </p>
<p>OK, so enough of my sappy reflections (although, I can’t guarantee there won’t be more). After my performance, I was in the hallway, and I met Aimee Allen! Holy cannoli, my heroine! She hugged me with sincerity, and actually complimented ME?! Really, Aimee? I couldn’t believe it. She was beautiful, and her performance exceeded every expectation I had. </p>
<p>When I had the honor of meeting the CVRP men (and Tracy, who is a trooper in her own right), as well as the rest of the vets and active-duty service members, and the opportunity to hear some of their stories, I knew I was on the right path. Before, I had no real concept of their sacrifices; now, I feel lucky for having learned something about them. I was given the chance to enrich my life, and my understanding of the true meaning of war. What a gift this was! Nick, Adam, Grady and Zak are not only soldiers and marines who fought overseas; they are men who took a risk by writing so eloquently about the truth of what was happening, while the rest of us kicked back and watched the Superbowl and American Idol.   </p>
<p>By the way, did I mention how COOL Jordan was? I think I did, but it really does bear repeating. He serves as a template of what an artist within the liberty movement should be. This guy is the king of the Ron Paul music scene, and consistently cranks out the message in a positive way that makes us all proud to count him among our ranks. Golden State also showed me great kindness and support, and when they called me up to sing their song “Bombs” with Adam, Jordan, and the CROWD, I had to fight back tears of incredulity and gratitude. </p>
<p>What all of this brings me to is that, despite the danger, despite the isolation that is inherent in breaking from the pack, I had to put it all on the line, because that’s what this was about. The armed service members did it, Aimee did it, Jordan did it, Golden State, Rebel Inc, Adam Kokesh and Nathan Cox all did it. EVERYONE IN THAT ROOM, and EVERYONE WATCHING IN THEIR LIVING ROOM, was putting it on the line! This was OUR movement. There was no time for cowardice. There was only time to take back what was rightfully bestowed upon us by our founding fathers, and God. We were there to support Ron Paul, the single bravest and most principled statesman I have ever known of in my lifetime. However, it was not just about Dr. Paul (and he would be the first to admit that). It was about each and every one of us lighting the flame of liberty, and feeding it with our actions. We sing liberty; we write it, speak it, tweet it, and stand in the cold shouting about it! It belongs to each and every one of us, and the time is NOW.</p>
<p>Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. -Martin Luther King Jr.    </p>
<p>I hope you have enjoyed my story of the March on Washington by the Troops who support Dr. Paul. I have been invited to write occasionally for the CVRP2012.com site, also known as the Revolution Free Press. I may not be a political commentator, but I am entitled to my voice. I am honored by this invitation, and look forward to sharing my experiences and thoughts from my mind and heart. I hope you enjoy reading about them! Love and Liberty! </p>
<p>Peace,</p>

				<p>I was honored with this lovely article by this fantastic team of veterans from the Combat Veterans For Ron Paul website (www.CVRP2012.com) and thought I would share it with you.  Here is a link to the song referenced below on Itunes:</p>

<h1>Masters of War: Tatiana Moroz, Ron Paul and Music for the Revolution (Video)</h1>
<div>Posted on <a title="11:59 PM" href="http://cvrp2012.com/2012/02/13/masters-of-war-tatiana-moroz-ron-paul-and-music-for-the-revolution/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://cvrp2012.com']);" rel="bookmark">February 13, 2012</a></div>
<p>13 Feb 2012<br />
by Nick Allison</p>
<p>When I think of my time in the Army, in Iraq and otherwise, it is hard to imagine what it would have been like without music. War and music go hand in hand, whether for soldiers gathered around a beat up radio in the rear during WWII, listening to Glenn Miller and his Orchestra’s latest swing hit; or grunts in Vietnam chilling out while listening to Armed Forces Radio and the Rock n’ Roll hits so closely related to that particular war. The Animals, CCR, Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane and Neil Young – many of the songs most popular among the troops in the field had a common anti-war theme. <em>We gotta get out of this place…<a href="http://cvrp2012.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/animalsthe.jpg" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://cvrp2012.files.wordpress.com']);"><img title="Animals+The" src="http://cvrp2012.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/animalsthe.jpg?w=301&amp;h=252" alt="%Album Release Party" width="301" height="252" /></a></em></p>
<p>Today’s troops are no different. Music plays as big a role in war as do bullets and bombs. While we were in Iraq in 2004, we used to joke about how much we were getting ripped off in “War Music.” The Vietnam war had all the good shit while we were often stuck with mass produced, formulaic pop. Not that we didn’t have plenty of bands that we enjoyed – Flogging Molly, The Dropkick Murphys, Rage Against the Machine, Ben Kweller, Social Distortion, Cross Canadian Ragweed and Jeff Buckley come instantly to mind – but we also recycled “Vietnam Music.” In particular, at least for me, Bob Dylan played a huge role in getting us through the desert. <em>The Times They Are A-Changin’, Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door</em> and <em>Masters of War</em> seemed to be telling us something.</p>
<p><em>Masters of War</em> in particular stands as perhaps the greatest and most accurate of Dylan’s anti-war songs. In it, he calls out the politicians and armchair generals who recklessly send our boys off to undeclared wars for corporate interests while they sit safely at home, out of harms way.</p>
<p>Ron Paul is not one of those politicians. Unlike everyone else running for president, he actually served in the military; his track record is consistent; and he has tirelessly opposed the illegal, unjust wars that have cost the lives of so many of our brothers and sisters.</p>
<p><a href="http://cvrp2012.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/tatiana.jpg" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://cvrp2012.files.wordpress.com']);"><img title="tatiana" src="http://cvrp2012.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/tatiana.jpg?w=300&amp;h=300" alt="%Album Release Party" width="300" height="300" /></a>When I first came across Tatiana Moroz on YouTube, I was impressed with her Dylan covers as well as her original recordings, but that was all I knew of her. Later, I learned that she was an ardent supporter of the liberty movement, Dr. Paul, and the troops who support him. Given her background of covering Dylan, her support for our troops, and the lyrics in <em>Masters of War</em>, it seemed only natural to ask if she would be interested in doing a cover for CVRP, so I sent her an email. I don’t know what I expected to hear from Tatiana, but her response was almost instantaneous. She said that she loved the song, had been thinking about covering it for a while, and that she would be happy to fulfill our request. She was even kind enough to throw in a bonus recording of <em>Knockin’ on Heavens Door.</em></p>
<p>So, here it is, perhaps one of the most stirring, passionate renditions of this classic song out there, seemingly tailor-made for CVRP’s mission. Enjoy the songs and, when you’re finished, please let Tatiana know that we support her and her promotion of Ron Paul’s message of liberty and peace!</p>

<p><strong>“Masters Of War”</strong></p>
<p><strong>by Bob Dylan<a href="http://cvrp2012.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/o9qaf00z.jpg" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://cvrp2012.files.wordpress.com']);"><img title="O9QAF00Z" src="http://cvrp2012.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/o9qaf00z.jpg?w=640" alt="%Album Release Party"  /></a></strong></p>
<p>Come you masters of war<br />
You that build all the guns<br />
You that build the death planes<br />
You that build all the bombs<br />
You that hide behind walls<br />
You that hide behind desks<br />
I just want you to know<br />
I can see through your masks.</p>
<p>You that never done nothin’<br />
But build to destroy<br />
You play with my world<br />
Like it’s your little toy<br />
You put a gun in my hand<br />
And you hide from my eyes<br />
And you turn and run farther<br />
When the fast bullets fly.</p>
<p>Like Judas of old<br />
You lie and deceive<br />
A world war can be won<br />
You want me to believe<br />
But I see through your eyes<br />
And I see through your brain<br />
Like I see through the water<br />
That runs down my drain.</p>
<p>You fasten all the triggers<br />
For the others to fire<br />
Then you set back and watch<br />
When the death count gets higher<br />
You hide in your mansion’<br />
As young people’s blood<br />
Flows out of their bodies<br />
And is buried in the mud.</p>
<p>You’ve thrown the worst fear<br />
That can ever be hurled<br />
Fear to bring children<br />
Into the world<br />
For threatening my baby<br />
Unborn and unnamed<br />
You ain’t worth the blood<br />
That runs in your veins.</p>
<p>How much do I know<br />
To talk out of turn<br />
You might say that I’m young<br />
You might say I’m unlearned<br />
But there’s one thing I know<br />
Though I’m younger than you<br />
That even Jesus would never<br />
Forgive what you do.</p>
<p>Let me ask you one question<br />
Is your money that good<br />
Will it buy you forgiveness<br />
Do you think that it could<br />
I think you will find<br />
When your death takes its toll<br />
All the money you made<br />
Will never buy back your soul.</p>
<p>And I hope that you die<br />
And your death’ll come soon<br />
I will follow your casket<br />
In the pale afternoon<br />
And I’ll watch while you’re lowered<br />
Down to your deathbed<br />
And I’ll stand over your grave<br />
‘Til I’m sure that you’re dead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hope this newsletter finds you well!  Wow- 2012 is turning out to be a hell of a year!  I have been doing a lot of recording and have been putting up a lot on YouTube.  I hope you will check out my channel <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ForeverMoreTatiana" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);">www.Youtube.com/ForeverMoreTatiana</a> and see the video for “Make A YouTube Video” (my brand new song I am super proud of).  For now, there is just a pic up there, but working on a full video for it right now.  If you know me personally, or follow me on Twitter or Facebook, you will know that I have become very politically active.  This can be a little tricky as an artist.  I don’t want to lose anyone or bore anyone with my views.  However, I can only be who I am.  I have found a growing movement that I strongly believe in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ron Paul and his band of merry followers can often be misunderstood.  He doesn’t get adequate or fair media coverage.  In fact, the powers that be often times try to misconstrue his message to make him seem a number of things that he is not.  I have been privileged enough to meet him and hear him speak in person.  As you will find in my video I made to support the troops (who are his biggest contributors), I was very moved.  I felt that I was truly in the presence of a man who can serve as a hero in the tradition of our founding fathers.  He is also a man who has stood behind his convictions and upholds the Constitution with every vote he makes.  I hope you are not offended by my choice to participate in this so openly.  However, when I was growing up, I had a great interest in saving the world.  I would encourage you to at least support that aspect of me, even if you disagree with his positions.  How often do you see young people giving a damn about anything more than their video games or the Kardashians?  I spend a lot of time educating myself about economics, foreign policy, government and corporate corruption, and more.  I have nothing but love for mankind, and am just doing my best to use my voice to make an actual difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why my first “official” political song is about the internet.  We all must keep in mind that (for the most part) people we know want to change things for the better.  We also have an unprecedented moment in history.  One where we simply turn on our computers, link into the net, and can speak to people from every background all around the world.  This gift is to help us learn from each other.  We are all from the same cloth, and this wardrobe needs a little coordination.  We <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can</span> help one another to make things better.  My personal belief is that through the freedom and liberty Jefferson, Franklin, Jackson, and other great leaders spoke about, we can achieve our goal.  Check it out though, as the song says “Call up a friend, send a message.  Tweet it up or make a YouTube video.  Speak your mind.  With education, the knowledge will start to grow.  So make a YouTube video!”  It is up to all of us to take responsibility and take steps forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that spirit, I have been fortunate enough to meet so many wonderful new friends.  The Combat Veterans for Ron Paul  (cvrp2012.com) asked that I cover 2 more Dylan songs for them (I know, it seems like 90% of my covers are by my pal Bob).  I posted them on YouTube as well:  “Masters of War” and “Knockin on Heaven’s Door”.  My lovely and talented videographer friend Cynthia Stepien has agreed to help me with some video, and of course Will Hensley is a genius producer, musician, and engineer.  Their kindness and talent will help me bring you my best work.  I hope you check them out if you need video or audio for anything:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a few gigs coming up, most notably this month at the Fine Grind in Little Falls.  All the info can be found below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will also be releasing an EP from the summer I made with another great talent (Chris Conway).  I can’t wait to put that on ITunes, but you an preview some of it on my soon to be redone website <a href="http://www.tatianamoroz.com/" >www.TatianaMoroz.com</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you as always for your continued support and interest in what I am doing.  Again, I hope that my political persuasions do not turn you off.  That is not my intent.  I just want peace, love, and liberty!  Feel free to share anything here with whomever you like, I love making new friends and fans!  Oh- and happy Valentine&#8217;s Day <img src="http://tatianamoroz.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt="%Album Release Party" class="wp-smiley" title="%" /> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Love,</p>

<p>Hi Everyone out there in Youtube land.  My name is Tatiana Moroz and I am very excited to march on the White House with the troops on Presidents Day Monday Feb 20, 2012.  I hope you all know that Ron Paul is the number one choice of the US Airforce, US Army, and US Navy.  And I bet you all know that Mitt Romney and Pres. Obama get most of their money from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and the rest of the banking institutions that fleeced the American people.  But you may be wondering how I got involved in this march?  I know that these big muscles may indicate that I am in the military, but don’t be fooled.  I’m just a singer-songwriter and a strong supporter of Ron Paul.</p>
<p>So why should you attend this march?  Well, for many years now there has been lots of talk about supporting our troops.  We put the bumper stickers on our cars, we wrap the ribbons around the trees, and we wear America Rules T-shirts.  But what does it all mean?  When our nation was attacked on 9/11, I was working in NY.  I saw the destruction wreaked upon our mighty city.  Now, I did have severe reservations about going into Iraq.  I am a peace loving person, and I didn’t want to see all the available men shipped off halfway across the world to a country that didn’t even attack us.  I was a modern woman, and I didn’t like to see my sisters forced to wear burkas in the hot desert sun and get stoned to death for stepping out of their arranged marriages or for the sin of being raped.  Yeah, and I was a little freaked out taking the subway.  So I put my fears aside and I was proud of the unity my golden city and country displayed.  I was grateful to the brave men and women willing to fight to defend us and our freedoms.</p>
<p>As time went on though, it became apparent to everyone just what we had been led into.  We seemed to be doing more harm than good.  The reports of all the innocent people dying over there on both sides became too much to bear.  There was so much corruption and misspent money.  The worst was seeing the soldiers coming back with PTSD and much worse.  They were basically abandoned by our government.  I didn’t want to be represented that way by our “leaders”.</p>
<p>So I got more politically involved.  I started to call my congressman, senators, and educate myself.  I was a Dennis Kucinich supporter at first, but I certainly kept my eye on his good friend Ron Paul too.  I signed petitions, I posted stuff on Facebook, I tried to learn as much as I could.  But it all changed when I started to understand the economics behind it all with a movie called “The Money Masters”.  Somewhere around that point, I became a 100% supporter of Ron Paul.  I picked up the audiobook “Liberty Defined” and listened to it every day in the shower.  I pushed all my friends to check out “Freedom to Facism” and “Fiat Empire”.  I marched in Occupy on October 17, 2011, and while I was disappointed that there weren’t more “End the Fed” signs, it certainly moved me in a way that made me feel ALIVE and like we finally were DOING something.  In January, I woke up at 3am to drive up to New Hampshire with some friends from the Young Americans for Liberty club to knock on doors and spread the message.  We waved signs, saw Rand Paul speak, but I know what the most memorable moment was.  I will remember it til the day I die.  It was when I got to hear Ron Paul speak in person, and after squeezing myself through the throngs of reporters (who probably wouldn’t report much on him anyway), I got to shake his hand and tell him that he was my hero.</p>
<p>When you are in the presence of the truth, when you are witnessing a moment of greatness, and when you can see the love and goodness mankind is capable of? You know it.  It’s undeniable.  The feeling of unity and a just cause was palpable and unforgettable.  Within that structure, I found, what I believe to be a family.  A growing family of people from all walks of life, young, old, republican, democrat, Muslim, Christian, Jewish, black, white, orange, whatever.  We were all brought together in the spirit of liberty and freedom.  And you know what?  We already had that freedom guaranteed to us in our US Constitution.</p>
<p>So that brings me to February 20, 2012.   The truth is out, and the message cannot be stopped.  I will not sit idly by and let our elected officials send more of our nations children off to war.  I will not let our currency be destroyed by the Fed and the banking institutions while our gov’t keeps spending like a college kid with his first credit card.  I will not be brainwashed by the mainstream media.  I will participate in this march.  I hope that you will too.  And besides, who doesn’t love a man in uniform?  Please be there February 20, 2012.  The rally is at noon, and we march to the Washington Monument at 2pm.  There’s even after party featuring awesome music by Rebel Inc. Jordan Page, Golden State and my personal hero Aimee Allen.  That party’s gonna sell out though, so please be sure to buy your tickets right away.  The march is free though and we welcome as many of you as possible.  There is a link to all this information in the description of this video.  I better see you at that march!  If you can’t make it though, be sure to get educated, spread the message, and MAKE A YOUTUBE VIDEO!  Ron Paul 2012 is the choice of the troops, and I hope he is yours too!</p>

				<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am such a naughty artist for not keeping in touch sooner (I hope Santa isn’t going to be pissed)!  It has been AGES since I wrote a newsletter.  I hope you will forgive me, the world is spinning faster and faster it seems and I have been working like crazy to bring you great music and performances. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!  I am so happy for this season, I’m finally slowing down (at least a bit) and seeing my family and friends.  I did a lot of recording at my studio <a href="http://www.PremierStudiosNY.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.PremierStudiosNY.com']);">www.PremierStudiosNY.com</a> this year, and hope to use the holiday break to do some more J  Here is the latest news….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worked with <a href="http://www.wahproductions.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.wahproductions.com']);">Will Hensley</a> on <em>“News Report”</em> and <em>“Leaving Tomorrow” </em>as well as the holiday EP “<strong><em>For the New Year”.  </em></strong>I am particularly proud of that; I look at it as my “hopeful look forward in light of the apocalypse”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It features <em>“Auld Lang Syne”</em> (The New Years Song), <em>“A Home In The Meadow-Greensleeves”</em> medley, <em>“Lulajze Jezuniu”</em> (a polish lullaby for Jesus by Chopin), and an original song I wrote to comfort the lonely during the holidays:<em> “Lonely Christmas Spirit”</em>.  Anyone can get these songs to download for free if they sign up for my mailing list (clearly I am not a spammer considering my last one was wayyy too long ago L )  Please send them to <a href="http://www.TatianaMoroz.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.TatianaMoroz.com']);">www.TatianaMoroz.com</a>   As a bonus, I am including a free download of <em>“Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”</em> and my medley of <em>“Silver and Gold and Hallelujah”.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The artwork for this btw was by Cinthia Contreras.  She’s an excellent photographer from the DR, and I am happy to have her J  <a href="http://cinthiacontreras.com/photography/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://cinthiacontreras.com']);">www.CinthiaContreras.com</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chris Conway and I worked a bit on tweeking the final vocals and subsequent mix on “Leaving Tomorrow” too, but I am most excited about our summer’s work.  It’s another acoustic EP featuring the covers <em>“Heart of Gold”, “House of the Rising Sun”, “Don’t Think Twice It’s Alright”</em> as well as an original blues song <em>“Rita” </em>and more!  Look for it in January!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have some cool gigs in the city in January and February at Gizzi’s, Culture Fix, and at the Fine Grind in Little Falls (check the calendar for details). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess I should get going, but I wanted to say thank you for all your support this year and over all the years.  I am lucky to have so many kind friends, family, and fans that are so complimentary.  I especially appreciate those of you who spread the word.  It’s not easy being an indie musician, but when I see you sharing my posts and coming to my gigs, it really makes a difference.  I hope I am “famous” one day so I can throw a big party to say thanks.  I def can’t do it without your help!  In the meantime, I hope you enjoy the free songs for download!  Check me out online and say hi J  I wish you and yours the best for the holiday and a wonderful, exciting, and prosperous New Year!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Love,</p>
<p>Tatiana</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS- writing some freedom songs too, so keep an eye out for “Make a Youtube Video” and a reworking of Evoltion for the Ron Paul Revolution!</p>

				<p>Last night I slept in the canyon</p>
<p>Thought I’d raise my eyes to the sky to see</p>
<p>Hoping to ask the right questions</p>
<p>Lord let the answers rain down on me</p>
<p><strong>Cause I wanna feel </strong></p>
<p><strong>Your warm hands on me, my California</strong></p>
<p><strong>And I wanna buy</strong></p>
<p><strong>A one-way ticket away from home</strong></p>
<p><strong>And I’m gonna find</strong></p>
<p><strong>My way back to you my California</strong></p>
<p><strong>And see the waves upon your shores</strong></p>
<p><strong>And see the waves upon your shores</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Life can be hard in the city</p>
<p>Sometimes some solitude can bring some clarity</p>
<p>All of this locked up emotion</p>
<p>You know I gotta let it all out of me</p>
<p><strong>Cause I wanna feel</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your warm hands on me, my California</strong></p>
<p><strong>And I wanna buy</strong></p>
<p><strong>A one-way ticket away from home</strong></p>
<p><strong>And I’m gonna find</strong></p>
<p><strong>My way back to you my California</strong></p>
<p><strong>And see the waves upon your shores</strong></p>
<p><strong>And see the waves upon your shores</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><br />

				<p>I know I don’t love you but I can’t get you off of my mind</p>
<p>Always thinking of you, though I ain’t the cheating kind</p>
<p>I sleep in my lover’s arms, am bothered by thoughts of your bed</p>
<p>Tryin not to think about who takes my place there instead</p>
<p><em>But you’re no good </em></p>
<p><em>Heartbreaker</em></p>
<p><em>Your dreamy eyes should hold no weight with me</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Cause you’re bad news and I remember walkin this way before</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your attitude is that you always come first</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’ve played this game before and I’ve never even won a single hand</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why do I raise the stakes for the thoughts of another man?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>You’re nothing but trouble but I can’t help that it turns me on</p>
<p>And it only adds fuel to this fire baby knowing that it’s wrong</p>
<p>The heat of your breath against my neck makes me weak in the knees</p>
<p>If I allow myself to go, you won’t tell anyone please?</p>
