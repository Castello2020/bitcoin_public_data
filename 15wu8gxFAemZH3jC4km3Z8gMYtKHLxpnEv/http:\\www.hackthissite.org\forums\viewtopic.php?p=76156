This python base MD5 Decrypter tool I made is rather quick but cannot crack passwords with numbers or special chars.it can crack a 4 letter long password in 5 minutes, it generates its own rainbow table to use for decrypting.you easily modify it to decrypt SHA1 or SHA2.the maximum length for a password to be cracked is 8, then again you can modify the rainbow table generator.here is the code:Code: Select allimport hashlibimport sysimport stringimport timecrackfile = sys.argv[1] #read hash file#start of our rainbow table generator codedef rainbow(): x=1 for x in range(x): for i in range(52): a=string.letters[i+x] for i in range(52): b=string.letters[i+x] for i in range(52): c=string.letters[i+x] for i in range(52): d=string.letters[i+x] for i in range(52): e=string.letters[i+x] for i in range(52): f=string.letters[i+x] for i in range(52): g=string.letters[i+x] for i in range(52): h=string.letters[i+x] yield h+g+f+e+d+c+b+a yield h+g+f+e+d+c+b yield h+g+f+e+d+c yield h+g+f+e+d yield h+g+f+e yield h+g+f yield h+g yield h#end of our rainbow table generator codedef Crack(passwd,HPS,alreadycracked=''): with open(crackfile, "r") as f: for h4sh in f: h4sh = h4sh.translate(None, "\n") h4sh2 = hashlib.md5(passwd).hexdigest() if h4sh in h4sh2: if passwd in alreadycracked: pass else: print "[ "+str(time.clock())+" ] "+""+h4sh+" is: '"+passwd+"'" return passwd elapsed=time.clock() print "Guessed Hashes: "+str(HPS) print "Total time elapsed: "+str(elapsed) print "\033[3A"print "PyCracker - By Th3 M4d H4tt3r"cracked=''HPS=0for rain in rainbow(): HPS=HPS+1 if cracked: Crack(rain,HPS,cracked) else: cracked=Crack(rain,HPS)Hope you guys like it - Th3_M4d_H4tt3rhere are some test hashes you can use:e2fc714c4727ee9395f324cd2e7f331f900150983cd24fb0d6963f7d28e17f721a1dc91c907325c69271ddf0c944bc7201fd38eaba0338571d10d5b2d36dfa6chave fun -- Moved to Programming section of the forums. ~Cent -- Th3_M4d_H4tt3r	Experienced User

Great post, the title is a bit misleading. You don't decrypt md5, since it is a hash. You can run a dictionary, rainbow, or bruteforce attack on the hash.This seems to be a bruteforcer for md5?Also, I wouldn't say that it creates it's own rainbow table to use, because that's still like running a dictionary attack if it has to first convert to md5 and then compare, opposed to just comparing pre-configured md5 hash values.Also, to make it faster, program it in something like C. Python works great (and I have done similar in php) but using an interpreted language opposed to a compiled will make it much faster.
If you're not willing to learn, no one can help you. If you're determined to learn, no one can stop you.⠠⠵The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.I can explain it for you, but I can't understand it for you.

Although it uses a dictionary like attack, it does generate its own table for cracking although not a rainbow table, it still uses the same method It could use numbers in the attack though. I am now working on one that can crack passwords with numbersEDIT; the only problem is I don't know very much C or C++

Yeah, I just tweaked the code to allow stdin to grab the dictionary file instead of having it hard coded into a variable :pAnyways, I plan on posting these soon to explain each step of the way. Even converting dictionaries into rainbow tables.

Without numbers or special chars a 4 character password shouldn't take a full five minutes. That being said, it's a nice code, impressive for python and is more than I'm willing to do. Good job.

I wouldn't say it is powerful, but it is a nice contribution and can be used for a great learning experience.

Well, I would say it is quite powerful for what python can do; thats what I meant. Tip me if I helped you!BTC Address: 15wu8gxFAemZH3jC4km3Z8gMYtKHLxpnEv

Python can do anything any other language can do (although things closer to the metal become slightly more difficult). You can fairly easily write a debugger/disassembler in Python, you can write a video game, you can write an operating system (but that's a bit more tricky. You'd most likely have to write a byte-code converter until you can fully port Python itself, but I digress.). You can literally do anything you want in it.
Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning. -Rick Cook
