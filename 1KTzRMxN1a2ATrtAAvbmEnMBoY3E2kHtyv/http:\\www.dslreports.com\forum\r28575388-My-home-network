« Lab • New triple monitor setup » DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix My home network I've finally cleaned it up a bit, still need to get some proper length cables for a few things but you can't see that from the picAlso wish I could get a right angle power cable that went the other way (see the power cable on the far end, the connector is 180 degrees from the near one so if I used the same cable it'd be pointing up.) and the power cables are 14 gauge)--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Aug-20 9:48 am · ke4pymPremiumjoin:2004-07-24Charlotte, NCReviews:·VOIPO·ooma·Verizon Broadban..·Northland Cable ..·Time Warner Cable ke4pym I can't tell what orientation your power plugs are.

It is a very nice plug and the strain relief looks very professional once you've stuffed the cable into the plug. Not sure how comfortable you are with doing this kinda thing... Me, I'd whack the end off and put that new end on without much a second thought.But I'm not responsible if you burn your shiny rack-o-gear down. actions · 2013-Aug-20 3:50 pm · TomS_Git-r-donePremium,MVMjoin:2002-07-19London, UKkudos:5 TomS_ MVM reply to DarkLogix »www.stayonline.com/iec-c13-to-c1···rds.aspxCheap too.Dont worry so much about the gauge of cable in them, any C13/C14 cable should be able to handle 10A, and your router isnt going to be drawing anywhere near that amount anyway.actions · 2013-Aug-20 4:05 pm · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix Thanks, and they have 14awgI go for 14 partly for the overkill factor, and no one makes a 10awg one (mathematically there is some better efficiency but I don't think its measurable.)--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Aug-20 4:20 pm · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix reply to TomS_ one other thing it seems the source I was using for those cat7 cables has vanished, so I'll have to look into another source and/or just use cat6, though I like using STP cables.--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Aug-20 4:22 pm · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix reply to ke4pym said by ke4pym:If the ground pin is on what would be the left side of that socket (from this viewpoint) then that plug you found would have the cable headed to the celing.

You might be able to get a cable management bar and install it backwards if it clears the rear of the unit. It would give you something secure to bind the cables to so they don't get yanked out if they drag on the new server below.actions · 2013-Aug-29 10:19 pm · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix I'd have to measure but I'd guess about 3inchesI found if I hold the cables while sliding the server its ok, just gotta be carefulI think I'll likely replace the cables with cables togo KVM cables in time--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Aug-30 9:13 am · Forums → Tech / Special Interest → Home/Office setup photos« Lab • New triple monitor setup »
