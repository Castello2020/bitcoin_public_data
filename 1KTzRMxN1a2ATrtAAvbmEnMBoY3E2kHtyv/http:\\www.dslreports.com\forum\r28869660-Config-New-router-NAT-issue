From my computer I can ping a loopback I put on the router (to confirm that I was getting through the router) also I can ping 4.2.2.2 from the routerbut I can't ping 4.2.2.2 or even the Comcast SMC from my computerand the sh nat t looks backwards--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Dec-8 11:26 am · HELLFIREPremiumjoin:2009-11-25kudos:15 HELLFIRE What's "show ip nat trans" show anyways, just as a question?Can't see anything obviously wrong with the config...

Or did you try to incorporate other changes in to it at the same time (excluding necessary changes like renaming interfaces)?Also you should probably fix your config register before the next power outage.actions · 2013-Dec-8 12:15 pm · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix Strait copy from the other router (just changed from GI2/0 for wan to gi 0/0 (as the 3745 had 2 FE onboard so it had a NM-1GE in slot 2 and that's not needed on the 3845)same IOS version though 124 25dI'll get the config, was just trying some stuff (thought maybe NVI might work on the 3845 but um no change and on issuing "no ip nat source list 1 pool RLH1 overload" then typing yes it crashedso I'm going to stick with in/out nat instead of nvi--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Dec-8 12:23 pm · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix ok arrg not going to try NVI till I can get a newer IOSwould c3845-adventerprisek9-mz.124-24.T.bin be worth trying?looks like I'm going to have to delete the start reload and put in the config again because issuing "no ip nat source list 1 pool RLH1 overload" then typing yes causes a router crash--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Dec-8 12:27 pm · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix reply to TomS_ said by TomS_:Also you should probably fix your config register before the next power outage.ya I noticed that and fixed it, though now I've unfixed it and will refix it--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Dec-8 12:32 pm · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:31 edit DarkLogix reply to DarkLogixhere is the full config from the 3745 that I'm adapting to the 3845 (should only be minor things like GI 2/0 to GI 0/0)

Its a very simple "does NAT work" test that I use all the time.Also you left one of your IPs in the tunnel interface config. :-PTo be a pain, can you post a translated config, rather than one littered with comments about what youre going to do?actions · 2013-Dec-8 12:54 pm · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix even though the router's own interfaces are denied via ACL to nat?the allowed nets are 10.0.2.x .3.x .4.x but not 10.255.255.x--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Dec-8 12:56 pm · TomS_Git-r-donePremium,MVMjoin:2002-07-19London, UKkudos:5 TomS_ MVM Well obviously in a case like that it wont. But as long as the IP being sourced from is NATable, then yes it would work.e.g. from my parents place:interface BVI1

actions · 2013-Dec-8 1:02 pm · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix as you can see from the config the router only has pblic and 10.255.255.x addresses, the etherswitches then do the vlan routing to connect the 10.0.2.x ect nets.--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Dec-8 1:04 pm · TomS_Git-r-donePremium,MVMjoin:2002-07-19London, UKkudos:5 TomS_ MVM reply to DarkLogix I'd try a 15.1 image if you can get your hands on it.The 877W at my parents is running 15.1 just fine with a traditional NAT config.A friend with a 3825 is also running a traditional NAT config just fine with 15.1.actions · 2013-Dec-8 1:04 pm · TomS_Git-r-donePremium,MVMjoin:2002-07-19London, UKkudos:5 TomS_ MVM reply to DarkLogix Right. So add a simple rule to allow the subnets used between the router and etherswitches. Its worth it for troubleshooting, even if you just take it out afterwards.But probably also worth leaving in for troubleshooting out from an etherswitch. Probably no real reason why everything on your network should be allowed out, but you deny those couple of subnets. They are the devices least likely to cause issues. :Pactions · 2013-Dec-8 1:06 pm · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix here's a copy of "sh ip nat t"Pro Inside global      Inside local       Outside local      Outside global
