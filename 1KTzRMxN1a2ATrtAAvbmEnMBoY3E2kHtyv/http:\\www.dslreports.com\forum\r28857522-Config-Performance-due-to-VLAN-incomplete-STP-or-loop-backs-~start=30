The customer was famous (or rather infamous) of jumping from one consultant to another. The problem was that the customer did not seem to understand what exactly they looked for and never provided clear requirement. Even when you did get a requirement and you provided your best suggestions in return, the customer did not take the suggestion due to the fact that you were just consultant and not an employee.It was definitely unique customer attitude to work with Arrg I get users like that alot, they say what they think they want but they don't really know.like a user asking for a big external harddrive because their H drive is full, its only as full as the quota I set shows and I can make it bigger in a few seconds without buying anything.(that's just one example I've had many more issues like that)Normally I push them to say what they want to do or what the real problem is--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Dec-4 1:21 pm · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix reply to tubbynet said by tubbynet:you assume that you're not designing a wan architecture based on dmvpn-esque architecture.well at the place I was at before they had a warehouse that was maybe 5-6 people but still spent the money (before me) for a fractional T1 MPLSthough they didn't have DHCP service, oh what a pain it was dealing with that site till I got my bearings (statics every enduser) did a simple ip helper on their router and bam DHCP.--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Dec-4 1:25 pm · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix reply to tubbynet said by tubbynet:said by DarkLogix:I suggest hardware only because its the only way to achieve a real core with proper links.better tell that to *every* service provider out there that has built out a *huge* metro access topology using fiber rings.q.Fiddi is different.--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Dec-4 1:26 pm · tubbynetreminds me of the danse russePremium,MVMjoin:2008-01-16Chandler, AZkudos:1 tubbynet MVM said by DarkLogix:Fiddi is different.swing and a miss.this isn't fddi. sp's haven't used fddi in 10 years.i'm talking about pure ethernet metro access. with things like cisco's rep using 1588 synch-e and mpls-te and frr -- i can achieve near sonet convergence time (i.e. a protect circuit is 50ms) over ethernet protocols. oh yeah -- and i'm doing it over rings.q.--"...if I in my north room dance naked, grotesquely before my mirror waving my shirt round my head and singing softly to myself..."actions · 2013-Dec-4 1:29 pm · Nsane_icemanPremiumjoin:2001-02-26North Richland Hills, TX Nsane_iceman reply to HELLFIREsaid by HELLFIRE:Another immediate thought... what does "show processor cpu history" "show processor mem" and "show log"on each device show?

Methinks you may want to redo your diagram WITH the interface-to-link status AND an addressing schemeas well.Regardsactions · 2013-Dec-5 3:17 am · Da Geek Kidjoin:2003-10-11::1kudos:1Reviews:·Callcentric Da Geek Kid switch 6 has one vlan and it's not considered a core, but rather L2 switch. Another Major issue that was mentioned is that the core switches 1 and 2 do not have the same IOS which will break the network if configured improperly... In this situation, since there are no routing protocols running on either switch, it should be ok.

The way cramer put it is about the size of it -- distributed management "in the cloud" with limited or remote-based IT resources.They didn't state so specifically, but pretty sure so long as your WAN link is up, "the cloud" gives you(r NOC)remote management capabilities without relying on onsite / inperson / truckroll support. And as cramer points out at this level where Meraki's targetted for, persistent OOB or backup WAN access isn't likely to bean expense or set up for.Just for chuckles, I browsed through the Cisco Meraki product listing :- cheapest security device has 5GbE / 100Mbps thruput / WAN Opt / layer 7 firewall / traffic analysis for $495 -- I'dlike to see ASA550X do the last 3 points for that price.- switches start from 8port GbE for $985 -- IIRC, cheapest IOS all-Gig switch is a 2960S which at retail isaround $10K. Layer 3 switches price-wise start at $5305, while a 3560 AdvIPServices is around twice that, IIRC.- the "cloud management" is all web based, and looks pretty easy to navigate -- but coming from an IOS / CLIbackground, it kinda hurt to see a pane set up SPECIFICALLY for ping / traceroute / remote access / throughputtest, etc. But for a remote NOC / limited IT support, I could see this working.Not to sound like an advertisement for Meraki, but just my initial impressions.@OPLet us know if you are able to share more details about your network as I'd requested or not.Regardsactions · 2013-Dec-8 11:38 am · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix um you can get a 2960s for $1,796»www.provantage.com/cisco-systems···O33M.htmwhere do you get the cheapest gig IOS is $10k?--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Dec-8 11:48 am · HELLFIREPremiumjoin:2009-11-25kudos:15 HELLFIRE ...I recalled incorrectly, then Regardsactions · 2013-Dec-8 12:00 pm · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix you can get a loaded 3750x for $13k (IE UPOE, 48port, IPadv)ya if it were 10k for a 2960s now then when I bought my 2960g it would have been much more than the just under a grand I paid (its 20 port gig plus 4 combo ports, though for me it might as well be 24 port gig as I don't plan to get any SFP's)--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Dec-8 12:02 pm · HELLFIREPremiumjoin:2009-11-25kudos:15 HELLFIRE Yeah, but within the scope of the market that Meraki's targetting, do you see a schoolboard or "national retail chain"more likely going for a Meraki L3 switch or a 3750X?

Second, I am not sure if I stated this clearly but 2960S switch is an utter Mule Dung! If I see it anywhere with any type of issues, I'd pull it and replace it with Netgear or anything else worth 50cents because that would be an upgrade. There's just not enough forum posts that I can express the trashness of this utter device. I could only refer to the IOS version upgrades that you can check which get released, sometimes, weekly.there's no way to compare a Cat6 with any other Cisco switch. The Cat 3750X which has been my Fav chassisless switches now have been replaced my most fav. 3850... 3850's are what I wanted from Cisco about 15/20 years ago but now they are here. They are capable of Mobility Controller as well as Netflow with Stack power and IOS XE which are the same as the ASRs... The new Cat4K Sups also come with it.actions · 2013-Dec-8 1:47 pm · TomS_Git-r-donePremium,MVMjoin:2002-07-19London, UKkudos:5 TomS_ MVM reply to tubbynet omg you said synergy actions · 2013-Dec-8 1:51 pm · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix reply to Da Geek Kid said by Da Geek Kid:2960S switch is an utter Mule Dung!on that note, if I had the authority then due to the craptaculerness of juniper I'd toss every juniper I see into the nearest trash canI just can't express how very bad any juniper device is.--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Dec-8 1:58 pm · tubbynetreminds me of the danse russePremium,MVMjoin:2008-01-16Chandler, AZkudos:1 tubbynet MVM reply to TomS_ said by TomS_:omg you said synergy i've been working with our sales teams way too much.i need to do 50 "conf t's" in apology.q.--"...if I in my north room dance naked, grotesquely before my mirror waving my shirt round my head and singing softly to myself..."actions · 2013-Dec-8 3:16 pm · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix said by tubbynet:said by TomS_:omg you said synergy i've been working with our sales teams way too much.i need to do 50 "conf t's" in apology.q.you must seek absolutionso help me with my nat issue on my new router.--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Dec-8 3:20 pm · tubbynetreminds me of the danse russePremium,MVMjoin:2008-01-16Chandler, AZkudos:1 tubbynet MVM said by DarkLogix:so help me with my nat issue on my new router.thats not how it works, sparkplug.q.actions · 2013-Dec-8 4:48 pm · TomS_Git-r-donePremium,MVMjoin:2002-07-19London, UKkudos:5 TomS_ MVM reply to DarkLogix said by DarkLogix:I just can't express how very bad any juniper device is.Until you can, quit giving them a bad wrap.If you cant elaborate, clearly theres not much wrong.actions · 2013-Dec-9 6:45 am · Forums → Equipment Support → Hardware By Brand → Cisco« [Config] VPN Cisco 2620xm router cannot see local lan • [HELP] Will this traffic be NATted? »prev page · 1 · 2 · 3 · 4 · 5 · 6 · nextMost commented news this week[106] Verizon: Our Review Shows No Congestion; Netflix to Blame[95] Wall Street Whines About New 10 Mbps Min.
