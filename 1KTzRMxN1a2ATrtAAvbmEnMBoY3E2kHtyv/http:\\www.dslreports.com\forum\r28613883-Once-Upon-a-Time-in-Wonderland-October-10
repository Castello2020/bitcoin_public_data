And I thought the visuals were well-done.actions · 2013-Oct-11 10:45 am · Alpha PhoenixPremiumjoin:2001-06-15Brooklyn, NY Alpha Phoenix reply to darcilicious There's something that's been bothering me this whole time. In Once Upon a Time (OPaT), Cora was banished through the looking glass by Regina, and ended up becoming The Queen of Hearts in Wonderland. But in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland ("Wonderland"), it's Anastasia who is The Red Queen. And considering that is is a spin-off series from OPaT, and takes a lot of influence from the original series, this is not dovetailing properly with what was depicted in OPaT, unless The Red Queen and The Queen of Hearts or two completely different Queens, both who love red? And if that's the case, what's the difference between the two of them?Edit: I just looked it up and it appears they are two completely different Queens, both of whom seem to love red (which further added to my confusion). So what's the difference between the two of them, and how come we haven't seen The Red Queen (Anastasia), and The Queen of Hearts (Cora) having crossed paths and clashed in Wonderland?--"I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use." - Galileoactions · 2013-Dec-19 4:05 am · darciliciousCyber LibrarianPremiumjoin:2001-01-02Forest Grove, ORkudos:4Reviews:·Frontier FiOS darcilicious Could be happening / have happened at completely different times.In any case, it's not something that I have worried about or even given much thought (though I never thought they were the same queens). I mean for that matter, we haven't seen the Mad Hatter either.--♬ Dragon of good fortune struggles with the trickster Fox ♬actions · 2013-Dec-19 9:42 am · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix said by darcilicious:we haven't seen the Mad Hatter either.They said he wasn't in wonderland.We know where he is.--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Dec-19 10:25 am · TwiztedZeroNine Zero Burp Nine SixPremiumjoin:2011-03-31Toronto, ONkudos:5 TwiztedZero reply to darcilicious Also noted that in Toronto, Once Upon a Time is on CTV While Once Upon a Time in Wonderland is on City (formerly CityTV). I was kind of puzzled myself at first at this oddness.

I was kind of puzzled myself at first at this oddness. I kinda think I still am, because both are produced by ABC it appears.Yep! It confused both my friend and I who watch both on a (somewhat) regular basis. It's a bit funny because on other forums Americans frequently complain about spoiler threads from Canadians since (at least) the main series is aired here earlier than the U.S. which confuses a lot of people.If people are still wondering, it's the Queen of Hearts (Cora) who came into power first and then later on the Red Queen (Anatasia). We know this since the Mad Hatter came during Cora's reign; if it were the other way around there would be no Mad Hatter's place and Alice wouldn't have entered a house full of hats where she would later find Cyrus' amulet outside.actions · 2013-Dec-21 4:09 am · TwiztedZeroNine Zero Burp Nine SixPremiumjoin:2011-03-31Toronto, ONkudos:5 TwiztedZero Both shows, different universes.

Thats the only way to approach it. There isn't any cross overs. Its intentional.Actually, it's the same universe. Wonderland is a direct spin-off from Once Upon a Time. And The Caterpillar right off the bat is the most obvious crossover. Same exact character, same exact look.--"I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use." - Galileoactions · 2013-Dec-21 8:26 pm · Zoderjoin:2002-04-16Miami, FL Zoder reply to darcilicious When they show Alice in the real world, it's pretty obvious to me it's taking place during Victorian times. Horse drawn carriages and the asylum being two examples. So wouldn't that make it a prequel?actions · 2013-Dec-21 8:34 pm · Alpha PhoenixPremiumjoin:2001-06-15Brooklyn, NY Alpha Phoenix You're assuming the portal only travels through dimensions? Time is relative in magical realms, and the world where Alice existed in the real world might just be a different "real world", else how would you explain the same exact Caterpillar in both series, and The Mad Hatter's house in Wonderland when he clearly didn't get trapped there until Once Upon a Time?--"I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use." - Galileoactions · 2013-Dec-21 8:57 pm · SixOfNineBrake In A Ladylike Manner.Premiumjoin:2001-08-30Sterling, VA1 recommendation SixOfNine reply to darcilicious In fact, the second scene (or close to it) of the series features the Knave in Storybrooke.--Leave the gun.
