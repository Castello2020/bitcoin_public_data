The only time I've seriously advocated going in and replacing hubs is in a large structured network, a network with security concerns, or a network that runs cloud/SaaS/thin-client services. Most home networks won't be adversely affected unless there are a ton of file transfers. actions · 2014-Jan-2 6:43 pm · TomS_Git-r-donePremium,MVMjoin:2002-07-19London, UKkudos:5 TomS_ MVM reply to stevephl A lot of people still refer to switches as hubs. Force of habit.Someone I used to work with, who had been working in the computer industry for decades before I even got on the Internet for the first time still referred to speeds in baud. 100 megabaud hed say, referring to what we know as 100 megabit.actions · 2014-Jan-5 7:54 am · TomS_Git-r-donePremium,MVMjoin:2002-07-19London, UKkudos:51 recommendation TomS_ MVM reply to sk1939 With the amount of media devices and storage this guy seems to have on his network, a hub would likely be a serious performance constraint.Assuming it is indeed a hub, and not a switch that hes calling a hub as per above of course.actions · 2014-Jan-5 7:56 am · Kronos9326join:2004-07-31Mississauga, ON Kronos9326 reply to Kronos9326 My bad, the white box just above the monitor in one of the images is indeed an unmanaged switch.I do have on order another switch which will be going in my 'media room'.actions · 2014-Jan-5 3:47 pm · stevephljoin:2000-11-27Colorado Springs, CO stevephl reply to TomS_ Your probably correct, I remember a manufacturing plant I worked in we had nothing but hubs in the mid 90's.
