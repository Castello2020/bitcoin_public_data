You have to take ownership first, close out of the security properties, then go back in to change permissions.However as its a user's profile folder you need to reboot and login as a different user first, as the folder will be locked once the user logged in.I once ran into something similar on an exch server, the C drive had gotten full and part of the other person's clean up to get enough space to fix the cause they managed to force some odd stuff on my admin profile, I had to wait months for the server to be rebooted before I could loggin at all to the server.--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Nov-18 1:35 pm · KilroyPremium,MVMjoin:2002-11-21Saint Paul, MN Kilroy MVM reply to Camelot One I thought I took ownership of it previously, but I didn't get the pop up to apply to all items.I also ran an SFC /SCANNOW prior to the registry import below and some issues were found and corrected.I exported these two registry keys, mentioned in this post.HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FolderDescriptionsHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\explorer\FolderDescriptionsfrom my machine. Then imported into the problem machine. Then I was able to take ownership, with the pop up to apply to all items, and finally I was able to rename the folder.The issue should be resolved, once I can have the user log back in.--"Progress isn't made by early risers.
