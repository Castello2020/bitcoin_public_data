Did you take any in situ? I'm interested in the condition of the insulation over the conductors that were connected to this outlet. Since you've had more than one fail, do you have any intention of inspecting the rest of them (assuming this is your home and you own it). actions · 2013-Oct-7 11:59 am · Bamafan2277join:2008-09-20Jeffersonville, IN Bamafan2277 reply to DarkLogix Probably worth the time and little money investment to go through the house and change them all out before one fails worse than that.actions · 2013-Oct-7 11:59 am · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix reply to pike Well I had an electrician replace it as I had to go to work Saturday .this is the last of 4 that were in my bed room.And well the house is being sold next summer so...So at 2:30am (just got home heated up some food turned on my computer and was going to eat then get on the computer a little before getting some sleep, I smelled some electrical burning smell looked around and didn't see anything (the outlet isn't exactly visible due to stuff in front) then I heard a load pop sound and looked at the outlet because that was the general location of the sound, and pointed a flashlight and saw smoke.then I heard another pop and the power went out, I hit the power buttons on my UPS's and went outside to the breaker panel to turn off the breaker if it wasn't tripped already, well it was.--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Oct-7 12:42 pm · iknow_tjoin:2012-05-03 iknow_t reply to DarkLogix if you go to put a plug in an outlet, and it feels loose, this can happen. any loose outlets need to be changed immediately, they wear out, and give you a high resistance connection. backstab or not.actions · 2013-Oct-7 1:54 pm · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix the outlet was tight 5+ years ago when I plugged the single outlet surge suppressor in and screwed it down.I'll get a pic of the directly connected device tonight--semper idem1KTzRMxN1a2ATrtAAvbmEnMBoY3E2kHtyvactions · 2013-Oct-7 2:18 pm · Jack_in_VAPremiumjoin:2007-11-26North, VAkudos:1Reviews:·Millenicom Jack_in_VA reply to DarkLogix Receptacle Tension TesterThis Receptacle Tension Tester by Woodhead ensures there is proper tension on all your outlets.It might not be the back stab connection but lost tension on the male plug by the receptacle plug. actions · 2013-Oct-7 5:14 pm · garys_2kPremiumjoin:2004-05-07Farmington, MI garys_2k Yeah, the fact that the scorching looks like it came out the front of the outlet does appear that the prong wasn't held tightly enough.actions · 2013-Oct-7 5:18 pm · smoked@myvzw.comsmoked reply to DarkLogix The contacts in those resi-grade receptacles are complete crap. Even when new many will barely hold a plug tightly. With some age, even a light load will cause heating and what little contact tension exists goes out the window ultimately causing meltdown or worse. Good thing this circuit wasn't protected by an FPE breaker or you'd probably be posting from a hotel room.actions · 2013-Oct-7 7:00 pm · robbinPremium,MVMjoin:2000-09-21Leander, TXkudos:1 robbin MVM reply to DarkLogix You should carefully check the plug that was plugged into the outlet as the prongs on it may be also damaged or at least need to be cleaned.actions · 2013-Oct-7 7:04 pm · linicxCaveat EmptorPremiumjoin:2002-12-03United StateReviews:·TracFone Wireless·CenturyLink linicx reply to DarkLogix Don't fool with it, fix it. When you sell is moot. Safety today is the first and only project as it is a fire issue.I bought an older home and discovered there was far more to r/r that I an anticipated. The first thing on the list was to install a larger electric panel and replace every wall socket and light switch in the house. The second was to add lighting where there was none. I've since replaced a couple of switches and three outlets that were new. They arced when I used them. I could hear a soft 'pop'. Of the outlets, one was not holding the plug securely. It was causing a breaker to fail.Good luck to you.--Mac: No windows, No Gates, Apple insideactions · 2013-Oct-7 8:02 pm · DarkLogixTexan and ProudPremiumjoin:2008-10-23Baytown, TXkudos:3 DarkLogix Here's a pic of what was plugged inNot plugged in now.

The neutral or hot pops out the back.And lucky it doesn't short n the back.But this looks nothing like the backstab failures I had.Hindsight for me was using the outlet tester and the initial push pull caused the failure of the backstab to pop out inside the outlet. Lost neutral on line.From then on, I replaced all my outlets and secured side screw in, with white tape wrap over all ('cept ground).--Splatactions · 2013-Oct-8 3:53 pm · SmokChsrWho let the magic smoke out?Premiumjoin:2006-03-17Saint Augustine, FL SmokChsr reply to DarkLogix From the pictures, it look more like a neutral tension problem, but that's not conclusive with out a better examination.I generally trust Leviton, but they too have troubles. When an addition was put on my house in the early to mid 70's they used Leviton outlets and 100% of them failed in 10 years due to poor contact tension. (well after the 4th one gave up the ghost I checked and replaced the rest all were not good) Their new product is back to trustworthy, I hope. actions · 2013-Oct-9 3:48 am · speedypeteyjoin:2011-12-10 speedypetey said by SmokChsr:From the pictures, it look more like a neutral tension problem, but that's not conclusive with out a better examination.This!!It was NOT a paper clip (lol), not a bad back-stab, and it was not the device plugged in.Older receptacles, especially resi-grade ones, that get used a lot tend to lose tension in at the prongs.
