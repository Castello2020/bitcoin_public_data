How long has lead paint been out of the market place?<br></p></div>There is a lead paint form you must sign that's mandated by law if the property was built in or before 1978 before you can close. You don't have to have lead testing but you have to sign that you know there could be lead in the property. If the seller has ever tested they have to disclose the results. I doubt it's a huge thing in Ohio but in New England it's very common to have lead paint somewhere. ]]></description>

He was a heavy smoker. What is the best way to clean the walls, cabinets, etc... </p></div>If you want to do this on the cheap take a page from motels. Throw out the curtains. Wash the walls with something like vinegar and hot water. When dry, paint using 2 ounces of pure vanilla extract to every gallon of paint. The smoke smell is gone! It is how they convert the smoking rooms to non-smoking. <br><br>Clean linoleum, faucets, sinks and counters with hot water and vinegar. Last call a company like Service Master. They cleaned the Pentagon after 9/11 and  have carpets cleaned. If they are not worth cleaning remove it, mop the subfloors with vinegar and water and then install new carpet. What vinegar does is loosen dirt so you can get rid of it.  1/2  C vinegar per every 1 gallons of water is a good mix. Use 3/4 C for extra dirty surface. <br><br>You can use paper towels or go to the auto parts store and buy a package of shop towels for $7. They're tough, washable, and often lint free and streak free. If they are dirty they usually wash pretty good with a dab of soap, scrub it between your hands and be sure to rinse all the soap out. Let it dry. My natural shampoo strips oil from hair and also my dish cloths. I bought and clean houses for 30 years. It works pretty good most of the time. <br><br>Be cautious of plaster walls. Too wet is a recipe for disaster. <br><small>--<br>Mac: No windows, No Gates, Apple inside</small>]]></description>

It was so bad after going through with the Realtor my nose burned all night! I was expecting to have to deal with the smoke smell forever.  We washed the walls / doors / cabinets with TSP. Then painted all surfaces with 2 coats of Killz.  Shampooed the carpet. I thought we'd never get rid of the smell completely, but it was gone in a couple days.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[PX Eliezer posted : Sorry for your loss.<br><br>-----<br><br>It sounds like the cost could be thousands of dollars (carpets, appliances, painting, etc).<br><br>I wonder if there is a local custom in your area where the house could be sold to another smoker.  In that event the cleanup might be a little less costly, and the house could be priced proportionately lower.<br><br>I know that sounds silly, but you could ask the real estate broker if such a thing can be done.

<description><![CDATA[Mango posted : To help with the smell, you may want to consider an ozone generator.  I know someone who got a great deal on a used car that was formerly driven by a smoker.  He rented an ozone generator, and four hours later you couldn't tell the difference.  I've used one for other stubborn odors (large volume of animal excrement left in house by former tenant...don't ask) and it worked a treat. <br><br>Be sure to get a generator that is sized appropriately for the house.  Using a cheap low-powered generator for a long time will not work as well as a powerful generator for a short time because the ozone quickly converts back into oxygen.  If the house has lots of doors, you can use the generator in one room at a time.<br><br>It cost me about $100 to rent mine and was worth every penny.  The machines can be harmful if used improperly, so be sure to follow the directions.  As long as no people, plants, or pets are in the house while it's operating and for the prescribed amount of time after the machine shuts off, you should be fine.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[jrs8084 posted : Obviously, the sky is the limit on how much you wish to spend on smoke remediation. I used to smoke-I know how it destroys a house.<br><br>If you are simply trying to clean this up a bit, a good wash with clear ammonia/water mix works wonders. You can add a small amount of a surfactant of your choice (i.e. lemon cleaner, pine cleaner) to help if their are additional soils. But, you will be changing the water often no matter what you do. I don't like sudsy washes for walls. You could also use lemon ammonia. This will knock down a vast majority of the tar in your first pass.<br><br>The ammonia won't work so well in the kitchen if their are grease buildups. a butyl based cleaner such as Mean Green or Greased Lightening will emulsify the grease and smoke.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[dandelion posted : I found the business were a little steep. I think it depends on what you wish to do with the house. Getting it totally smoke free will be very hard/impossible but you can get it close. <br><br>Take all carpets up, throw away things that can't be cleaned of smoke i.e. most books, magazines, pillows. Some hard to replace items MAY benefit from repeated washing and/or dry cleaning. Washing walls and ceilings then re-paint, pulling off wallpaper and washing all wood/furniture with Murphy's oil soap. <br><br>Attempting this myself, I also got the vents cleaned by professionals and of course basic things like changing furnace filters. A lot of furniture/mattresses also needed replacing if upholstered items.

<description><![CDATA[dark_star posted : I used to have an apartment painting business. Occasionally, I had the misfortune of painting the apartment of a longtime resident who had been a heavy smoker.<br><br>Hot water on a rag / paper towels works well to get most of the tar off of smooth non-porous surfaces such as walls and cabinets. Plan to use a case or two of paper towels.<br><br>Wear rubber gloves since nicotine can be absorbed through the skin.<br><br>You can speed things up on the walls by using a sponge mop, the common kind meant for floors. Don't soak the walls, if you do you will damage the dry wall. Wring the mop out first. Change the mop bucket water frequently, and don't forget to use hot water.<br><br>The walls will still need to be painted. But washing them down means you may get away with as little as two coats, if you use a top quality paint and apply it generously.<br><br>The ceilings aren't practical to clean. You'll have to prime and paint them multiple times. Let dry overnight between coats.<br><br>Carpets will need to be replaced. Ducts will need to be cleaned. Replace the furnace / air conditioner filters.  <br><br>Ideally, replace all appliances. If you can't do that, be sure to clean the dust off of the refrigerator coils.]]></description>
