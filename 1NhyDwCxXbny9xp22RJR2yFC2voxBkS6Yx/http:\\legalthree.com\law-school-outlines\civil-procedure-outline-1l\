<ol>
<li>Selecting a proper<br />
court</p>
<ul>
<li>In choosing a court<br />
you must first determine:</p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>Personal<br />
Jurisdiction</strong></em>: Jurisdiction over the parties, check for<br />
<em>minimum contacts</em> with the forum state (<strong>Fed OR State<br />
Ct</strong>) AND the party must then receive <em>proper notice </em><em><strong>due<br />
process.</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>Venue</strong></em>:<br />
The case must be heard in any dist where the D resides OR where<br />
a substantial portion of the events occurred. (In Fed Ct this<br />
is one of the 13 districts)</li>
<li><em><strong>Subject Matter<br />
Jurisdiction</strong></em>: FEDERAL ONLY (because states have<br />
universal jurisdiction over any occurrence within the forum)</p>
<ul>
<li>Diversity: No P is<br />
of the same state as any D &#8211; AND $75,000.01 ($75K alone is not<br />
enough)</li>
<li>Federal Question:<br />
Question the US Constitution, Fed treaty, or act of Congress<br />
(No min $ for fed Question)</li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Class<br />

<ol>
<li><strong>General Jurisdiction</strong>
<ol type="i">
<li>Jurisdiction over the D<br />
irrespective of the nature of the claim</li>
<li>Claims where the suit is<br />
unrelated to activity in the forum</li>
<li>Continuous systematic<br />
activities (Int Shoe)</li>
</ol>

<li>Jurisdiction because the<br />
D activities in the state are the subject of the suit</li>
<li>Minimum contacts or<br />
purposeful availment required</li>

<li><strong>Personal<br />
Jurisdiction: </strong></p>
<ol type="i">
<li>US<br />
Constitution Amendment XIV, Section 1</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ul>
<li>All persons born and<br />
naturalized in the United States   subject to the jurisdiction,<br />
are citizens of the US in the state they reside. They shall not<br />
be deprived of life liberty or property <em>without due process<br />
of law</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Due<br />
Process: “The protection and enforcement of private rights,<br />
including <strong>notice </strong>and the right to a <strong>fair hearing</strong><br />
before a tribunal with the power to decide the case.” &#8211; Black&#8217;s</p>
<ul>
<li>Proceedings in a court<br />
to determine personal rights and obligations of parties over<br />
whom the ct has no jurisdiction do not constitute due process of<br />
law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Pennoyer<br />
v. Neff </strong>pg 71-82</p>
<ol>
<li>Jurisdiction over a<br />
person is valid by their <strong>presence within the forum state.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Territoriality<br />
Rule” &#8211; Every state has power over persons and property<br />
located within the state and may assert power of  any D resident<br />
or not, by personally serving him summons while he is present in<br />
the forum state, even if only there briefly. (Exception for<br />
Special Appearance to contest Jurisdiction)</p>
<ol>
<li>A state CANNOT obtain<br />
personal jurisdiction by serving process outside the state on a<br />
non-resident D</li>
<li>A state CAN establish<br />
<strong>in</strong> <strong>rem OR</strong> <strong>quasi in rem</strong> if the D owns<br />
property in the forum state AND the property is legally<br />
attached (put a sign on the property) giving constructive<br />
notice that legal action is pending.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>US<br />
Supreme HELD that improper assertion of PJ violates a D rights<br />
to due process under XIV any judgment in violation of due<br />
process is invalid and unenforceable</li>
<li><strong>RULE</strong> A court<br />
may enter judgement against a non-resident only if the D is 1<br />
served personally while in the forum state OR 2 has property<br />
within the state that is attached BEFORE litigation establishing<br />
quasi in rem jurisdiction</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Three<br />
Types of Personal Jurisdiction.</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>In Personum –<br />
</strong>Personal Jurisdiction over the person who must be served with<br />
due process. Judgment is not limited and can be enforced in any<br />
state. Since Pennoyer and still today, if you are present in the<br />
state you can be sued about anything, even if it has nothing to<br />
do with the state, as long as you are in the state the Ct has In<br />
Personum over you. (However if the Ct will follow the <em>substantive</em><br />
law of the state the incident occurred in if suit in CA was about<br />
injury in FL then CA court will use FL law for <em>substantive</em><br />
matters)</li>
<li><strong>In Rem</strong> – The<br />
issue is about the property itself eg a claim to title or status<br />
of the property. Usually land, sometimes property is U.S. v.<br />
Boxes of Pepsi, Bananas etc.</li>
<li><strong>Quasi in rem</strong> –<br />
The action is <strong>not </strong>concerning the property but the property<br />
or debt is seized by attachment and the D will only be liable for<br />
no more than the property used to gain quasi in rem</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Hess<br />
v. Powloski </strong>pg 82-85</p>
<ol>
<li>Implied consent to PJ<br />
by operating a vehicle in the state (most states)</li>
<li>This former MA statute<br />
held that there was jurisdiction over anyone who operated a motor<br />
vehicle in the state.</li>
<li>Modern theory not<br />
“implied consent” but the states simply have the right to<br />
exercise police power to protect their own citizens from crazy<br />
out of state drivers</li>
<li><strong>HOLDING </strong>by<br />
driving in the forum state you are submitting to PJ and may be<br />
served process in ANY ACTION arising out of a motor vehicle<br />
accident. (Where the line to “ANY” action is drawn is anyones<br />
guess)</li>
<li><strong>Rule</strong>: State has<br />
the power to declare that all non-residents who use its highways<br />
have impliedly consented to submit to the state’s jurisdiction<br />
for all actions arising from that highway usage</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Kane<br />
v. New Jersey</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Out of state motorists<br />
must sign a paper consenting to allow a NJ agent to accept due<br />
process prior to driving on the highways</li>
<li><strong>RULE </strong>Motorists<br />
used to be required to consent to PJ before using the states<br />
highways</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Jurisdiction<br />
over individuals can be established by:</strong></p>
<ol type="i">
<li><strong>Presence</strong> in the<br />
forum state as long as service is made while the D is within the<br />
state borders</li>
<li><strong>Domicile</strong> where<br />
the person has his <em>current dwelling place </em>OR has an<br />
<em>intention to remain/return</em> to the state (You can only have<br />
one domicile at a time)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Residence </strong>Some<br />
states allow jurisdiction based on residence, you can have more<br />
than one residence.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Consent</strong><br />
by waiver of personal jurisdiction “OK fine sue me here”</li>
<li><strong>Driving a car</strong><br />
within the forum (Hess v Powloski)</li>
<li><strong>Committing a tort<br />
</strong>long arm will allow</li>
<li><strong>Owning property </strong>in<br />
the forum</li>
<li><strong>Conducting business<br />
</strong>with minimum contacts (Int. Shoe Co. v. WA)</li>
<li>Being married to a<br />
citizen of the forum <strong>BUT you must have minimum contacts</strong> ie<br />
a NY father sending his daughter to visit mother in CA is NOT<br />
minimum contacts sufficient for PJ</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Class<br />
3</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>“Personal Jurisdiction”<br />
over corporations and Others</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><strong>International Shoe<br />
Co. v. Washington</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Had traveling salesmen<br />
taking orders for shoes then mail the orders to HQ. Did these<br />
salesmen submit Int Shoe to PJ in Washington?</li>
<li>Due process requires<br />
only that the D has minimum contact with the forum state. Minimum<br />
contacts are found when the entity conducts systematic and<br />
continuous business within the forum</li>
<li>Purposeful availment</li>
<li>Combined the doctrines<br />
of Implied Consent (Hess) and Express Consent (Kane) forming the<br />
MINIMUM CONTACTS Standard</li>
<li><strong>HOLDING</strong> Yes<br />
minimum contacts with the forum state are sufficient to establish<br />
PJ consistent with Due Process.</p>

<li>P brought a shareholder<br />

<li><strong>Shareholder<br />
derivative suit</strong> “A <strong>shareholder<br />
derivative suit </strong>is a lawsuit<br />
brought by a shareholder<br />
on behalf of a corporation<br />
against a third party. Often, the<br />
third party is an insider of<br />
the corporation, such as an executive officer or director.<br />
Shareholder derivative suits are unique because under traditional<br />
corporate law,<br />
management is responsible for bringing and defending the<br />
corporation against suit. Shareholder derivative suits permit a<br />
shareholder to initiate a suit when management has failed to do<br />
so.” &#8211; <em>Wikipedia</em></li>
<li>None of the violating<br />
activities took place in DL and main place of business activities<br />

<li><strong>HOLDING</strong><br />
court rejected <em>Quasi In Rem</em><br />
over the shares of stock because the suit has nothing to do with<br />
in state property and it is just a slick way to attempt<br />
jurisdiction over the owner of the stock. This is obvious because<br />
DL doesn&#8217;t allow “special appearance” and this is just a<br />
sneaky way to force the D to appear submitting to a general<br />
appearance. Used the “minimum contacts” test from <em><strong>Int<br />
Shoe</strong></em> to decide that QinRem<br />
was unsuitable.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong><br />
In principle this case kills Quasi In Rem in CA because we have an<br />
expanded long arm statute over anything as long as it is<br />
constitutional. The court here rejected traditional arguments for<br />
<em>quasi in rem</em><br />
especially the argument that a D should not avoid liability by<br />
removing his assets to a location outside jurisdiction.</li>

How to Present Defenses.</strong></h4>
<p>Every defense<br />
to a claim for relief in any pleading must be asserted in the<br />
responsive pleading if one is required. But a party may assert the<br />
following defenses by motion:</p>
<dl>
<dd>(1) lack<br />
of subject-matter jurisdiction;</p>
</dd>
<dd>(2) lack<br />
of personal jurisdiction;</p>

<p>A motion<br />
asserting any of these defenses must be made before pleading if a<br />
responsive pleading is allowed. If a pleading sets out a claim for<br />
relief that does not require a responsive pleading, an opposing party<br />
may assert at trial any defense to that claim. No defense or<br />
objection is waived by joining it with one or more other defenses or<br />
objections in a responsive pleading or in a motion.</p>

Motion For a More Definite Statement.</strong></h4>
<p>A party may<br />
move for a more definite statement of a pleading to which a<br />
responsive pleading is allowed but which is so vague or ambiguous<br />
that the party cannot reasonably prepare a response. The motion must<br />
be made before filing a responsive pleading and must point out the<br />
defects complained of and the details desired. If the court orders a<br />
more definite statement and the order is not obeyed within 14 days<br />
after notice of the order or within the time the court sets, the<br />
court may strike the pleading or issue any other appropriate order.</p>

court&#8217;s leave [permission]. The court should freely give leave<br />
when justice requires.</li>
<li>3. Time to respond:<br />
Unless the court orders otherwise, any required response to an<br />
amended pleading must be made within the time remaining ot respond<br />
to the original pleading OR within 14 days after service of the<br />
amended pleading whichever is LATER</li>
<li>(b) Amendments During<br />
and after trial</p>
<ol>
<li>Based on an objection<br />
at trial: If at trial a party ojects to evidence as being outside<br />
the original pleading the court may allow the pleading to be<br />
amended. The court should allow if it will aid in the merits and<br />
will not prejudice the parties action or a defense on the merits</li>
<li>For issues Tried by<br />
Consent: When an issue is tried by express or implied consent it<br />
will be considered to have been part of the pleading.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(c) An<br />
amendment Relates back when:</p>
<ol>
<li>A) the statute of<br />
limitations allows it to relate back OR</li>
<li>B) the amendment<br />
asserts a claim or defense from same T/O; OR</li>
<li>C) the amendment<br />
changes the naming of the party under 15(c)(1)(B)^^ within RULE<br />
4(m) for serving summons, the party to be brought in</p>
<ul>
<li>(i.) received such<br />

<li>(d) Supplemental<br />
Pleadings → A court may on just terms allow amendment for an<br />
event that occurred AFTER the original pleading, and will prob<br />
require the other party to respond within a specific time</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>General<br />
Principles</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Diversity (different<br />
citizens diff states) v. Federal Question</li>
<li>Amount in controversy<br />
exceed $75,000</li>
<li>Burden the party waning<br />
to invoke the jurisdiction must make an affirmative showing that it<br />
is within the courts SMJ (ie the pleading/complaint) must allege<br />
the SMJ</li>
<li>Dismissal at ANYTIME for<br />
lack of SMJ → RULE 12(h)(3)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Diversity<br />
Jurisdiction § 1332</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>No party on either side<br />
of the “v.” can be from the same state</p>
<ol>
<li>Date<br />
for determining citizenship is <strong>as of the commencement of the<br />
action.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A later change in<br />
citizenship does not affect (create OR destroy) diversity</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Domicile:<br />
<strong>citizenship </strong>is DECIDED BY DOMICILE (<em>not residence).</em><br />
Domicile is one place where the person intends to stay. To<br />
establish new domicile you must go there AND intend to stay</p>
<ol>
<li>Resident alien is<br />
deemed a citizen of the state he is domiciled in</li>
<li>Presence of a foreign<br />
citizen (French Guy) or foreign country does not destroy<br />
diversity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Complete<br />
diversity IS REQUIRED (unless specifically excepted)</li>
<li>Pleading  not<br />
dispositive, the pleading itself doesnt determine who exactly is<br />
an adverse party for diversity, the court arranges parties<br />
according to their real interest in the litigation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Nominal<br />
parties are ignored for diversity ie a guardian suing on behalf<br />
of an infant (infant&#8217;s citizenship decides diversity)</li>
<li><em><strong>Pete<br />
Rose v. Giamatti, MLB, C Reds.<br />
</strong></em>Diversity<br />
should be established by the major parties ie <strong>Giamatti</strong><br />
in the <em>Pete Rose v. Giamatti,<br />
MLB, C Reds.</em> not by the<br />
nominal or formal parties. A nominal/formal party in a genuine<br />
legal sense has no real interest in the result of the suit.<br />
Rose<br />
wants to sue in Ohio, Giamatti wants the case removed to federal<br />
court.<br />
Court holds that diversity of citizenship exists<br />
because MLB and C Reds are at best nominal parties</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Alienage<br />
Jurisdiction<br />
Mexican v. D(American) is considered diversity as<br />
long as it exceeds $75k</p>
<ol>
<li>Suit solely among<br />
foreigners doesnt count as diverse ie Mexican v. Canadian</p>
<ol>
<li>Resident alien living<br />
in the US is a citizen of that state for diversity purposes</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Diversity<br />
involving partnerships and corporations</p>
<ol>
<li>Partnerships, Union<br />
LLCs, LLPs, dont have a single citizenship. It is a citizen of<br />
each members state of citizenship</li>
<li><strong>Corporation </strong>Is a<br />
citizen where it is incorporated AND its Principal Place of<br />
Business</p>
<ol>
<li>Principal<br />
Place of Business is either:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Nerve Center –<br />
Decision making center, corporate HQ, etc</li>
<li>Corporate activities<br />
test &#8211; the location of the production or service activities</li>
<li>Total activity test -<br />
Hybrid of Nerve and CorpActivities balances the relevant factors<br />
to see which is weighted more heavily</li>
<li><em><strong>Hertz<br />
v. Friend</strong></em> <em>2010</em><br />
says to use the Nerve Center</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Fabricated<br />
diversity by “improperly or collusively joined” parties will<br />
not be tolerated §1359</p>
<ol>
<li>Assignment: You can not<br />
“hire” someone else to bring the suit for you</li>
<li>Devices<br />
to defeat removal to federal Ct there is no statue BUT courts will<br />
often disregard obvious removal-defeating tactics like joining a D<br />
that is irrelevant</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Low<br />
Dollar Claim </strong>less than $75k CAN<br />
be used, but must be claimed before removal is requested by D</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Federal<br />
Question Jurisdiction</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Federal Ct has authority<br />
(not required) to hear Federal Question cases §1331 (if a FQ is<br />
brought in state court it cannot be removed if D is a citizen of<br />
that state)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Federal<br />
Claim</strong>: <em>There<br />
is NO DEFINITION exactly</em> but<br />
mostly because federal law is the source of the P&#8217;s claim.</p>
<ol>
<li>Interpretation of<br />
federal law does NOT COUNT. A state based claim that requires<br />
interpretation of federal law is not a FQ</li>
<li><strong>Claim<br />
based on the merits </strong>If the claim<br />
arises under Fed Law it qualifies even if the claim is invalid on<br />
the merits (in the latter case will be dismissed on 12(b)(6)<br />
failure to state a cliam NOT 12(b)(1) no SMJ</li>
<li><strong>Anticipation<br />
of Defense </strong>does not satisfy FQ<br />
(Louisville RR v Mottley free train passes)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Amount<br />
in controversy</p>
<ol>
<li>Applies to Diversity ONLY<br />
must exceed $75,000</li>
<li>Standard<br />
of proof – P only has to show with <em>some<br />
certainty </em>that it exceeds that<br />
much</p>
<ol>
<li>Legal certainty cannot<br />
be dismissed for lack of amount UNLESS it can be shown with legal<br />
certainty that the claim is really only for less</li>
<li>Eventual Recovery<br />
unimportant</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Most<br />
courts say it must be worth $75,000 to P (others may look at D<br />
valuation of the item as well)</li>
<li><strong>Aggregation of Claims</strong>
<ol>
<li>Aggregation by a single<br />
P v. single D: P may add all claims together to make +$75</p>
<ol>
<li>Aggregation only works<br />
against a single D and uses supplemental §1367</li>
<li>Additional D: a P who<br />
has aggregated his claims against one D may not join claims<br />
agains other D&#8217;s UNLESS those claims meet the juris amount</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Aggregation<br />
by multiple P</p>
<ol>
<li>IF one of the P&#8217;s meets<br />
the amount then other P&#8217;s can join as long as same T/O under<br />
supplemental §1367 (Exxon v. Allapatah)</li>
<li>Aggregation NOT ALLOWED<br />
IF No single claim meets the amount (unless 2 P&#8217;s are asserting a<br />
single title or right with a common undivided interest)</li>
<li><strong>Class<br />
Actions</strong> in diversity as long as<br />
one named P meets the +$75K amount then others dont need to</li>

<li><strong>Supplemental<br />
Jurisdiction </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Under<br />
SuppJuris some claims might not have to meet SMJ if excepted under<br />
§1367</p>
<ol>
<li>§ 1367 replaced<br />
pendent/ancillary jurisdiction</li>
<li>§ 1367(a) “In any<br />

jurisdiction over all other claims of the&#8230; same case or<br />

or intervention of additional parties”</li>
<li><strong>Federal<br />
Question </strong>when the original claim<br />
is a FQ §1367 allows the court to here ANY same T/O state claims</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Defensive<br />
Posture Required </strong>Additional<br />
claims by D&#8217;s basically fall under §1367, but additional claims<br />
(or addition of parties) by P&#8217;s is generally NOT given<br />
supplemental. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SO EXPECT<br />
SUPPLEMENTAL ONLY WHERE THE CLAIMANT TRYING TO BENEFIT IS USING<br />
IT IN A </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“DEFENSIVE<br />
MANNER”</strong></span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Discretion<br />
to reject exercise of 1367 </strong>because<br />
§1367(c) gives four reasons why the court may decline<br />
supplemental jurisdiction. Most often because the original claim<br />
with SMJ has been dismissed.</li>
<li><strong>No<br />
effect on PJ </strong>1367 supplemental<br />
does not eliminate the PJ requirement or the need for valid<br />
service. Supplemental <strong>1367 Only<br />
effects SMJ (</strong>but often under<br />
supplemental the 100mi bulge will apply)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Venue<br />
</strong>when supplemental 1367 applies<br />
Venue will not need to be satisfied for new parties with respect<br />
to the new party.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>REMOVAL<br />
TO THE FEDERAL COURTS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Removal<br />
Generally </strong>generally any action<br />
brought in State Court that COULD have been in Fed Court MAY be<br />
removed by D</p>
<ol>
<li>UNLESS any D is a<br />
citizen of the State court where the diversity action was brought<br />
(exception for class-actions which may be removed)</li>
<li>Where suit goes: When a<br />
case is removed it goes to the Federal Court in the district where<br />
the state-court sits</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Diversity<br />
and amount apply in removal for SMJ</li>
<li><strong>P<br />
cannot remove ever </strong>ONLY a D may<br />
remove. A P defending a counterclaim cannot remove.</li>
<li>Look ONLY at P&#8217;s<br />
complaint → If injury bills are $100k and P only sues for $60k<br />
this WILL PREVENT removal by D because the complaint control.</li>
<li><strong>Removal<br />
of Multiple Claims </strong>Where P asserts<br />
against D two claims in state court one of which could be removed<br />
alone, and the other could not it gets TRICKY</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Diversity<br />
</strong>if the basis for removal of the<br />
second claim is <em>diversity</em><br />
then the whole case is barred from removal</li>
<li><strong>Federal<br />
Question case </strong>if the second claim<br />
is a FQ and the other claim has no independent fed jurisdiction<br />
then D may remove the whole case § 1441(c)</p>
<ol>
<li>BUT the Fed Ct can<br />
remand the state-court claim</li>
<li>AND can even remove the<br />
FQ if the state claim is found to be the predominate controversy</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Compulsory<br />
remand </strong>If the federal judge<br />
concludes that removal did not satisfy the 1441requirements SHE<br />
MUST remand</li>
<li><strong>Mechanics of Removal </strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Time<br />
</strong>D must file removal within 30<br />
days of receiving the state-court complaint</li>
<li>All D must be joined in<br />
removal (except purely nominal ones)</p>
<ol>
<li>If removed under<br />
1441(c) “separate federal claim” then only D to the FQ need<br />
to be on the notice</li>

<li><strong>Nature<br />
of the Problem</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Generally Cases that can<br />
be heard in Fed Ct can ALSO be brought in State Ct, BUT what Law<br />
should be used?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Forum Shopping</strong> To<br />
prevent forum shopping the courts will generally apply state<br />
<em>substantive law</em> in diversity cases.</li>
<li><strong>Rules of Decisions<br />
Act § 1652 </strong>is based on the supremacy clause tells which law<br />
to apply: “The laws of the several states, except where the<br />
Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of Congress<br />
otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of<br />
decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in<br />
cases where they apply.”</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Federal Applies </strong>when<br />
there is a applicable Constitution, treaty, or statute enacted by<br />
Congress. ← These all take precedent over state law</li>
<li><strong>State<br />
Statutes IF</strong> there is not a Federal Constitution or Statute on<br />
Point then → Fed court MUST use the State Statute</li>
<li><strong>Dispute about common<br />
law</strong> If there is NO Fed OR State Statute then follow<em><strong><br />
Erie</strong></em></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Erie<br />
v. Tompkins </strong></em>In DIVERSITY cases The Federal Ct MUST apply<br />
State common law on any <em>Substantive Law </em>issues (This rule is<br />
contrary to <em>Swift v. Tyson</em> where the Fed could ignore state<br />
common law)</p>
<ol>
<li>Erie says that Rules of<br />
Decisions Act intends to apply State Common Law in Fed Ct<br />
diversity cases.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Erie<br />
Problems</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Ascertaining State law<br />
only easy when the highest state court has <em>recently</em> spoken<br />
on the issue (It is tricky when only Lower Cts have heard the<br />
issue). It is up to the Fed Ct to determine how the States Highest<br />
Ct would <em>see the Issue TODAY!!!</em></p>
<ol>
<li>IF there is an<br />
Intermediate Ct decision then the Fed Ct will generally follow<br />
this UNLESS there is good reason to believe the St Supreme would<br />
see the issue differently</li>
<li>IF no state court has<br />
spoken then the Fed Ct will look to <em>prior Fed Diversity Cases.<br />
</em>OR the <em>decisions from other state courts.</em></li>
<li><em>OLD </em>obsolete<br />
State Decisions the Fed Court is at its discretion to conclude<br />
that the State court would hold differently now</li>
<li>Federal Ct (even AppCt)<br />
must follow any NEW state court decisions even if decided after<br />
the original Fed Jgmnt</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Conflict<br />
of laws </strong>Fed Ct must follow State Conflict laws.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ex P soldiers are<br />
injured by defective grenades while in Iraq. P dues the<br />
manufacturer in TX court. TX tort law allows strict liability,<br />
Iraq does not. Texas state conflict of laws holds that the tort<br />
law where the accident occurs (Iraq) are applied therefore no<br />
recovery.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Burden<br />
of Proof </strong> The fed court must allow the rules governing the<br />
allocation of the burden of proof in force in the state where the<br />
federal ct is sitting</li>
<li><strong>Procedural vs<br />
Substantive distinction </strong>Erie v. Tompkins holds that state<br />
common law controls in “substantive” matters. But federal rules<br />
and policies control in matters that are procedural</p>
<ol>
<li>Federal Rules take<br />
precedence: Erie only applies when there is no controlling federal<br />
statute because of the RDA → ask (1) Does the rule apply to the<br />
issue? (2) Is the rule valid under RDA? If yes to both then follow<br />
federal rule.</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the rule apply? →<br />
ex RULE 3 says action “commenced when filed” P files before<br />
SofL <strong>but serves</strong> after! KY law says Statute of Limitations<br />
is satisfied when process is served. Here RULE 3 does not<br />
specifically address <em>SO STATE Statute Of Limitations</em> law<br />
must be followed in a Fed Ct therefore the <em><strong>action is too<br />
late</strong></em></li>
<li><strong>Is the Rule Valid?<br />
</strong>RDA says the rule Must not “abridge, enlarge, [or[ modify<br />
the substantive rights of any litigant.” But as long as the<br />
rule is procedural it will satisfy this test. NO FEDERAL rule has<br />
EVER been found to violate the “no abridge, enlarge, modify”<br />
test of the RDA. ie FEDERAL RULES</li>
<li><strong>Illustration</strong> P<br />
sues D in Mass Fed Ct. D is executor of an estate. P serves Ds<br />
wife by leaving the summons at his dwelling. RULE 4(e)(2) allows<br />
leaving at dwelling BUT Mass has an exception for service on an<br />
executor of an estate which says you cant leave with someone<br />
else. <em>Hanna v. Plumer</em><br />
<strong>HOLDING </strong>follow the Fed<br />
RULE here because it trumps any valid State Rules</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Case<br />
not covered by a Federal RULE but is still procedural.</p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>Bird v. Blue<br />
Ridge </strong></em>Rejected a Pure Outcome Determinative Test.</li>
<li>Instead of outcome<br />
determinative the court now BALANCES which rule is WEIGHTIER.<br />
Where the state interest is fairly weak follow Fed if the Fed<br />
policy carries more WEIGHT</p>
<ol>
<li>Judge/Jury allocation:<br />
Follow Federal policies</p>
<ol>
<li>Byrd v. Blue Ridge Is<br />
the P an employee (workers comp) OR a contractor (tort) Here<br />
the federal policy is stronger, the state policy is not as<br />
concerned with the parties rights and the choice is not very<br />
outcome determinative.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Unanimity<br />
for Jury trials according to Federal Rules will be applied (as<br />
apposed to a less than unanimous state jury policy to avoid<br />
hung). The state policy has little weight here ans is less then<br />
outcome determinative.</li>
<li>Statute<br />
of Limitations → FOLLOW STATE SofL because the state's<br />
interest is heavily outcome determinative</li>

<li><strong>Federal Common law<br />
still exists </strong>BUT Erie makes it clear there is no general common<br />
law, there are still particular instances when fed common law is<br />
applied. Fed court can occasionally disregard state common in favor<br />
of fed common-law</li>
<li><strong>Federal Question </strong>cases<br />
→ Federal Common Law APPLIES usually</p>
<ol>
<li>Ex P sues the D(U.S.) in<br />
TX fed court, the court should apply federal common law here even<br />
if the US would not be negligent under TX law. So the P would win</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Diversity<br />
Case: </strong>Occasinally Fed Common can be applied in diversity ie<br />
when a D asserts a defense that uses federal lawnmower</li>
<li><strong>Fed Common Law in<br />
State Court: </strong>States will occasionally be required to use Fed<br />
Common Law</p>
<ol>
<li>Ex<br />
P brings a claim in state court against D(a city) for deprivation<br />
of civil rights. State law requires claim within 120 days. HOLDING<br />
state-court may not impose this state rule since it would Abridge<br />

you from bringing it later)</li>

Supplemental under 1367 <em>does not apply</em> to a joined claim.<br />
(But SMJ probably wont be a problem because P v D can aggregate<br />
and it will be diverse already)</li>

to sue several co-defendants P v D D D</p>
<ol>
<li>Joinder of P: P may<br />

<li>It is a single T/O</li>
<li>OR a common question of<br />
law or fact</li>

<li>It is a single T/O</li>

<li>Joinder of D is ALWAYS<br />

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Jurisdiction<br />

must be met for EACH D and each D must be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Served with process</li>
<li>Ct must have PJ (by min<br />

for joinder of parties</strong>: All parties joined under RULE 20 must<br />
meet SMJ supplemental generally doesnt apply to Rule 20 joinder<br />
of multiple defendants</p>
<ol>
<li>Diversity MUST BE<br />
COMPLETE for joinder of parties</li>
<li>Aggregation<br />
as long a ONE P MEETS the requirement [Exxon Mobil v Allapattah<br />
Serv In]</p>
<ol>
<li>Where the RULE 20<br />
Joinder involves multiple D&#8217;s supplemental jurisdiction does not<br />
apply even for the amount in controversy, EACH D must have<br />
claims against him meeting the jurisdictional amount</li>
<li>P1 $80k &#8212;&gt; D1$15k <strong>t/o</strong>&gt; D2<br />

<li><strong>Necessary parties</strong>:<br />
Less important parties that (1) must be joined if it can be done<br />
(2) if there are jurisdiction problems with this party the action<br />
will continue</li>
<li><strong>Indispensable<br />
Parties</strong>: Action must be dropped if this party cannot join<br />
RULE 19(b)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Necessary<br />
Defined</strong>: a party is necessary – and must be joined if<br />
jurisdictionally possible – if the party is not “indispensable”<br />
and either OR of these is met ::</p>
<ol>
<li>Incomplete relief: In<br />
the parties absence complete relief cannot be given to the<br />
parties OR</li>
<li>Impaired interest: The<br />
absent party has an interest relating to the action, and trying<br />
the case without them will impair that party&#8217;s interest or leave<br />
one of the current parties open to multiple or inconsistent<br />
obligations</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Indispensable<br />
Defined</strong>: If a party meets the requirement for necessary the<br />
court will then  decide if the party is indispensable</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Consequences of<br />
indispensability</strong>: IF indispensable then the action is<br />
dismissed without this party</li>
<li>Looks to 4 factors
<ol>
<li>(1) the extent of<br />
prejudice to the absentee, or those already parties</li>
<li>(2) the possibility of<br />
framing the judgement so as to mitigate prejudices</li>
<li>(3) the adequacy of<br />
remedy that can be granted in the party&#8217;s absence</li>
<li>(4) whether the P will<br />
have an adequate remedy IF the action is Dismissed</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<li><strong>Jurisdiction</strong>:<br />
Where a non-party who must be joined if feasible does not meet<br />
jurisdiction or amount in controversy then he cannot be joined</li>

<li><strong>Intervention</strong>
<ol>
<li>RULE 24 you can enter<br />
yourself into a lawsuit by intervening</p>
<ol>
<li>Two forms of<br />
intervention under Rule 24</p>
<ol>
<li>Intervention of right<br />
Rule 24(a); and</li>
<li>Permissive intervention<br />
Rule 24(b)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Distinction<br />
the intervention “Of Right” no leave of court is required.<br />
Conversely “Permissive Intervention” requires the courts<br />
discretion to let the party in.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Intervention<br />
Of Right</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Three tests to determine<br />
IOR must meet ALL:</p>
<ol>
<li>Interest in the<br />
subject-matter (ie the property/transaction at issue) AND</li>
<li>Impaired interest: Her<br />
interest in that ^ property will be impaired if she is left out<br />
AND</li>
<li>Inadequate<br />
Representation: She must show her interest is not already<br />
adequately represented by the existing parties.</p>
<ol>
<li>NOTE if one of these<br />
tests fails She May Still get in under 24(a) IF a Federal<br />
Statute gives her the right (ie the U.S. May intervene in any<br />
case involving the constitutionality of an act of congress)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Jurisdiction:<br />
Must meet independent  SMJ to intervene based on diversity</p>
<ol>
<li>Intervention is NOT<br />
covered by supplemental juris 1367</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Permissive<br />
Intervention:</strong> The new party merely must have a “claim or<br />
defense” that involves a “common question of law or fact”</p>
<ol>
<li>Up to the discretion of<br />
the trial court, rarely reversed on appeal</li>
<li>Jurisdiction: intervener<br />
MUST meet independent SMJ</li>

<li><strong>Interpleader</strong>
<ol>
<li>Interpleader allows a<br />
party who owes something to 2 or more people to have them “<strong>fight</strong><br />
amongst themselves” to decide who gets the cash.<br />
<em>ex.</em> X<br />
and Y (fighters) both claim ownership of a bank account at Bank Y,<br />
the Bank can tell X and Y to fight each other for it first an then<br />
the bank only has to pay the winner<br />
<em>To avoid double liability</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Federal Practice allows<br />
two kinds of Interpleader</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Statutory<br />
Interpleader </strong>under 28 USC § 1335 AND</li>
<li><strong>Rule Interpleader<br />
</strong>under RULE 22</p>
