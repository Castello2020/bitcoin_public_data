Using documents leaked by National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/new-snowden-revelations-on-nsa-spying-in-germany-a-975441.html"><em>Der Spiegel</em> reports that the NSA  has turned Germany</a> into its most important base of operations in Europe. "NSA is more active in Germany than anywhere else in Europe," reports the paper, "And data collected here may have helped kill suspected terrorists."


<p>
<blockquote><p>The German archive provides the basis for a critical discussion on the necessity and limits of secret service work as well as on the protection of privacy in the age of digital communication. The documents complement the debate over a trans-Atlantic relationship that has been severely damaged by the NSA affair.
<p>
They paint a picture of an all-powerful American intelligence agency that has developed an increasingly intimate relationship with Germany over the past 13 years while massively expanding its presence. No other country in Europe plays host to a secret NSA surveillance architecture comparable to the one in Germany. It is a web of sites defined as much by a thirst for total control as by the desire for security. In 2007, the NSA claimed to have at least a dozen active collection sites in Germany.
<p>
The documents indicate that the NSA uses its German sites to search for a potential target by analyzing a "Pattern of Life," in the words of one Snowden file. And one classified report suggests that information collected in Germany is used for the "capture or kill" of alleged terrorists.<p></blockquote>

The Project on Government Oversight (POGO) has <a href="http://www.pogo.org/our-work/letters/2014/va-inspector-general-issues-subpoena-for-pogo.html">told the Obama administration</a> that its leaders will go to jail rather than respond to an extrajudicial administrative subpoena seeking the identity of whistleblowers who disclosed corruption in the Veterans' Administration.</p>]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/3830011213_8f2c926238_o.jpg" class="bordered" width="100%"><br />
<p>
The Project on Government Oversight (POGO) has <a href="http://www.pogo.org/our-work/letters/2014/va-inspector-general-issues-subpoena-for-pogo.html">told the Obama administration</a> that its leaders will go to jail rather than respond to an extrajudicial administrative subpoena seeking the identity of whistleblowers who disclosed corruption in the Veterans' Administration.
 <span id="more-310076"></span>
POGO operates an anonymized submission portal for whistleblowers to report government wrongdoing. The administrative subpoena -- which has no "probable cause" requirement -- <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/to-defeat-encryption-feds-deploy-the-subpoena/?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+arstechnica%2Findex+%28Ars+Technica+-+All+content%29">seeks the crypto keys for the portal</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>


POGO launched its submission tool in the immediate aftermath of the disclosure of the Veterans Administration scandal, which on Monday blossomed to revelations that as many as 57,000 vets have been awaiting treatment for as long as three months each because of 1990s-era scheduling technology. The agency is also accused of trying to cover that up.
<p>
The subpoena from the Department of Veteran's Affairs Inspector General demands from POGO records related to "wait times, access to care, and/or patient scheduling issues at the Phoenix, Arizona VA Healthcare System and any other VA medical facility."
<p>
On Monday, POGO told the Obama administration that it would not comply with the subpoena. Most government agencies have such subpoena powers, and they have been doled out hundreds of thousands of times, all with the signature of federal officials as no judge is required. The subpoenas demand that utilities, ISPs, telecommunication companies, banks, hospitals, and bookstores cough up information if the authorities deem it relevant to an investigation.

<blockquote>
<p>


Dotcom goes on to reiterate a long-standing claim, that the action against him and Megaupload was a “corrupt contract prosecution” carried out by the White House in order to get Hollywood’s support for Obama’s re-election campaign. He’s interested in evidence that supports that assertion.
<p>
“Former Senator and now MPAA chairman Chris Dodd and Vice President Joe Biden in particular have abused their political power to make the pre-trial destruction of Megaupload possible,” he explains.
<p>
“Joe Biden’s personal counsel (while Biden was still a Senator) Neil MacBride was promoted to a top position at the DOJ and oversaw the Megaupload destruction. We have already exposed a whole range of unlawful government conduct in the Megaupload case, backed by court rulings.”
<p>
So presuming people have information, what should they do with it? Dotcom suggests going to a well-known newspaper with a proven track-record in handling leaks.

2600's Emmanuel Goldstein writes, "This summer's HOPE X conference has added another major whistleblower to its schedule: Thomas Drake, who was charged under the Espionage Act in 2010 after revealing waste, fraud, and abuse at the NSA. The government would later drop these charges, after ruining Drake's career and dragging his name through the mud. Drake was one of the opponents of the NSA's Trailblazer program in 2002, which wound up costing billions of taxpayer dollars and would have been a huge violation of privacy, had it not been cancelled in 2006. It wouldn't be the last such program, and Drake wouldn't be the last whistleblower. HOPE X takes place July 18-20 at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City. More info at <a href="http://xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx"> xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx</a> or <a href="http://x.hope.net">x.hope.net</a>."

I'm pretty sure it's the oldest continuously-running website devoted to the public exposure of secret documents for the public good, and has weathered constant attack and intimidation by entities who would rather that websites like Cryptome not exist.
<p>
 The website run by John Young and Deborah Natsios <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1874173687/cryptome-global-archives">has a kickstarter campaign</a>, and it's worth considering kicking in if radical transparency is something you support. <p><span id="more-306894"></span>





<blockquote>Cryptome publishes documents prohibited worldwide, in particular material on freedom of expression.
<p>
Cryptome has been primarily funded for 18 years by its operators with modest funding by donations for copies of its archives. Outside support would be appreciated but the site will continue in any event.
<p>
Cryptome publishes documents prohibited worldwide, in particular material on freedom of expression, privacy, cryptology, dual-use technologies, national security, intelligence, and secret governance -- open, secret and classified documents -- but not limited to those.

<p>NBC <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/edward-snowden-interview/exclusive-edward-snowden-tells-brian-williams-u-s-stranded-him-n116096">released a preview clip</a> from a widely-promoted Brian Williams interview with whistleblower Edward Snowden, which airs tonight, Wednesday May 28, at 10pm EDT. The hour-long interview is the former NSA contractor’s first US television interview since leaking NSA documents to reporters. <span id="more-306604"></span>
<p>
NBC says the interview was “shrouded in secrecy due to Snowden’s life in exile since leaking classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs a year ago.” <p>
Williams describes Snowden as "blindingly smart," despite the fact <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/business/media/to-get-snowden-interview-nbc-news-relied-on-secrecy.html">that he only has a high school GED</a>.

On NBC, Williams also interviews Snowden with reporter Glenn Greenwald, and they discuss how they ended up working together on the reporting. <p>

Snowden <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/us/politics/snowden-says-he-was-a-spy-not-just-an-analyst.html">says he was trained as a spy</a>, not a low-level contractor as previously stated by government reps. "I personally am surprised that I ended up" in Russia, he tells Williams. Snowden says he was stranded in Russia by his own government. 


<p>



<blockquote><p>The reality is I never intended to end up in Russia. I had a flight booked to Cuba onwards to Latin America and I was stopped because the United States government decided to revoke my passport and trap me in Moscow Airport. So when people ask why are you in Russia, I say, 'Please ask the State Department.'<p>
</blockquote>

<p>


On NBC Today, Secretary of State John Kerry calls that "dumb." 

<p>




<blockquote>For a supposedly smart guy, that’s a pretty dumb answer, frankly. If Mr. Snowden wants to come back to the United States today, we'll have him on a flight today. We'd be delighted for him to come back. He should come back. That's what a patriot would do. A patriot would not run away and look for refuge in Russia or Cuba or some other country. A patriot would stand up in the United States and make his case to the American people. He can come home but he’s a fugitive from justice which is why he is not being permitted to fly around the world.
</blockquote>



<p>

On <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/05/28/john-kerry-edward-snowden-should-man-up-and-return-to-the-u-s/">CBS News,</a> the Secretary of State said Snowden should "should man up and come back to the United States." <p>
Under Espionage Act charges, however, Snowden would not be entitled to <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/01/sen-schumer-wrong-snowden-would-be-barred-arguing-his-case-trial">a trial by a jury of his peers</a>.

<a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/edward-snowden-interview/exclusive-edward-snowden-tells-brian-williams-u-s-stranded-him-n116096">Here's a preview</a> clip from the interview. NBC will likely release more video online after the broadcast.]]></content:encoded>

The Veterans Administration worker who leaked damning information about the federal agency has a name: Sam Foote. He is an internist, and for 19 years was a VA outpatient clinic director.<span id="more-306257"></span>

<p>

 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/24/opinion/why-i-blew-the-whistle-on-the-va.html?_r=0">He wrote an op-ed for the <em>New York Times</em></a>:


<blockquote><p>
My decision to become a whistle-blower after 24 years as a physician in a Veterans Affairs hospital was, at first, an easy one. I knew about patients who were dying while waiting for appointments on the V.A.’s secret schedules, and I couldn’t stay silent.
<p>
But there was no response to the two letters I sent to the Veterans Affairs inspector general, one in late October 2013 and one in early February. Going public would damage an institution I gave more than two decades of my life to, trying to make a better place for veterans to get their care. But I had to be able to sleep at night.
<p></blockquote>

Dr. Foote retired from the VA's Phoenix, Arizona medical center in December 2013. He continued to contact lawmakers, but he also contacted a reporter at the Arizona Republic, and <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/politics/vahealthsystem/">a series of articles about deaths</a>, suffering, and financial waste caused by mismanagement followed.<p>

On CNN's Reliable Sources this past Sunday, <a href="http://reliablesources.blogs.cnn.com/2014/05/25/va-whistleblower-tells-his-story/">he told CNN's Brian Stelter about his decision</a> to expose treatment delays at the Phoenix VA hospital, and how he went about blowing the proverbial whistle. <p>

<span id="more-305487"></span>
<p>
<div id="attachment_305490" style="width: 670px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2013-06-27-at-11.42.21-AM-660x493.png" alt="ATT/NSA Whistleblower Mark Klein." width="660" height="493" class="size-full wp-image-305490" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><br />ATT/NSA Whistleblower Mark Klein.</p></div>
 Former AT&#038;T technician Mark Klein was a whistleblower who worked with then-LAT reporter <a href="http://www.josephmenn.com/">Joseph Menn</a> for months on a story of how the spy agency tapped into central communications hubs to surveil communications. <p>But the story was spiked by Baquet.<p> <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2007/03/whistleblower_h/">As ABC News reported it</a>, the exclusive was "killed at the request of then-Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte and then-director of the NSA Gen. Michael Hayden. Baquet confirmed to ABCNews.com he talked with Negroponte and Hayden but says 'government pressure played no role in my decision not to run the story.' Baquet says he and managing editor Doug Frantz decided 'we did not have a story, that we could not figure out what was going on' based on Klein’s highly technical documents."
<p>




<blockquote><p>Baquet says he and managing editor Doug Frantz decided “we did not have a story, that we could not figure out what was going on” based on Klein’s highly technical documents. The reporter, Menn, declined to comment, but Baquet says he knows “Joe disagreed and was very disappointed.”<p>
Klein says he then took his AT&#038;T documents to The New York Times, which published its exclusive account last April. <p> </blockquote>

<p>


NYT reporters <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/13/us/nationalspecial3/13nsa.html?pagewanted=all">John Markoff and Scott Shane eventually broke the news</a>. Everyone else <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/news-coverage-mark-klein-washington">followed</a>.<p>
<p>

 Klein became a key witness in the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s class action lawsuit, <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/hepting">Hepting vs AT&#038;T</a>. When Edward Snowden leaked a massive cache of secret NSA documents last year, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/06/nsa-whistleblower-klein/">Klein was effectively vindicated</a>. 
<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/josephmenn">Joe Menn</a> now reports "highly technical" stories for Reuters.

<p>
What kind of editor will Baquet be when the next big leak rolls in?

<p>Sadly, it was quite predictable that the White House and CIA would delay the release of a report, which is reportedly devestating in its criticism of the CIA, and will remind the public that the Obama administration refused to hold anyone at the CIA accountable for its crimes. Disturbingly, the CIA itself—the same agency the report accuses of years of prisoner abuse and systematic lying—is in charge of the redaction process for the report, despite the fact that it has already dragged its feet for over a year, has been accused of misleading the Senate Intelligence Committee, and even allegedly spied on its staffers all in an apparent attempt to prevent the report from seeing light.</p>

<p>The UN Special Rappateur on Torture, Juan Mendez—himself a survivor of torture—<a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/04/abu-ghraibs-ghosts-106069.html#.U2golK1dXR0">recently wrote</a> that the CIA’s role in the process “a preposterous conflict of interest,” lamenting that “[o]nce again, the torturers will have the opportunity to censor what the public can know.”</p>

<p>The silence and delay by the US government is all the more reason <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/05/leak-cia-report-torture-redacted-transparency">why the CIA Torture Report should be leaked to the public</a>. Of course, we wish that the official transparency process was not broken, and that the report would go through a fair and quick declassification review. But unfortunately, time and again, the administration has prevented information about government wrongdoing from coming out through official channels.</p>

<p>Last week was <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/04/abu-ghraibs-ghosts-106069.html#.U2golK1dXR0">the tenth anniversary</a> of the release of the Abu Gharib photos, the first hint the American public received about the torture committed by the US government under the Bush administration. Notably, the public saw these photos only because they were leaked to the press, just <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/05/leak-cia-report-torture-redacted-transparency">like much of the information</a> we would later learn about the CIA’s torture program.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, in recent years the Justice Department has prosecuted a record number of news sources, and Sen. Feinstein, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has led the charge for more. Worse, Sen. Feinstein—despite advocating for the release of the torture report—has said she’s already <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140414/13510626908/dianne-feinstein-asks-doj-to-investigate-leak-torture-report-summary-to-mcclatchy-news-service.shtml">referred a leak</a> related to an <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/04/11/224195/senate-intelligence-committee.html">article by McClatchy about the torture report's findings</a> to the Justice Department. </p>

<p>The government’s <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2013/05/justice-department-investigation-ap-part-larger-pattern-intimidate-sources-and">crackdown against leaks</a> is one reason why Freedom of the Press Foundation has helped news organizations install <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/securedrop">SecureDrop</a>, an open-source whistleblower submission system that helps sources get documents to journalists in a much more anonymous and secure way than email. Currently, journalists at five major news organizations in the United States use SecureDrop. If a potential source wants to use it, they need to follow these simple steps: </p>



<ol>
	<li>Find a public wifi internet connection that is not connected to your work or home, such as a coffee shop.</li>
	<li><a style="line-height: 1.538em;" href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en">Download</a>, install, and load the <a style="line-height: 1.538em;" href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en">Tor Browser Bundle</a> (or for more security, the <a style="line-height: 1.538em;" href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails operating system</a>). </li>
	<li>Using the Tor Browser, enter in your news organization’s <a style="line-height: 1.538em;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion">onion URL</a> (see below). Remember: only attempt to load this URL inside the Tor Browser.</li>
	<li>Follow the instructions on the SecureDrop screen. </li>
</ol>

<p>Here are onion URLs of the five groups of journalists at major US news organizations currently operating SecureDrop:</p>

<p><strong>The Intercept:</strong> y6xjgkgwj47us5ca.onion</p>

<p><strong>ProPublica:</strong> pubdrop4dw6rk3aq.onion</p>

<p><strong>New Yorker:</strong> strngbxhwyuu37a3.onion</p>

<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> bczjr6ciiblco5ti.onion</p>

<p><strong>Wired's Kevin Poulsen: </strong>poulsensqiv6ocq4.onion</p>

<p>Of course nothing can guarantee 100% security, and sadly any government official would be taking a great personal risk by leaking anything, including the torture report, to journalists. But it increasingly looks like the public will need a brave official willing to take a courageous stand if we are to get real transparency and accountability anytime soon.</p> </p>

REUTERS/Gaston De Cardenas</p></div><p>Hillary Clinton <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2014/04/hillary-clinton-faults-edward-snowden-for-fleeing-187445.html">made her first extended public remarks</a> about Edward Snowden late last week, and unfortunately she misstated some basic facts about the NSA whistleblower and how events have played out in the last year. Here’s a breakdown of what she said and where she went wrong:</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: "If he were concerned and wanted to be part of the American debate, he could have been… I don't understand why he couldn't have been part of the debate at home."</strong></p>
<p>This is one of the biggest misconceptions about Snowden that even NSA reform advocates <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2013/12/if-snowden-returned-us-trial-all-whistleblower-evidence-would-likely-be-inadmissible">have furthered</a>. Edward Snowden could not be part of this debate at home, period.</p><span id="more-299749"></span>


<p>First, as Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellbserg <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/daniel-ellsberg-nsa-leaker-snowden-made-the-right-call/2013/07/07/0b46d96c-e5b7-11e2-aef3-339619eab080_story.html">explained in the Washington Post</a>, Snowden would likely be in a maximum security prison right now if he remained in the United States, unable to speak to the media. Second and more importantly, Snowden would likely be barred from making any of arguments claiming he was a whistleblower during his trial, since the government is charging him under the draconian Espionage Act of 1917. As we have <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/02/guilty-plea-fox-news-leak-case-shows-why-espionage-act-prosecutions-are-inherently">pointed out</a> <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/01/sen-schumer-wrong-snowden-would-be-barred-arguing-his-case-trial">repeatedly</a>, lower court rulings in other cases against leakers have prevented defendants from telling a jury about their intent to inform the American public, the lack of harm their leaks caused, and the benefits to society. The government even tried to bar NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake from mentioning the words “whistleblower” or “First Amendment” during his trial.</p>
<p>Simply put, it would be impossible for Edward Snowden to participate in an informed debate in the public or the courtroom if he was in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: "When he emerged and when he absconded with all that material, I was puzzled, because we have all these protections for whistleblowers."</strong></p>
<p>What’s really puzzling is that Ms. Clinton—and President Obama (who has made similar remarks)—is not familiar with the current state of the law as it relates to whistleblowers. Contractors like Snowden <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/loopholes-exclude-intelligence-contractors-snowden-whistleblower-protections-1301913">lack the protections</a> that federal employees are entitled to, and the government is <a href="http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/07/glenn-greenwald/greenwald-nsa-leaker-snowden-has-no-whistleblower-/">free to retaliate</a> against such people under the law. As Angela Canterbury, director of public policy at the Project on Government Oversight, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/loopholes-exclude-intelligence-contractors-snowden-whistleblower-protections-1301913">has explained</a>: “[T]here is a gaping loophole for intelligence community contractors. The riskiest whistle-blowing that you can possibly do on the government is as an intelligence contractor.”</p>
<p>Despite the risks, Snowden has said he repeatedly went his superiors with complaints and they were never acted upon. From <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2014/04/edward-snowden-interview">his interview with</a> Vanity Fair:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The N.S.A. at this point not only knows I raised complaints, but that there is evidence that I made my concerns known to the N.S.A.’s lawyers, because I did some of it through e-mail. I directly challenge the N.S.A. to deny that I contacted N.S.A. oversight and compliance bodies directly via e-mail and that I specifically expressed concerns about their suspect interpretation of the law, and I welcome members of Congress to request a written answer to this question [from the N.S.A.].”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Clinton: "I have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia under Putin's authority."</strong></p>
<p>Snowden did not “take refuge” in Russia at all, and in fact, it’s the fault of the United States government he was stuck there. Snowden’s legal adviser Ben Wizner <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/53936585/ns/meet_the_press-transcripts/t/dec-david-kirkpatrick-darrell-issa-joaquin-castro-ben-wizner-eugene-robinson-andrea-mitchell-robin-wright-elliot-abrams-peter-stearns/#.U15-dsenTK0">put it best</a> when asked about this on <em>Meet the Press</em> last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>I actually think if there is one thing that we all should agree on, it’s that Edward Snowden shouldn’t be in Russia.  The reason why he’s in Russia is that the United States revoked his passport when he was transiting through there.  And I hope that the U.S. will-- will see that it’s not in anybody’s best interests for him to be there, and that even if he isn’t going to return here, that there should be some other place where he can live.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Clinton: "I think turning over a lot of that material—intentionally or unintentionally, because of the way it can be drained—gave all kinds of information, not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist groups and the like."</strong></p>
<p>Snowden <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/18/world/snowden-says-he-took-no-secret-files-to-russia.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">has repeatedly stated</a> he did not turn over information to anyone besides journalists, he did not even take any data with him to Russia, and the US government has not put forth any evidence that a foreign government has gained access to information that is not in the public record. Thankfully, Snowden is highly trained in protecting data in high-risk places, as <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2014/04/hillary-clinton-faults-edward-snowden-for-fleeing-187445.html">he even once taught a DIA course</a> in the subject to other diplomats.</p>
<p>Ms. Clinton is widely considered the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for President in 2016. It’s very possible she was just testing the waters about how to react to the issue of NSA surveillance. We hope she will takes these facts into consideration and adjust her opinion accordingly. Bill Clinton <a href="http://wtvr.com/2014/04/09/bill-clinton-says-pretty-decent-things-about-edward-snowden/">was much more conciliatory and nuanced</a> about people's anger over the NSA when he made comments a few weeks ago, so it would be easy for her to switch gears. And if <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=snowden%20clinton%20vote&amp;src=typd">these tweets are any indication</a>, privacy could be a more important election issue than ever.</p>
<p><em>Note: Edward Snowden is a member of Freedom of the Press Foundation's board of directors. </em></p>]]></content:encoded>

A noble mission for sure. But maybe they should kick off the campaign by criticizing their own Justice Department, which on the very same day, <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2014/04/justice-department-urges-scotus-to-pass-up-reporters-187455.html">has asked the Supreme Court</a> to help them force Pulitzer Prize winning <em>New York Times</em> reporter James Risen into jail.</p><span id="more-299458"></span>


<p>Politico's <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2014/04/justice-department-urges-scotus-to-pass-up-reporters-187455.html">Josh Gerstein reports</a> that the Justice Department filed a legal brief today urging the Supreme Court to reject Risen's petition to hear his reporter's privilege case, in which the Fourth Circuit <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2013/07/court-guts-reporters-privilege-one-most-significant-press-freedom-cases-decades">ruled earlier this year</a> that James Risen (and all journalists) can be forced to testify against their sources without any regard to the confidentiality required by their profession. This flies in the face of common law precedent all over the country, as well as the clear district court reasoning in Risen's case in 2012. (The government's Supreme Court brief <a href="http://images.politico.com/global/2014/04/25/usrisenscotusbrief.html">can be read here</a>.)</p>
<p>Associated Press reporter Matthew Lee commendably grilled the State Department spokesman about the contradiction of its press freedom campaign and the James Risen case at <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2014/04/225195.htm">today's briefing on the State Department initiative</a>, repeatedly asking if the government considers press freedom issues in the United States the same way it does aboard. The <a href="#briefing">full transcript is below</a>.</p>
<p>As Gerstein noted, "The Justice Department brief is unflinchingly hostile to the idea of the Supreme Court creating or finding protections for journalists," and if the Justice Department succeeds "it could place President Barack Obama in the awkward position of presiding over the jailing of a journalist in an administration the president has vowed to make the most transparent in history."</p>
<p>The government does mention it is working with Congress to craft <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2013/05/white-house-shield-bill-could-actually-make-it-easier-government-get-journalists">a reporter's shield bill</a>, which should give you some indication that the proposed bill is at best a <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2013/05/white-house-shield-bill-could-actually-make-it-easier-government-get-journalists">watered-down, toothless version</a> of what many courts have offered journalists for decades, and that would be no help to James Risen—the exact type of reporter that we should be attempting to protect the most. It's important to remember that in Risen's case, the government <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/18/reporters-privilege-obama-war-leaks-new-york-times_n_1527748.html">has previously analogized</a> reporter's privilege to a criminal receiving drugs from someone and refusing to testify about it.</p>
<p>We'll have more on both the shield law and the Risen case soon, but it's clear that the US government still refuses to walk the walk when providing journalists the protections it says it believes in.</p>
<p>Oh, and while we're on the subject, maybe the State Department can use its "Free the Press" campaign to put pressure on one of its staunchest allies, the United Kingdom, which is <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2013/05/white-house-shield-bill-could-actually-make-it-easier-government-get-journalists">using terrorism laws to suppress acts of journalism</a>—something the State Department <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2013/11/will-us-state-dept-condemn-uks-attempt-use-terrorism-laws-suppress-journalism">has condemned many times</a> in the past.</p>
<p><a name="briefing" id="briefing"></a>Here's the full interaction between the AP's Matthew Lee and the State Department spokesperson Jennifer Psaki on James Risen and US press freedom <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2014/04/225195.htm">at today's State Department briefing</a>:</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>JENNIFER PSAKI: </strong></span></span><span>One more announcement for all of you: With World Press Freedom Day around the world on May 3rd, the department will launch its third annual Free the Press campaign later this afternoon in New York at the U.S. U.N. mission. Beginning on Monday and all of next week, we will highlight emblematic cases of imperiled reporters and media outlets that have been targeted, oppressed, imprisoned or otherwise harassed because of their professional work. The first two cases will be announced by Assistant Secretary -- Assistant Secretary Tom Malinowski later at the -- at U.S. U.N. And we invite you of course to follow Tom at Twitter, who has -- on Twitter who, as you all know, was just confirmed several weeks, @Malinowski and to keep up with human rights issues on DRL's website.</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span>With that --</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>Q</strong></span>: Sure. Just on that, reporters who are, what, harassed? I'm sorry --</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>MS. PSAKI:</strong></span> Targeted, oppressed, imprisoned or otherwise harassed.</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>Q</strong></span>: Otherwise harassed. Does that include those who may have been targeted, harassed, imprisoned and otherwise whatever by the United States government?</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>MS. PSAKI:</strong></span> I'm --</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>Q</strong></span>: No?</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>MS. PSAKI:</strong></span> I think you're familiar with our Free the Press campaign, Matt, but --</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>Q</strong></span>: Fair enough. So it does not include those who might have been harassed by --</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>MS. PSAKI:</strong></span> We highlight, as we often do, where we see issues with media freedom around the world.</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>Q</strong></span>: Right, I understand. But you would say that you don't -- the U.S. does not believe that it has a problem with press freedom, or if it does, that it's not nearly as severe as the problems in other countries.</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>MS. PSAKI:</strong></span> We do not. I think we can look at many of the problems --</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span>On media press freedom?</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span>Oh. Go ahead. And then we'll go to you, (Paul ?).</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span>Did you have another question on media press freedom, or --</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS">...</p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>Q</strong></span>: If I could just go back to the overall, in general, the administration does not regard attempting to prosecute American journalists as an infringement of press freedom?</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>MS. PSAKI:</strong></span> I'm not sure which case you're -- what you're referring to.</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>Q</strong></span>: Well, there's several cases that are out there right now. The one that comes -- springs to mind is the James Risen case, where the Justice Department is attempting to prosecute. I just want to be clear. I'm not trying to --</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>MS. PSAKI:</strong></span> Well, Matt, I --</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>Q</strong></span>: I just want to know if you regard that as an infringement on press freedom or not. And I suspect that you do not, but I want to make sure that that's the case.</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>MS. PSAKI:</strong></span> As you know, and I'll, of course, refer to the Department of Justice, but the leaking of classified information is in a separate category. What we're talking about here, as you all know and unfortunately we have talk about on a regular basis here, is the targeting of journalists, the arrests, the imprisonment for simply exercising their ability to tell the story.</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>Q</strong></span>: Right. I understand that. And we're all, I'm sure, myself and all my colleagues, we're very appreciative of that.</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span>But the reporters in question here have not leaked the information; they simply published it. So is it correct, then, that you don't believe -- you don't regard that as an infringement of press freedom?</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>MS. PSAKI:</strong></span> We don't. I don't have anything more to say on that case.</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>Q</strong></span>: OK.</span></p>
<p class="PTRANS"><span><span><strong>MS. PSAKI:</strong></span> Do we have a new topic?</span></p>

Emmanuel from 2600 writes, "It should come as no surprise that <a href="http://x.hope.net/">dissent is playing a prominent role at the HOPE X conference this July in New York</a>. So many technological developments of late involve standing up to authority and questioning the status quo. Whether it's using social media to organize people into doing something worthwhile, exposing security holes in the face of threats and lawsuits, becoming a whistleblower by using the information and technology we have access to, or just getting the word out about the latest laws, restrictions, and threats to our freedom and privacy, a lot of what we talk about constitutes one form or another of dissent. And it feels pretty good and healthy to speak out and share knowledge."

<span id="more-298818"></span>

<blockquote>
<p>
The new dissent-themed HOPE X website has just gone live and it features images of a number of notable people who stood up to authority in one way or another. These are our kindred spirits, people who would understand the true meaning of being a hacker in today's world.

In addition to the new site, HOPE X is announcing a deadline of April 30 for speaker submissions. HOPE X is the tenth in the series of Hackers On Planet Earth conferences and it takes place July 18-20, 2014 at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City.

<p><span id="more-297519"></span>
Today's decision is a vindication for everyone who believes that the public has a role in government. We owe it to the efforts of the brave reporters and their colleagues who kept working in the face of extraordinary intimidation, including the forced destruction of journalistic materials, the inappropriate use of terrorism laws, and so many other means of pressure to get them to stop what the world now recognizes was work of vital public importance.
<p>
This decision reminds us that what no individual conscience can change, a free press can. My efforts would have been meaningless without the dedication, passion, and skill of these newspapers, and they have my gratitude and respect for their extraordinary service to our society. Their work has given us a better future and a more accountable democracy.<p>
--<strong>Edward Snowden, April 14, 2014</strong><p>

<a href="http://www.2600.com/">2600 Magazine</a>'s Emmanuel Goldstein writes, "Acclaimed whistleblower <a href="http://www.2600.com/?q=content/daniel-ellsberg-keynote-hope-x">Daniel Ellsberg will be keynoting at this summer's HOPE X conference in New York City</a>. Ellsberg leaked the infamous Pentagon Papers, 7,000 pages of documents that wound up changing American history forever. Today's whistleblowers are treated far more harshly, both by the authorities and the mainstream media, often facing lengthly prison terms or a life on the run. Fortunately, Ellsberg has remained involved and connected. A whole new generation will hear his words in person and hopefully be inspired to reveal the truth from whatever corporate or government position they find themselves in."

The UK tax authority HMRC <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/24/hmrc-criticised-mps-terror-law-tax-whistleblower-hodge">abused the country's controversial anti-terrorism law to spy on a whistleblower</a> and journalists at the Guardian after it was embarrassed by the revelation that it had given a sweetheart deal to Goldman Sachs. Osita Mba revealed a government oversight body that HMRC forgave GBP10M in interest owed by Goldman Sachs after a failed tax-evasion scheme, and in the ensuing public furore, HMRC's top executives invoked RIPA, the country's anti-terror law, to spy on its employees and on Guardian journalists in order to discover the identity of the leaker. Under RIPA, HMRC is able to spy on the nation's emails, Internet traffic, text messages, phone records and other sensitive data. 
<p>
Lin Homer, the head of HMRC has appeared before a Parliamentary committee to explain its use of anti-terror spying powers to uncover the identity of a whistleblower whose personal information is protected by legislation, and was unrepentant, and would not rule out doing it again in the future.
<p>
Margaret Hodge, the committee chair, expressed shock at this. But it was under her party's last government, the Blair regime, that RIPA was put into place, over howls of protest from campaigners who predicted that it would be used in just this way.

<span id="more-294610"></span>

<blockquote>
<p>
The MP told Homer she was particularly surprised "that you made a request under Ripa, which is there to deal with terrorism". She asked for assurances that HMRC would "never again use these powers on a whistleblower".
<p>
However, Homer declined to offer Hodge the desired reassurance, responding: "You know that we cannot offer carte blanche assurances for evermore that we won't use these … I have other duties of care to parliament and other individuals."
<p>
Using the Public Interest Disclosure Act, Mba wrote in confidence to the National Audit Office (NAO) and two parliamentary committees in 2011 saying that the then head of tax, Dave Hartnett, had "let off" Goldman Sachs from paying at least £10m in interest.

In <a href="http://blog.unwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/Brown-v.-WIPO-final.pdf">this International Labour Office complaint</a>, Miranda Brown, a former employee of the World Intellectual Property Agency, alleges that WIPO Director General Francis Gurry illegally collected DNA samples from WIPO staffers in order to out a whistleblower. The complaint stems from Gurry's campaign to secure the Director General's job, during which an anonymous staffer posted letters alleging that Gurry engaged in sexual harassment and financial improprieties. Brown, who was forced to resign, says that Gurry secretly directed UN security officers to covertly collect lipstick, dental floss, and other personal items from WIPO staffers in order to attain DNA samples that could be used to identify the letters' author. Gurry is also implicated in a multi-million dollar construction scandal over the building of the new WIPO HQ, which took place when he was legal counsel to the agency.
<p>
The entire affair is incredibly sordid, with multiple cover-ups. The complaint paints a picture of a reign of absolute terror, with staffers fearful of reprisals from Gurry over any questioning or reporting of a pattern of bullying, impropriety, harassment and defamation. Having served as a delegate to WIPO, I find it all rather easy to believe. I have never encountered a body more openly corrupt in my life.

<span id="more-286621"></span>

<P>
"The National Security Agency is using complex analysis of electronic surveillance, rather than human intelligence, as the primary method to locate targets for lethal drone strikes," <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/02/10/the-nsas-secret-role/">Jeremy Scahill and Glenn Greenwald report</a>, "An unreliable tactic that results in the deaths of innocent or unidentified people."
<p>
As <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1xidhe/glenn_greenwald_and_jeremy_scahill_the_nsas/?utm_source=twitterfeed&#038;utm_medium=twitter">Redditor actual_hacker said in a thread</a>, the big point of this article: "The US has built a SIM-card kill list. They're shooting missiles at cell phones without caring about who is holding the phone. That is why so many innocent people keep getting killed. That is what this story is about. The next time someone says "it's just metadata," remember this story. Innocent people die because of NSA's use of metadata: the story cites 14 women and 21 children killed in just one operation. All because of metadata."<p>

Image: Stephen Kim Legal Defense Trust.</p></div><p>Former State Department official Stephen Kim announced today he will <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/07/us-usa-security-kim-idUSBREA161JH20140207">plead guilty</a> to leaking classified information to Fox News journalist James Rosen and will serve 13 months in jail.</p>
<p>The case sparked controversy last year <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2013/05/conspiracy-commit-journalism-justice-depts-dangerous-new-argument-threatens-basic">when it was revealed</a> the Justice Department named Rosen a “co-conspirator” in court documents for essentially doing his job as a journalist. But a <a href="http://blogs.fas.org/secrecy/2013/07/prosecutors-burden/">largely ignored ruling</a> in Kim’s case may have far broader impact on how sources interact with journalists in the future.</p><span id="more-286291"></span>
<p>In Espionage Act cases involving sources or whistleblowers, defendants naturally want to explain to a judge or jury that the information they may have given to journalists (and the American public) didn’t harm US national security. The bar for this was already too low; in the past, the government didn't have to show <em>actual</em> harm, but at least they had to show the information could <em>potentially </em>harm national security. The judge in Kim’s case ruled the government didn’t even need to do that.</p>
<p>As secrecy expert Steven <a href="http://blogs.fas.org/secrecy/2013/07/prosecutors-burden/">Aftergood reported at the time</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/jud/kim/072413-opinion3.pdf">ruled</a> that the prosecution in the pending case of former State Department contractor Stephen Kim <strong>need not show that the information he allegedly leaked could damage U.S. national security or benefit a foreign power,</strong> <strong>even potentially</strong>.  Her opinion was a departure from a 30-year-old ruling in the case of <em>U.S. v. Morison</em>, which held that the government must show that the leak was potentially damaging to the U.S. or beneficial to an adversary. (emphasis ours)</p></blockquote>
<p>This means that it doesn’t matter if the information leaked by Kim was properly classified, or if it should have been classified at all. Kim could not argue the information he gave to Rosen may have been innocuous. The ruling also gives the government carte blanche power to classify whatever it wants—including waste, abuse, and crimes—and keep it secret under the threat of prosecution of anyone who could potentially reveal it. As the defense <a href="http://blogs.fas.org/secrecy/2013/07/prosecutors-burden/">argued at the time</a>, this ruling turns the Espionage Act into an Official Secrets Act, which Congress has continually refused to enact over the last century.</p>
<p>Because of this ruling, and other rulings in Espionage Act cases that bar defendants from explaining their intent to inform the American public to a jury, Kim likely had no choice to plead guilty. This is also why if Edward Snowden came back to the US he quite literally <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/01/sen-schumer-wrong-snowden-would-be-barred-arguing-his-case-trial">cannot receive a fair trial</a>: he would be <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/01/sen-schumer-wrong-snowden-would-be-barred-arguing-his-case-trial">legally barred from making his case</a> in court.</p>
<p>The Kim case yet another example of the broken nature of how the government deals with leaks, in which the Justice Department has complete discretion to ignore the leaks they like, and prosecute the leaks they don’t like. Kim’s lawyer <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61010074/AbbeLowell.txt">Abbe Lowell made this point</a> eloquently in his statement today:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stephen’s case demonstrates that our system for prosecuting leaks in this country is broken and terribly unfair. Lower-level employees like Mr. Kim are prosecuted because they are easier targets or often lack the resources or political connections to fight back. High-level employees leak classified information to forward their agenda or to make an administration look good with impunity. In fact, in this case, news reports from the same day demonstrate that Stephen was not the only government employee discussing the topic at issue. Stephen may have told the reporter what the reporter already knew from others, but Stephen was the only one charged.</p>
<p>“Leak” cases are prosecuted under the Espionage Act, a 100-year-old law with crushing penalties that was never intended to apply to conversations between a government employee and a news reporter. The Act and its penalties are designed to punish traitors and spies – not State Department analysts answering questions from the media about their area of expertise. Stephen faced more than a decade in jail for the type of public discussion of foreign policy issues that ought to be encouraged. This Administration and Congress should address these problems, as they undermine the basic fairness of our criminal justice system.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s clear the Espionage Act is inherently unfair to sources and whistleblowers. As Congress debates NSA reform, they should also be considering repealing the Espionage Act once and for all.<p>]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
A Syrian defector who worked for the regime as a forensic photographer <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/20/evidence-industrial-scale-killing-syria-war-crimes"">leaked over 55,000 photos detailing the deaths of at least 11,000 people, almost all young men</a>, believed to have been political prisoners who were in custody of the Bashar al-Assad regime. The photos were validated by a trio of globally recognized human rights lawyers with experience at the International Criminal Court. One of the lawyers, Professor David Crane, did an <a href="http://podcast.cbc.ca/mp3/podcasts/asithappens_20140121_72886.mp3">interview</a> (MP3) with CBC Radio's As It Happens in which he compared the photos of the bodies to the pictures that emerged from the Nazi's death camps; saying that they were emaciated to the point of death and showed evidence of brutal torture.  The photos came to light on the eve of a fresh round of peace-talks between the Assad regime and the various rebel factions in Syria.

<span id="more-282039"></span>

<blockquote>
<p>
"The procedure was that when detainees were killed at their places of detention their bodies would be taken to a military hospital to which he would be sent with a doctor and a member of the judiciary, Caesar's function being to photograph the corpses … There could be as many as 50 bodies a day to photograph which require 15 to 30 minutes of work per corpse," the report says.
<p>
"The reason for photographing executed persons was twofold. First to permit a death certificate to be produced without families requiring to see the body, thereby avoiding the authorities having to give a truthful account of their deaths; second to confirm that orders to execute individuals had been carried out."
<p>
Families were told that the cause of death was either a "heart attack" or "breathing problems", it added. "The procedure for documentation was that when a detainee was killed each body was given a reference number which related to that branch of the security service responsible for his detention and death.
<p>
"When the corpse was taken to the military hospital it was given a further number so as to document, falsely, that death had occurred in the hospital. Once the bodies were photographed, they were taken for burial in a rural area."
<p>
Three experienced forensic science experts examined and authenticated samples of 55,000 digital images, comprising about 11,000 victims. "Overall there was evidence that a significant number of the deceased were emaciated and a significant minority had been bound and/or beaten with rod-like objects," the report says.

Jesselyn Radack is a civil liberties attorney with the <a href="http://www.whistleblower.org/">Government Accountability Project</a> who has been in contact with Edward Snowden. In an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/10/more-nsa-leakers-followed-snowdens-footsteps-whistleblower-lawyer-says/">ABC News interview</a>, she reported that other NSA insiders have been inspired by Snowden's bravery and sacrifice and have come forward with further revelations about the organization's excess, criminality and lawlessness. She says that the Obama administration's war on whistleblowers has backfired, squandering the administration's credibility with its own operatives and inspiring them to speak out.

<span id="more-265787"></span>

<blockquote>
<p>


“I think the government hopes to chill speech by employees in the national security and intelligence fields, especially those at the NSA and CIA, but the unintended consequence is [that] more and more whistleblowers are coming through the doors of the Government Accountability Project (GAP),” said Jesselyn Radack, referring to the organization where she works as the National Security and Human Rights Director. “I think courage is contagious, and we see more and more people from the NSA coming through our door after Snowden made these revelations.”
<p>
Radack, an attorney who has met with and been in communication with Snowden, said “a handful” of people in the intelligence community have come forward since this summer when several major international newspapers began writing about the NSA’s classified foreign and domestic surveillance programs – stories based on thousands of secret NSA documents allegedly stolen by Snowden, a former NSA contractor.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/logo.jpg" alt="" title="logo" width="494" height="458" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262158" /><p>
Freedom of the
Press Foundation <a
href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/securedrop">has taken
charge</a> of the DeadDrop project, an open-source whistleblower
submission system originally coded by the late transparency advocate
Aaron Swartz. In the coming months, the Foundation <a
href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/securedrop#contact">will also
provide on-site installation</a> and technical support to news
organizations that wish to run the system, which has been renamed
“SecureDrop.”
<p>
By installing <a
href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/securedrop">SecureDrop</a>,
news organizations around the world can securely accept documents from
whistleblowers, while better protecting their sources’ anonymity.&nbsp;
Although it is important to note that no security system can ever be 100
percent impenetrable, Freedom of the Press Foundation believes that this
system is the strongest ever made available to media outlets. Several
major news agencies have already signed up for installations, and they
will be announced in the coming weeks.
<p>
“We’ve reached a time in America when the only way the press can assure
the anonymity and safety of their sources is not to know who they are,”
said JP Barlow, co-founder and board member of Freedom of the Press
Foundation. “SecureDrop is where real news can be slipped quietly under
the door.”
<p><span id="more-262155"></span>
Originally created by Swartz in partnership with investigative reporter
<a href="https://twitter.com/kpoulsen">Kevin Poulsen</a>, SecureDrop is
a Python application that accepts messages and documents from the web
and encrypts them for secure storage. Each source who uses the platform
is assigned a unique codename that lets the source establish a
relationship with the news organization without having to reveal her
real identity or resort to e-mail.
<p>
In addition to installation support, Freedom of the Press Foundation <a
href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/securedrop#contact">will
provide media organizations with instruction</a> on security best
practices and long-term technical support.&nbsp; Small media
organizations with significant financial need may also apply to Freedom
of the Press Foundation for help obtaining hardware. The New Yorker, the
first news organization to use the SecureDrop code, through its <a
href="http://www.newyorker.com/strongbox/">StrongBox project</a>, will
continue to operate its system in partnership with the Freedom of the
Press Foundation.

<p>

Freedom of the Press Foundation is hiring computer-security specialist
James Dolan to help maintain the SecureDrop code, install the system for
media organizations, and teach journalists about information
security.&nbsp; Dolan previously helped manage the <em>New Yorker</em>’s
installation of StrongBox, the magazine’s version of SecureDrop. He also
originally reviewed and hardened the security architecture before the
initial launch.
<p>
“Journalists are starting to recognize that sophisticated communications
security is a key element in the newsgathering process,” Freedom of the
Press Foundation’s Chief Technology Officer Micah Lee said.
<strong>“</strong>SecureDrop is the safest way we know for an anonymous
source to send information to journalists while protecting their identity.”
<p>
SecureDrop’s code has gone through <a
href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~aczeskis/research/pubs/UW-CSE-13-08-02.PDF">a
detailed security audit</a> by a team of University of Washington
researchers, led by Alexei Czeckis. Other authors of the audit include
renowned security expert Bruce Schneier and Tor developer Jacob
Appelbaum. Freedom of the Press Foundation has made a number of updates
to SecureDrop based on these findings and will be making a significant
investment in continually improving the system. &nbsp;
<p>
“A truly free press hinges on the ability of investigative journalists
to build trust with their sources,” Freedom of the Press Foundation
Executive Director Trevor Timm said.&nbsp; “The recent NSA revelations
and record number of whistleblower prosecutions under the current
administration have shown the grave challenges to this relationship and
the lengths governments will go to undermine it.&nbsp; Freedom of Press
Foundation is committed ushering in a new era of security for
journalists and newsrooms of all sizes.”
<p>
Freedom of the Press Foundation offers thanks to Poulsen, <a
href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/05/strongbox-and-aaron-swartz.html">who
developed the original project</a> with Swartz, managed it for the first
six months since it went public, and is handing over the reins. Poulsen,
who serves as <em>Wired</em>’s investigations editor, is advising the
Foundation on the transition, and will continue to serve as a journalism
consultant on the project.
<p>
"The goal in creating this system was to see it implemented in newsrooms
far and wide," Poulsen said. "Freedom of the Press Foundation is the
perfect organization to do that."

Below, Andrea's thoughts.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The widely-published image of Chelsea Manning, released in dithered grayscale by the Army, strikes me as an apt metaphor for the layers of meaning in this case. We all live under the Tyranny of the Binary, the impulse to divide everything into black-and-white absolutes. It coerces people who see shades of gray to choose one extreme or the other. In the past week, the political positions on Manning have quickly accreted into two polarized views by the most vociferous partisans: Bradley the Traitor, and Chelsea the Hero. I hope most people see it as a little more nuanced than that.
<span id="more-252364"></span><p>
I’ve vacillated between sympathy and facepalm since Manning’s decision to announce a gender transition at this moment of white-hot scrutiny. It’s causing  the trans community to scramble in the same way the State Department had to  scramble in the wake of the earlier revelations. We’re having to address several issues that are difficult to explain all at once, as they are among the most polarizing issues we face. These include trans prisoners, taxpayer-funded trans health services, disease models of gender diversity, trans people in the military, and trans depictions in the media.<p>

It was obvious to me from the moment Xeni showed me the chat logs between Manning and Lamo in 2010 that Manning was trans. I asked Xeni to quote me  anonymously for <a href="http://boingboing.net/2010/06/20/was-alleged-wikileak.html">a 2010 Boing Boing post speculating on Manning’s gender identity</a> because I knew I’d catch a lot of flak in my community if my name got used.<p>

I had hoped I wouldn’t need to write about this ever, because airing disputes within marginalized groups is rarely politically expedient. We’ve had a pretty good run in terms of mainstream media depictions of trans people over the past few years, focusing the kind of friendly, non-threatening, assimilated people that many non-trans people can support: “Why, they’re a lot like us!” Many activists have spent their lives getting trans people to this place, including yours truly, and revelations like Manning’s have the potential to derail that progress among people inhabiting the vast middle ground between complete condemnation and full support.
<p>
The recently published selfie taken by Manning sitting all alone in a parked car, unsmiling, with heavy makeup and platinum blonde wig, as well as Manning’s accompanying email, felt very familiar to me. Because I created and maintain <a href="http://tsroadmap.com">one of the earliest informational sites on gender transition</a>, Manning’s is a story I have read many times in the last 20 years. I’ve answered thousands of emails from trans people in similar states of despair. I’ve heard of the sadness of having to remove that makeup, being extra mindful to get every last trace of mascara, packing away the wig and makeup or maybe even throwing them all away in a self-hatred-fueled binge/purge cycle. I had to hide my email address on my how-to site because I was answering as many as 200 emails a day from people in similar distress, reaching out like drowning victims. I still feel guilty that I’m better equipped to teach large groups of people how to swim rather than to save struggling individuals in crisis. It’s a grim math equation, but people in Manning’s situation can drag you down with them emotionally if you engage personally, leaving you too tired to help others who aren’t struggling as much.
<p>
Manning’s pre-military pictures experimenting with gender expression show these feelings were present long before enlistment. From our earliest memories, most trans people recall moments when they realized their identities were considered wrong or diseased by others. It’s easy to internalize that and become very secretive. Trans people often create lives for ourselves that attempt to suppress those feelings and that part of us. Joining the military is not uncommon, nor is committing to personal relationships where transition would mean the end.<p>
If you live in a gender hell of your own making, the feelings you are trying to suppress can manifest in other ways, often unhealthy ones. An insightful therapist named Anne Vitale has questioned the disease model of “gender identity disorder,” which suggests a problem within an affected person. She has instead suggested the concept of <a href="http://www.avitale.com/developmentalreview.htm">Gender Expression Deprivation Anxiety Disorder (GEDAD)</a>, where the real culprit is the suppression of one’s identity and expression in response to external pressures or self-hatred. This to me explains a number of similar phenomena, such as anti-gay religious or political leaders who are later revealed to be gay.

<p>

Though thousands of trans people have served honorably in the military and have held military and civil positions requiring high security clearances, many of them have had to do so without divulging their trans identities.  While “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” (DADT) has been repealed, that movement quickly lost momentum when it came time to seek the same rights for trans people. SLDN/Outserve, the largest LGBT servicemembers’ advocacy organization and an important factor in lobbying efforts to repeal DADT, <a href="http://americablog.com/2013/07/outserve-sldn-closes-headquarters-reveals-organization-bankrupt.html">imploded earlier this summer</a>. Fewer funders wanted to continue the fight, <a href="http://www.advocate.com/politics/military/2013/07/30/what-really-happened-when-outserve-sldn-came-undone">culminating in a messy dismissal of the trans executive director</a> and dissolution of the organization.<p>

Kristin Beck, a Navy Seal who transitioned after retirement, minced no words in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kristin.hills.125/posts/496798800413582">her initial response about Manning</a>:  “Some say hero? some say traitor? I just say ‘misguided, egotistical Liar and thief’ which can be applied to both hero or traitor depending on a few factors.” Beck later <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/25/chelsea-manning-military-transgender-revolution">wrote a more measured response</a> about Manning and the current status of trans people in the military.
<p>

It’s hard for me to see Manning as an unalloyed hero. Setting aside Manning’s data dump, just prior to arrest Manning was engaging in some very problematic and desperate behavior. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/wikileaks/8964543/Bradley-Manning-attacked-female-soldier-and-sent-picture-of-himself-as-a-woman.html">Manning assaulted Specialist Jihrleah Showman</a>, leading to loss of both security clearance and weapons privileges. Many articles implied the assault and the gender issues were connected. Gender identity distress does not absolve anyone of personal responsibility. There’s really no excuse for that kind of disgraceful behavior toward a superior, but people respond to stress and hopelessness in different ways. If Manning couldn’t get relief after disclosing a huge personal secret, maybe assaulting a superior and disclosing state secrets seemed like the only way out of a self-imposed gender hell. I’m not sure I completely buy Manning’s defense that this was initially done on principle. Despite the assertions to the contrary, Manning’s actions have the hallmarks of attention-seeking behavior, a sort of trolling done online by people struggling with personal issues. They also have the hallmarks of desperation and hopelessness of someone who felt they had exhausted all other options.<p>

Manning’s intent ultimately doesn’t matter. While I believe the end justifies the means in this case, and that it forced a much-needed conversation about U.S. military policy, I am uncomfortable with how a much-needed conversation about difficult trans issues suddenly became entwined in this controversy. Maybe eventually I’ll feel the same way I do about the data dump, but for now I feel like Manning’s gender revelations are moving people toward extremes rather than along the steady path of progress trans people have enjoyed for some time. <p>

But hey, progress happens in fits and starts. Let’s go ahead and have the conversations, difficult as they may be. Here’s hoping the U.S. military will be completely out of Afghanistan long before the end of Manning’s term, and that Manning and our country and the trans community will all be in a better situation then, too.]]></content:encoded>
