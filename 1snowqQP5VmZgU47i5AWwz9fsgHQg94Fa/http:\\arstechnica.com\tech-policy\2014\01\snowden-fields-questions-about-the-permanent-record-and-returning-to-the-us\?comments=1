Snowden considers returning to the US, and the “permanent record”
In a rare Q&A session, former NSA contractor talks about the future of spying.

In an online Q&A session, former NSA contractor-turned-whistleblower Edward Snowden answered 13 questions posed by Twitter users. The questions he considered ranged from the reasoning behind his leaks, to his hope for what the future of American intelligence programs may look like. In the session, hosted by a "Free Snowden" group, he noted the report presented on Thursday morning by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), which offered a harsh and unprecedented critique of the National Security Agency's mass surveillance program. According to PCLOB, this program in which the NSA collects millions of records of metadata on phone calls placed by American citizens daily, “was built on a murky legal foundation that raises many constitutional questions and has been proven to be an ineffective tool for collecting unique intelligence information.”
Snowden echoed that belief in his comments. “The fact that these records are gathered without the government having any reasonable suspicion or probable cause justifying the seizure of data is so divorced from the domain of reason as to be incapable of ever being made lawful at all," he wrote. "This view was endorsed as recently as today by the federal government’s Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight board."
The former contractor also wrote about his projections for the future. In responding to a question on how people should go forward knowing what they know now about the kind of mass surveillance carried out by the US government, Snowden responded that “the easiest way to ensure a country’s communications are secure is to secure them world-wide, and that means better standards, better crypto, and better research.” This response alludes to major revelations that the NSA deliberately worked a backdoor into an algorithm recommended by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Dual EC_DRBG. It has also been revealed that the NSA will exploit weaknesses in software to gather information, rather than tipping off the developers about their broken program.
After Snowden's leak hit front pages around the world in June 2013, the contractor fled to Hong Kong and then was granted temporary asylum in Russia. His stay in Russia will soon expire, and one participant in today's discussion asked what conditions would be necessary for him to consider return to the US. Snowden responded:
Returning to the US, I think, is the best resolution for the government, the public, and myself, but it’s unfortunately not possible in the face of current whistleblower protection laws, which through a failure in law did not cover national security contractors like myself.
The hundred-year-old law under which I’ve been charged, which was never intended to be used against people working in the public interest, and forbids a public interest defense. This is especially frustrating, because it means there’s no chance to have a fair trial, and no way I can come home and make my case to a jury.
Maybe when Congress comes together to end the programs the PCLOB just announced was illegal, they’ll reform the Whistleblower Protection Act, and we’ll see a mechanism for all Americans, no matter who they work for, to get a fair trial.
During the Q&A session, Snowden also stressed that he did not believe all spying was bad, but that indiscriminate collection of records was an egregious practice. Such massive databases “effectively create 'permanent records' of our daily activities,” Snowden wrote, “even in the absence of any wrongdoing on our part. This enables a capability called 'retroactive investigation,' where once you come to the government’s attention, they’ve got a very complete record of your daily activity going back, under current law, often as far as five years. You might not remember where you went to dinner on June 12th 2009, but the government does.”

It's important to remember that the "most transparent presidency ever" President Barack Obama has charged more journalists under the Espionage Act than all other presidents before him combined.

I think it's funny i got down voted in ars a few days ago for saying practically this:Quote:ntelligence agencies do have a role to play, and the people at the working level at the NSA, CIA, or any other member of the IC are not out to get you. They’re good people trying to do the right thing, and I can tell you from personal experience that they were worried about the same things I was.And snowden says the same thing. I do feel after reading more of snowdens words, he is more intelligent and thoughtful than I realized. When his leaks first came out I imagined him as an angry high school libertarian/anarchist type, but this does not seem to be the case. He may have even converted me to his side...

I'll look into the eight people and try to decipher which leaks may have actually been warranted or not (with some the information is still so scarce that no one can, which is ridiculous). I know Hitselberger, Kiriakou, and Jin Woo Kim are awfully guilty though.

The person who leaks the information committed a crime, a person without security clearance who obtains classified information, even if they tell others, is constitutionally protected.

Their emotionally charged rage gets projected onto snowden, when snowden is really a thoughtful, highly principled pragmatist.

Quote:even in the absence of any wrongdoing on our part. This enables a capability called 'retroactive investigation,' where once you come to the government’s attention, they’ve got a very complete record of your daily activity going back, under current law, often as far as five years.This is the argument he put forth on his first interview- the idea of the Government deriving suspicion based on information collected before they suspected anything. Then they can continue to dig until they find something about you that fits whatever narrative they have in mind. This kind of shady intel work is already happening with the DEA's Special Operations Division . DEA suspects that you are involved with the drug trade somehow, so they forward a semi-anonymous tip to local law enforcement. They give a cryptic message like: "Go to this location and pull over a car that looks like X, search them for drugs." Or, "find an excuse to get into the house at this location."Then the local police investigate, acting like they were the ones who sourced the info. Often, judges and defense attorneys don't even know where the original intel came from, or that the DEA was the tipster. The information is never vetted before it is used, and if anything incriminating is found, then the ends justify the means.One of the missions of the NSA is to encourage this kind of cross-department information sharing... and since it is all classified, nobody is going to question them about what they should or shouldn't share.

It sounds more like you have a problem with the function of the Espionage Act. The Obama administration is just following up what prior administrations have done with the E.A. In fact, three of the eight prosecutions during Obama's tenure were started by the previous administration. The Justice Department has always received tons of complaints about leaks, but without the trove of electronic receipts at their disposal they have now, prosecuting them was next to impossible (they actually were considered typically DOA when they reached the DOJ). This administration is following up on it, and going after the leakers rather than the journalists (though they do legally demand journalists hand over their shit, which I disagree with entirely for the reasons below).That the administration is doing it more effectively isn't the crime. Rather, I'd say it's that the E.A. itself most certainly needs to be narrowed in scope and re-worded. The Third Party Doctrine is antiquated filth from the 70s and runs roughshod over the Fourth Amendment. Normally journalists are exempted from this, yes, but nowhere is that set in stone constitutionally; it's merely a loose policy. With the Third Party Doctrine around, the government is basically fully within their legal (to say nothing of morals) rights to demand information from journalists. Demand change of that first, or from a legal perspective the argument is tough to make that this administration is encroaching on civil liberties of journalists (which I'd say they are).

If he's involved in this illegal and unconstitutional data collection, or if he's merely aware of it but says nothing, then he's helping to create a surveillance society that I think is objectively worse than the already-crappy discriminatory, punitive, economically-lopsided society we have now.Is that a terrible choice to have to make (providing for your family vs. serving your country by exposing government wrongdoing)? Sure, but that's just too bad; it's part of the responsibility that comes with the territory. If NSA employees don't want to be tarred with the same brush as their leaders, then they can stand up for the country and the taxpayers who pay their salaries and do something about it.If they aren't willing to do that, then - frankly - fuck 'em. They don't deserve my empathy or understanding.

With the Third Party Doctrine around, the government is basically fully within their legal (to say nothing of morals) rights to demand information from journalists. Demand change of that first, or from a legal perspective the argument is tough to make that this administration is encroaching on civil liberties of journalists (which I'd say they are).I never said that those prosecutions were illegal under the law as currently written, although I do think a decent SCOTUS would overturn the E.A. on constitutional grounds. However, pursuing those eight prosecutions was a choice made by people who serve at the pleasure of the President, and not pardoning those journalists was a choice made by the President personally. As such, I judge this administration on the basis of those unwarranted prosecutions. I believe their intent was to have a chilling effect on journalists, to intimidate them into not challenging the administration.

I do feel after reading more of snowdens words, he is more intelligent and thoughtful than I realized. When his leaks first came out I imagined him as an angry high school libertarian/anarchist type, but this does not seem to be the case. He may have even converted me to his side...I've been blasted for saying similar things. We cannot be angry that spying itself exists. That will never change and there will always be spies.We can be angry at the immense overreach of the NSA, not the fact that the NSA exists.

It's not just an unprecedented number of journalists who are getting the book thrown at them-- prosecutions of whistleblowers are through the roof, too. The worst part of all of this is that by embracing end extending George W Bush's surveilance policies, Obama has helped cement them as a bipartisan issue. Sure, you'll have individual politicians stand up and pontificate about government overreach, but the leadership in both parties are depressingly on-board with it all.

The notion of a detailed Permanent Record is something that has never been contemplated by the vast majority if people, and is never discussed in the mainstream press.The public is blasé about privacy in general precisely because they have not thought at all about the unknowable future of their data. Most people haven't been inconvenienced or had a problem that they know of *yet*, so they figure everything must be totally fine. Plus, The Grownups say it's fine.I can only imagine the uproar if a law was passed requiring everyone to regularly turn over all their contacts and phone records to the government so they could keep track of all communications and associations. Would people object to such a law because it would be an outrageous violation of their personal sovereignty, or because it would require them to actually think about what was happening? The fact that in real life this happens in the background makes it ok though....

Would people object to such a law because it would be an outrageous violation of their personal sovereignty, or because it would require them to actually think about what was happening? The fact that in real life this happens in the background makes it ok though....I think this is quite interesting. Compare the scenario of someone writing a personal email, and suddenly notice a complete stranger standing right beside her, watching and reading what she writes over her shoulder.I would haphazard a guess that most people would react quite strongly.While, when the same happens, but is done very far away, by an anonymous person/system, it produces a much smaller emotional effect.I think this is a common thread in human psychology, and I think you can see the same thing in the reactions to the famous “Trolley” problem, and the “Fat Man”, i.e. we are neurologically wired to react strongly emotionally to certain situations involving other individuals in close contact. These emotional reactions can “short-circuit” our logical higher order functions, that in turn can lead to contradictory and illogical behaviours and decisions in many modern day situations.The emotional reaction to someone reading over your shoulder is quite probably a self-defence reaction to (among other things) “spying/eavesdropping”, which in turn is probably as old as our species. That defence mechanism is now in practice circumvented or made impotent, by doing the “eavesdropping” remotely.The failure to react is therefore a failure of our paleolithic brains, to keep up with our technological advances, and we probably require some “help”, either throught “education” or to reconceptualise what is happening, to properly reengage our emotional personal defence systems._____________________edit: clarification

All the Snowden cheerleaders saying "rah rah go" to every word he utters and picking and choosing which parts of the constitution they want to obey while ignoring what they don't should reflect on what exactly everyone doing the same thing would mean to society.So do you have a problem with all forms of civil disobedience? After all, everyone who engages in the practice is setting themselves up as the ultimate arbiter of what is a just or unjust law, and their cheerleaders go rah rah.Quote:If Snowdon gets to ignore the courts & established law "because I'm doing it for the public good" then so must everyone else. Cops get to ignore the parts of the constitution that slow them down, the courts do the same, etc. Only the black helicopter crowd believes that this is already true.Right, everyone should only obey those laws they deem just and refuse to obey those that violate their conscience, preferably non-violently.Also, what you are ignoring is what philosophers and ethicists call moral dilemmas. Suppose you have a duty to do A, and a duty to do B. But doing A means you can't do B, and doing B means you can't do A. Now you have a dilemma. You must choose to do one or the other. This is the choice Snowden faced.He swore an oath to the constitution (as he understood it when he swore that oath) and he swore an oath not to share classified documents. But the problem is that he was placed in a situation where they contradicted each other from his perspective and he had to pick one. Some would prefer he chose to uphold his oath to secrecy, I happen to think his oath to the constitution trumps and supersedes his oath to secrecy, so he made the right choice.

Snowden is extremely articulate; he is able to say the things and ideals that I'd wish to communicate, but he is so much more eloquent.

Breaking a law prohibiting disclosure of classified materials does NOT - repeat after me NOT - break the Constitution.

Breaking a law prohibiting disclosure of classified materials does NOT - repeat after me NOT - break the Constitution.It's also worth noting that Snowden was not a government employee. He was a contractor, and as such not protected under the Whistleblower Protection act. He broke a law in disclosing classified materials, but that is not the same thing as a police officer or judge disregarding the law because he is not employed by the government. This gave him very few approved ways to get the word about these programs to the public legally. He could still have been fired, had his clearance revoked, and, going by others who have come before him, potentially been put in a mental facility against his will or imprisoned if he had tried to take the legal route.

They’re good people trying to do the right thing, and I can tell you from personal experience that they were worried about the same things I was.Good people don't spy on you "for your own good", let alone without even a real reason to do so. Good people don't criminalize and jail people for questioning the right of those same "good people" to illegally detain, eavesdrop, and gather intelligence into activities that have nothing to do with the country involved.You might say "how then will they know"? Yes, indeed. Why not disrupt the privacy of several billion to catch the few who "might" be doing something questionable...

hero or traitorit all dependsIF what the fed is doing is eventually held to be unconstitutional, he is a hero until then he should avoid the embassy 4th of July partiesI can think of one government setback by the supreme court over whistle blowingit can be found in dirks vs sec [surprisingly from 1984]clipped from WikipediaIn 1984, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the case of Dirks v. SEC... that... Since Dirks disclosed the information to expose a fraud, rather than for personal gain, nobody was liable for insider trading violations in his case.
