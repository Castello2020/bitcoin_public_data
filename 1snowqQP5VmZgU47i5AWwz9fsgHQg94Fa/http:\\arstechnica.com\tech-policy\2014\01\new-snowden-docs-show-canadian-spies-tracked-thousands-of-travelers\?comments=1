NSA leaks
New Snowden leak: Of 160,000 intercepted messages, only 10% from official targets

According to newly published documents, Canadian spies tracked thousands of travelers online for days after they left an unnamed Canadian airport.
This revelation, gleaned from 2012 slides (PDF) provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden, shows that the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC) conducted a real-world test that began with a “single seed Wi-Fi IP address” from an “international airport” and assembled a “set of user IDs seen on network address over two weeks.”
The technique appears to be related to one outlined by University of California San Diego and Microsoft researchers in a 2010 research paper (PDF).
It seems that CSEC used this technique to conduct a real-world test of data analysis across a "modest size city" to look for a fake "kidnapper" making ransom calls. CSEC's conclusion was that while the technique was "successful experimentally," it was "too slow to allow for practical productization."
The authority then switched to something called the "Collaborative Analytics Research Environment," described as a "big-data system being trialed at CSEC (with NSA launch assist)."
And its conclusion? "A new needle-in-a-haystack analytic is viable: contact chaining across air gaps. Enabled by sweep capability of IP profiling. Should test further to understand robustness with respect to loosening assumption of target behaviour. Beyond kidnapping, tradecraft could also be used for any target that makes occasional forays into other cities/regions."
“Repeat to cover whole world”
The documents do not describe exactly what the “user ID” precisely is. But computer security researchers believe that it could either be persistent tracking cookies, or another unique identifier—such as an e-mail login—that would be consistently transmitted in the clear.
The documents do say that “two weeks worth of ID-IP data [came] from Canadian Special Source.” The precise name of that source is redacted in the version published by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).
Then, the CSEC “follow[ed] IDs backward and forward in recent time,” tracking them to “local hotels, domestic airports, local transportation hubs, local Internet cafés,” as well as “other international airports, domestic airports, major international hotels.”
CSEC concluded: “Can then take seeds from these airports and repeat to cover whole world.”
Why would spy agencies want this? “Analytic can hop-sweep through IP address space to identify set of IP addresses for hotels and airports, detecting target presence within set will trigger an urgent alert.”
In a statement on its website, CSEC maintained that it is:
[L]egally authorized to collect and analyze metadata. In simple terms, metadata is technical information used to route communications, and not the contents of a communication.
The classified document in question is a technical presentation between specialists exploring mathematical models built on everyday scenarios to identify and locate foreign terrorist threats. The unauthorized disclosure of tradecraft puts our techniques at risk of being less effective when addressing threats to Canada and Canadians.
It is important to note that no Canadian or foreign travellers were tracked. No Canadian communications were, or are, targeted, collected or used. And all CSE activities include measures to protect the privacy of Canadians.
Ron Deibert, one of Canada's top technical experts and the director of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, wrote in The Globe and Mail:
What’s this mean for Canadians? When you go to the airport and flip open your phone to get your flight status, the government could have a record. When you check into your hotel and log on to the Internet, there’s another data point that could be collected. When you surf the Web at the local cafe hotspot, the spies could be watching. Even if you’re just going about your usual routine at your place of work, they may be following your communications trail.
Enlarge CBC
“Particularly clever”
Nicholas Weaver, a computer security researcher at the International Computer Science Institute based in Berkeley, California, speculated that CSEC could have collected the relevant data in one of two ways.
“The real interesting thing is not the analysis of the data—a lot of people could do this,” he told Ars. “The question is: how did they acquire the raw data for the analysis? They likely acquired the raw data in one of two ways. One, wiretapping close to the analytics side and pulling the side off the wire, which is easy to do. Or two, they simply acquired the data from somebody who’s already collecting. It could be purchased just as easily as it could be compelled.”
For example, he said, an analytics firm could have handed over a data set including unique tracking cookies (such as the UTMA cookie that Google uses) and IP addresses, as well as dates and times. Then, the spies could have followed that cookie as it popped up again when that computer or mobile device logged onto a different network at a different time.
Using the bulk data itself enables the spies to determine which IP addresses correspond to different fixed locations, such as other airports, hotels, cafés and businesses. While public Internet searches sometimes turn up associations between known IP addresses and known locations, that information is often wrong. The goal of this new CSEC technique appears to provide much higher reliability and trustworthiness of this type of data linking movements to locations.
“What the question is: given this [unique ID] as a raw data input, what can you infer about the usage about IP addresses scattered throughout the world?” he said. “You have an existing database from IP geolocation data, but you want to know what role this IP address has. That’s why this is particularly clever.”
Christopher Parsons, a fellow at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, a group that helped review the documents, added that while using corporate analytics may have been one possible attack vector, there could have been another.
“There’s a series of different kinds of identifiers—that’s not entirely clear from the documents,” he told Ars.
“It’s also theoretically possible that [CSEC] may be tapping into other identifiers. There’s going to be some global database that they’re pulling from. Whether it’s going to be cookies or another identifier. My thought would be [if not cookies] that if they’re looking for particular chat user names or e-mail that is also sent in clear or sent in clear often enough. One of [the] pieces about this [is] that it seems to indicate that it’s the act of logging on. It’s not clear that you have to make some particular action, it’s that the device[s] are likely to be sending out this kind of information upstream. It is possible that it’s your username every time you hit the mail server.”
He also noted that in Canada, the two major ISPs—Bell and Rogers—provide, by default, e-mail accounts on Microsoft and Yahoo, respectively.
So, he speculated, if CSEC was going to use such an e-mail username for instance, “that ISP is going to have a litany of personal information about a Canadian target, billing and everything else that they hold, whereas the cookie information may not provide [all that information.]”
Both Parsons and Weaver also added that the use of Tor, VPNs, and anti-tracking software (such as browser plugins like Disconnect or Ghostery) may help to somewhat thwart this type of tracking.
“This is one of the most pernicious things on the Web, is that the Web is built on tracking,” Weaver observed. “As I like to say: ‘Facebook likes your taste in porn.’ The like button tracks the pages you read. It’s not even anonymous tracking but explicit. Web tracking is a serious problem because it enables all sorts of evil stuff. Basically the NSA and company are leveraging that infrastructure.”

While it is possible for this type of capability to be used for the wrong reasons (tracking of your own citizens, political dissidents, etc), this is the type of thing I would expect governments to rehearse on a regular basis. A kidnapper calling in ransom demands is a perfect example of why you would want them to be well practiced.But again, there's always the chance of this capability being used against someone's personal enemies that requires significant oversight as a prerequisite.

Given the massive fact that corrupt governments from the Five Eyes have, for decades, generated revenue channeling tax payer's trillions of U$S to establish a surveillance apparatus & a secret pseudo-legal framework (just as a last resort in case someone is crazy or altruistic enough to alert the common people of the world) to justify their own unconstitutional/illegal enterprise? If, and only if, that qualifies as a fair distinction of opposites, which any decent person of the world knows it's NOT, I don't doubt for a second who I would give my money to. Now, let me ask you this Innocent question, on the same level of your reasoning: how much do you estimate world news organizations should charge per document released JUST to get even with what the Military Intelligence Industrial Complex has made? Let me answer that for you: I don't think they can make that much money even if they sell every single document at 1 billion dollars each. OK, enough with kinder garden reasoning, moving on...

Just the other day, I heard an interview on the radio with somebody from Turnstyle (a Canadian company), which sells technology to stores that gave them the ability to do the same thing to their customers. According to him, they were going to be able to track customers in the store, but where they went after they left the store. An article I found about this:http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technolo ... e16327257/

It's not unusual for a trial of this type to have a defense cost in the millions. So if there's a trial, then this is a drop in the bucket.

Can Snowden just hurry up and release documents showing that pretty much every developed country spies on its own people in some nefarious manner, and illegally at that?I feel like at this point he has enough documents to do so. Going through country-by-country is just going to unnecessarily paint some countries as more evil as others when we apparently all do the same thing.But I guess at that point it would be less "The US/NSA spies on everyone, they're evil!" and more "Well, we all spy on everyone else, so I guess we're good here."Status quo?

I feel a little better about having my phone not auto-login to wifi networks. A lot of times I'll stay on cell data even when "free wifi" is available, because I feel that (citizen hacker) eavesdropping on cell towers is less likely than on an open wireless access point.Of course, what I just wrote does not protect me in the least from a sophisticated agency attack. The best I can do is keep the VPN turned on, on my phone as well as my laptop, but along with the limited protection that might give, that just makes me look more suspicious next to all the other ordinary Joes.foreignreign wrote:Can Snowden just hurry up and release documents showing that pretty much every developed country spies on its own people in some nefarious manner, and illegally at that?That can just be assumed. We can be up in arms about our own government doing it, and yet, it may be safe to assume that the Chinese and the Russians etc. also do it and while possibly caring much less about civil liberties.Basically, once the data are out there, no government (or corporation or organized crime organization) is going to resist the use of those methods and resources. The only thing that is required is sufficiently high stakes as defined by the organization.

This is precisely how I want my tax money spent. Csec provides assistance to other agencies too and assume their full authority while in that role. So if I understand their website correctly, if they're acting on rcmp behalf or csis behalf, then whatever laws and rules that apply to that agency apply to the agents on said case. But with additional oversight.I feel that the chances of being unfairly targeted by Csec or law enforcement is much less possible than being targeted by crooks (terrorists, thief's, everyday swindlers, etc) so I'm ok with this. I just wonder how much money this is indeed costing and if the price matches the accomplishments (which we may never know)Edit: rcmp not ramp; csis not chis (autocorrect strikes again)

This sounds to me like a one-time thing to test whether a particular method works in real life. It's vastly different than the constant and methodical blanket surveillance practiced by NSA.

I've started to become uneasy with the Snowden releases of late. This article discusses a fairly logical test CSEC would perform, which, the article admits could have been performed using data gathered in-the-clear. If you don't think this sort of data gathering is ethical, then you have a much bigger problem, as this is what every ad-network company has the ability to do.At the start, the Snowden docs revealed things were clear breaches of privacy. I feel like we're starting to run out of those sorts of revelations and are now getting into things that are more issues of procedure. Procedures which CSEC might be legitimate in claiming should be kept secret, or at least gives them more weight. (Although, of course, security through obscurity is no security at all.)

At last I can call my representatives about spyingIn regards in data gathering in the clear, the idea is that the government is held to higher standards. Section 8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms states that we are all to be free from "unreasonable search or seizure". This constitutes as search as the SCC determined in Hunter v Southam that any action by the state that infringes on a person/entities privacy is a search. The thing that can save this search from being illegal 1. if there is a law authorizing it and the law is saved by Section 1 [Oakes test] (purpose has to be justifiable in a free and democratic society and means used is proportional [harm caused is less than good that arises]). In any case I wish for the SCC to take this up. And of course we need oversight on things like this.On a case by case basis the courts can allow this to happen but only general save for spying is the above.

Stickmansam wrote:At last I can call my representatives about spyingIn regards in data gathering in the clear, the idea is that the government is held to higher standards. Section 8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms states that we are all to be free from "unreasonable search or seizure". This constitutes as search as the SCC determined in Hunter v Southam that any action by the state that infringes on a person/entities privacy is a search. The thing that can save this search from being illegal 1. if there is a law authorizing it and the law is saved by Section 1 [Oakes test] (purpose has to be justifiable in a free and democratic society and means used is proportional [harm caused is less than good that arises]). In any case I wish for the SCC to take this up. And of course we need oversight on things like this.On a case by case basis the courts can allow this to happen but only general save for spying is the above.That's great if they're trying to spy on Canadians but they're not supposed to do that...(i'm not sure where the charter of rights and freedoms of non citizens stands, you?) which makes one wonder how they can know they didn't target Canadians while performing these tests? Or is this a sneaky way of still gathering data on Canadian citizens bit not 'targeting' them ? The Csec website seems to clear any doubts there by specifically saying so if I recall correctly as well as clearly saying they can't ask other agencies in allied countries to do spying on Canadians on the right behalf (i.e. Hey nsa, we can't spy on joe here but we'd suuuure appreciate if u could do a little snooping? Got a tub of maple syrup here...we'll just leave it here and if anyone takes it we won't ask questions!)

Not sure if this has been mentioned yet, but the "unnamed airport" in question is YVR Vancouver International Airport according to local radio news this morning.

Wow, the leak tells the whole world, "Look, Canada is doing it too, not just the U.S. They are worst than the U.S.""Nice move."What we have learned from this article. This is not just about the spies or kidnappers being tracked down by the government, it also suggesting us that this is how the police tracking down on their targets. Criminals or not criminals and that's how the police does it. Learning something new, right?When you are a target for whatever reasons there are, when you are traveling oversea, whenever and wherever you logon to your email, chat rooms, forums with your usernames. The police knows your locations, your hotel, your guesthouse, the mall you are at. Local police will be notified by the Homeland, FBI, state, county that's for sure.This is not new news, but still, many of us don't know about this police tactics and they are thinking once they are oversea, they are in the clear. They are not.The police want to know the IDs and the MAC address on your laptop, tablet, smartphone the second you bought them from the store.The police knows you are going oversea. Your very best friend one day came to you and say to you he has a brand new tablet he bought over the Internet. It is still in the original box and has never been opened, and now he doesn't want it any more. He wants to make $20 dollar over what he paid for and he wants to sell it to you with a huge discount. Yeah, it is about $150 less what you would pay at a local store. Good deal, right? Yeah, a great deal you wouldn't want to pass out.Well, now you know why. :-)The device has all kinda buggers installed. A GPS tracking. An all time on voice recorder recording every single conversation you have. The webcam is secretly turned on but you don't know it is on. etc..Sneaky, sneaky, sneaky..

Those claims much remind me of the concept behind nuclear deterrence.Just persist in saying that you can monitor each and every electronic device and eventually everyone will believe you. Every then and now pull a trick to baffle the public which underpins your alleged power and prowess.In light of all of those revelations would any serious villain really resort to using any electronic device well aware the fact that he can get tracked so easily ?E. Snowden is the protagonist of the largest ploy ever to trick the public into believing that NSA is kinda Saurons evil eye perceiving even the most minuscule detail. Surprisingly Sauron's eye didn't perceive the Ring even if it was so close to him until it was too late.

I am curious about something from the article. It is quoted that neither Canadians nor foreign travelers were tracked. If they didn't track Canadians, and, they didn't track foreigners, who did they track?

Snowden's released info shows that CSEC was involved in the development of WARRIOR PRIDE including "high precision GEO TRACKER SMURF". All they would have to do is get the phones to download a Free WIFI page for the airport wifi which included code to download the WARRIOR PRIDE software.

If there is a wifi network that I wouldn't trust for privacy, it would be one at an airport. I mean, after all, they are run by the government. Even without tracking cookies, that can just sniff your MAC. We haven't seen this yet, but I'm waiting for the day when Starbucks reveals they were asked by the government to share wifi MAC harvests.

Speaking as a Canadian, no one ever suspects the Canadian, in fact, all countries love us. Anyway, maybe CSIS will get a budget increase over this media exposure.

...and nobody cares. Anyone with the most basic technical ability knows this shit has been going on forever. The rest of the general public is clueless even when you plaster it to their face, they shrug their shoulders and just keep on using 12345 as their password.So unless Snowden is going to start coughing up the Little Green Men UFO files, he should just release everything and be done with it and just leave it be.
