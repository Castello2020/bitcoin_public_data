<a name="features"></a><h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>emulation of the GameBoy, GameBoy Color, and Super Gameboy</li>
<li>accurate emulation of the hardware, based on research with lots of test roms, useful for debugging/rom development. some highlights:
<ul>
<li>clock exact timing of LCD behavior/state changes</li>
<li>realistic initial ram values - random but with specific bit patterns, and simulated values left by bootroms (for example "nibbler (pd)" depends on this)</li>
<li>accurate emulation of LCD register writes during scanline (prehistorik man, demotronic demo)</li>
<li>emulation of inaccessible VRAM and OAM as on real hardware</li>
<li>10 sprites per line limit</li>
<li>clock exact emulation of sprites causing mode 3 to take longer</li>
<li>correct memory access timing (access happening at the last/second to last clock of an opcode)</li>
<li>accurate emulation of the differences between DMG and GBC, including timing differences, differences in hardware behavior, initial state, etc.</li>
<li>can run a GBC rom as on a DMG, and a DMG rom as on a GBC</li>
</ul></li>

<li>powerful debugger:
<ul>
<li>disassembler</li>
<li>assembler (change code and ability to save modified rom)</li>
<li>symbols (SYM file) support</li>
<li>"inline" editing in code, data, and stack viewer</li>
<li>breakpoints</li>

<li>singlestepping/tracing/animating/step out/step over</li>
<li>vram viewer: BG map, tiles, OAM, palette.</li>
<li>IO registers viewer</li>
<li>live display of data during emulation and freezing of ram values</li>
<li>break on exceptions (accessing inaccessible VRAM, read unitialized RAM, echo ram access, access locked external ram, disable lcd outside vblank)</li>
<li>ability to modify all registers and state at any time</li>
<li>joypad window allows simulating button presses at any time while debugging</li>
</ul></li>
<li>SGB multiplayer with up to 4 gamepads</li>
