"Your mind is your predicament." – Socrates
Public Domain Day
I normally try not to post more than once a day…and indeed until recently I’ve not been posting on an even monthly basis. However, that is changing this year, at least that is one of my resoltuions.
And as quickly as I have set a new resolution for 2010, I am working on an exception. And, of all days, January 1st, 2010 is the rule breaker: here is something that I believe is worth posting about today: Public Domain Day.
You see, while most people in the world are celebrating the start of the new year, there are otehrs that are looking at and even celebrating the expansion of the Public Domain that happens on the first day of every year. Or, in some cases, lamenting the expansion of the Public Domain that didn’t occurr because of the changes to the Copyright laws that have happend.
Confused? Well, you needn’t be… here’s a few quick references to explain the whole story. First, here is the story of Why The Public Domain Matters, from the Duke University Center for the Study of the Public Domain. Next up is The Incredible Shrinking Public Domain story, also from Duke University.
Next, it’s on to the observance of Public Domain Day. Duke University leads off with: Public Domain Day: January 1, 2010. We then move to Creative Commons for: Public Domain Day 2010 and Beyond. And we have personal observations from Thomas (cmdln) Gideon and James Boyle.
But, what observation of Public Domain Day would not be complete without examining What Could Have Been Entering the Public Domain on January 1, 2010?
There you have it, my official Public Domain Day observation, for better and for worse. Let’s just hope that we don’t have to until 2049 for the things that should have been in the Public Domain this year.
