So, I had about Â£600/$1000 in mtgox when it went down.</p>
<p>I had been trying to withdraw my money for months but they were just delaying and making excuses on approving my account to prevent just that. In the end I lost everything.</p>

<p>So I built myself a clever clock.<br />
One I never need to set, even during Daylight savings.<br />
One that monitors the temperature and lets me remotely log it.</p>
<p>This is the clock to end all clocks. I will never need another one <img src="http://www.pyrofersprojects.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  </p>

				<small>February 1st, 2013 <!-- by Pyrofer --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://www.pyrofersprojects.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo.jpg"><img src="http://www.pyrofersprojects.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-e1359750120749.jpg" alt="SpyroOnPortal" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-398" /></a><br />
Ok, so I finally caved in and  bought some Skylanders stuff cheap on ebay. I got a second hand Portal and game for the 3DS (for my son, honest). Now, it didn&#8217;t come with figures but the save games had 2 figures cached so we can still play.<br />
Looking for figures I found the start set figures were pretty much nowhere to be found, so to get them I bought a PC starter pack, with Portal and Game.<br />
Now I don&#8217;t want to play it on the PC and will probably resell the PC game, but out of interest (before the PC one arrived) I bought just the Wii game with no portal and no figures, just a disk.<br />
The 3DS portal with USB cable WORKS with the Wii version! I have yet to try the PC portal on the Wii but as that has USB it should work too, plus it holds more figures.</p>
<p>So, it looks like for compatibility the 3DS portal is best, working with the PC, the Wii and the 3DS (maybe xbox/ps3 too?). However it only holds one figure because it&#8217;s smaller.</p>
<p>Turns out the system used is a standard ISO RFID so lots of RFID cards trigger the portal, obviously they don&#8217;t read as figures but its funny to see your oyster card trigger the Portal of power as if you put a figure there.</p>
<p>So, My figures arrive and I play. For no reason one of them corrupts.<br />
I have NO idea how to fix this in the Wii version I am playing, but luckily I have the 3DS version and DO know how to fix it in that.<br />
I place the figure in the portal and the 3DS offers to reset it, I do so and it &#8220;works&#8221;.<br />
Sure enough, the Wii recognises it too.<br />
Worried by this I decide to backup all the figures right away, The first two backup no problem but the figure I &#8220;fixed&#8221; will not backup and gives errors.</p>
<p>Is it possible the Figure is damaged? The Wii/3DS still read it but the PC won&#8217;t back it up. Very strange.</p>

I built a quad-copter (That&#8217;s for another post!) and bought a cheap chinese 6 channel TX.</p>
<p>It sucks (The TX that is).</p>
<p>I built my own TX from scratch using a 2.4ghz plugin RF module designed for converting 35mghz transmitters into 2.4ghz versions.</p>
<p>The base of the TX is a PS2 pad, the vibration motors were removed and the control chip desoldered. An AVR was installed in one of the &#8220;arms&#8221; of the pad where the motor was removed from.</p>
<p>The two sticks were connected directly to ADC0-ADC3 on the AVR.<br />
It turns out the pad had &#8220;analogue&#8221; buttons and these were not good enough to trigger the digital inputs on the AVR. The solution was to fit 4 small micro-buttons behind the shoulder triggers to provide a good action. The top buttons were ignored.<br />
These 4 buttons trigger the &#8220;aux&#8221; channels, sending a value around 1500 when off and 2000 when pressed. This allows me to trigger options on my quad.</p>
<p>To power the whole thing a small 500mah 3.7 lipo was fitted inside the radio TX module and a 3v to 5v step up adaptor fitted inside the pad. A lipo charger with mini-USB connector was fitted near the old cable outlet.<br />
The LiPo charger outputs 100ma, so 5 hours to fully charge the battery, while the step up converter is capable of 500ma max, so 1 hours maximum run time.<br />
I have yet to do a test to see how long it works in actual usage, but I expect more like 2 hours+ in normal use.</p>
<p>The code to generate the ppm signal is from an open source project called <a href="https://github.com/wertarbyte/funkenschlag/" title="Funkenschlag" target="_blank">Funkenschlag</a> by a friend from IRC.</p>

				<small>July 22nd, 2011 <!-- by Pyrofer --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><div id="attachment_350" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.pyrofersprojects.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Power-Monitor.jpg"><img src="http://www.pyrofersprojects.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Power-Monitor.jpg" alt="Power Monitor" title="Power Monitor" width="320" height="240" class="size-full wp-image-350" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Power Monitor</p></div><br />
<br />
So, after google killed the Google PowerMeter api I got the incentive to finish my own project using it. Odd huh.<br />
I wrote loads of code to hook into the google API ages ago, but never got the hardware setup. Now After Google announce the death of the API I finally cracked the last part of my hardware issues and have live power monitoring of my electricity meter.</p>
<p>The key difference to most here is that its NOT a clamp type sensor. It counts rotations of the meter disc itself. It is therefor accurate and matches exactly what I will be charged for.</p>
<p>There are three parts,<br />
1> Pic (UBW board) with IR reflectance sensor<br />
2> Moxa Serial to Ethernet convertor<br />
3> Database server</p>
<p>The Pic board counts rotations of the disc in 1 minute increments. Every ten minutes it connects to the server over serial (to ethernet UDP) and uploads all ten readings<br />
The server saves these into a mysql database.<br />
I wrote some PHP code to generate graphs of various data, this is proving to be the hardest part. Getting the data to look good. </p>
<p><div id="attachment_353" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.pyrofersprojects.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/power-use.png"><img src="http://www.pyrofersprojects.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/power-use.png" alt="Power Use" title="Power Use" width="320" height="240" class="size-full wp-image-353" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Power Use</p></div><br />
Please excuse the awfull graph but I shrank it to make it fit nicely in the blog post, in the full version you get it nicely labelled and some extra info like average KW/h and total KW/h for the time period selected.<br />
The biggest problem is the jaggedy graph, this is a side effect of the fact I count rotations per minute. Rather than time each rotation. Because the average rpm is low I only get about 1 rotation each 30 seconds. So its very easy to get a reading of 1 followed by 2 by 1 by 2 etc as that second rotation moves slightly back and forth over the 60 second boundry.<br />
I am looking at ways to smooth this out without distorting the data too much.</p>
<p>I used the PIC UBW board because the USB port allowed me to compile code and program the pic in <30 seconds without unplugging anything. The serial to ethernet converter remained connected to the serial port so my development cycle was quite fast for the PIC code.<br />
I did some simple software debounce of the IR sensor (just in case) but it doesn&#8217;t seem to be needed.<br />
The end result is completely non-invasive to the meter (yes, in the pic you can also see my OWL clip on sensor, this is not part of the new system and only runs a small LCD by my PC).<br />
The next step is to find a sensor that will trigger from the gas meter and allow me to monitor that too. They are close together so the hope is I can use another input on the same PIC and upload both sets of readings at the same time.</p>
<p>This graph has allowed me to identify individual appliances by time and watch their power use, with a little more detailed study I will eventualy work out the power profile for each device and possibly predict when each one is turned on and off purely from the graph data! I can spot my fridge, my oven and washing machine already.</p>

Sony recently went the way of Nintendo in trying to ban âmodchipsâ from sale. With a degree of success from both companies coming from the fact that the modchip had little âlegalâ use, despite arguments about homebrew and backups.</p>
<p>PSGroove was just released. Its source code for the new PS3 Hack. Out in the open. But what does it run on? Wonât the âmodchipâ get banned?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It runs on an existing development platform that has been selling thousands without any use for &#8216;hacking&#8217; as Sony see it.</p>
<p>Sold at many large companies such as Digi-key and RS this device has VERY clear legitimate use and has a huge market before the PSGroove code was released. </p>
<p>How can Sony ban this item? That would be about as likely as getting cricket bats banned because somebody found you could hit people with them. Itâs just not going to happen.<br />
This finally brings to a head my point about modchips from the start, they are just simple microprocessors on a PCB. Most of the older ones were on generic PCBs and had to be hand soldered. If sold with NO code installed, how can it break any law or get banned?</p>
<p>Its like trying to ban wires because they can be used to make bombs. </p>
<p>I canât wait to see what happens when Sony tell Atmel and Microchip to stop making components, or tell Digi-key and RS to stop selling components. It just wonât happen. It Canât happen. If it does, the world is beyond saving.</p>
<p>The device in question is the Atmel<br />
<a href="http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?site=us&#038;lang=en&#038;mpart=AT90USBKEY2">USB Key</a>. How exactly do they plan to fight this?</p>

I have been heavily interested in 3D, be it watching or creating. Taking two photos and joining them together for 3D is ok, but you can&#8217;t photograph anything moving or take video that way.<br />
My solution was to create this complex arrangement of mirrors. The final image is split into two, with the left and right images being shown top to top.<br />
Using this I can take video, such as thsi<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itgoeMk2l-w">3D Test</a><br />
The process is complex as I have to convert my video from the cameras native format back to mpeg2 for use in Stereo Movie Maker then save it out as a calibrated left/right video.</p>

Ok, so summer is over here in England (argh) and I got some dark, the Eye Cam is taken down while I do some actual astro Photography.<br />
I got lucky and had a clear night during full moon and took this. I hope to get some more images soon, but I live in a city so there is quite a lot of light polution as well as cloud.</p>

I will publish the results, and amount won shortly after notifiying the winner via my website. I do not collect email details via the app, so it will be up to the winner to check the site after March!<br />
If nobody claims within 28 days the prize will fall to the second person, and so on until it is claimed.<br />
The prize will not be given if any cheating, hacking or manipulation of results or the app itself is discovered.<br />
Please check the high score charts at <a href="http://www.pyrofersprojects.com/fingersports">The FingerSports Site</a> to see progress.<br />
Only scores submitted between now and the end of March qualify. Should this promotion be a success I will repeat the prize for the following month, counting only scores entered during that month.<br />
I will update with more details shortly.</p>
<p>I hope to run a prize fund total on the site showing the current expected prize fund.</p>
