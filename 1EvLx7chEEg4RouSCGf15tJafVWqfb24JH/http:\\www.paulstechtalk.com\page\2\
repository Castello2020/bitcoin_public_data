<h3>Why it happens!</h3>
<p>It sometimes isn&#8217;t clear about why but <a href="https://neosmart.net/wiki/startup-repair-infinite-loop/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">some people have theories about it</a>.   The main theory that I would like to talk about is the registry of Windows 7.   I have played around windows my whole life and know a thing or two about registry hacks and other such tweaks to do what is necessary to an operating system to get it to work.  I had a friend bring me a laptop that had this such problem.   It would just get a point in the boot up of Windows 7 and restart.   I never saw the windows screen or anything like that.   I am going to have to say it was probably an improper shut down of the operating system, or the hard drive got bumped because this was a laptop.   It is bound to happen for any laptop you have any laptop because most people do not know about preventing the hard drive from getting bumped.   You can always <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/359631/how-to-command-disk-park-using-laptop-with-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">park the hard drive</a>, which is rarely used today time.   I do remember having to do that in the 90&#8242;s and some of the early 2000&#8242;s but that was just nothing we&#8217;ve forgotten about.</p>
<h3>OEM Recovery Partition</h3>
<p>Since my friend was using an Acer Laptop, I used the recovery option included in all Acer laptops!</p>
<ol>
<li>Acer =  ALT + F10</li>
<li>Toshiba = F8  (repair your computer)</li>
<li>Dell = F11 (Some laptops have to do a manual installation of Windows)</li>
<li>Lenovo = F11</li>
</ol>
<p>These are only for of several manufacturers of Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and thus there are several that I am sure I have missed that have a recovery partition that you can use to recover you system in <strong>case of an emergency</strong>!</p>
<h3>The Need for a Backup?</h3>
<p>I have done <a href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/2013/12/what-is-backup-really-worth-to-you-top-5-backup-software/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">post after post</a> about backing up your data but in this case.   My friend just didn&#8217;t think about the need to keep those photos and important documents backed up!  I think I finally convinced him to look into backing up those important files.</p>
<h3>How I did it!</h3>
<p>The nice thing about recovery of important files is that I can use something like Kubuntu to use a live Demo of the operating system to gain access to the hard drive to put all those files on a [easyazon_link asin="B005MNGQ6C" locale="US" new_window="yes" nofollow="yes" tag="paulstechtalk-20"]Transcend 1 TB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive &#8211; Military Drop Standards (TS1TSJ25M3)[/easyazon_link] and then wipe the system and use the recovery option to install windows brand new.</p>
<h3>Extra problems!</h3>
<p>Strangely enough when I finally got the first start-up screen for Windows 7, it said</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Windows could not complete the installation. To install Windows on this computer, restart the installation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I was thinking there was some disk error that did not get fixed on the re-installation of Windows 7.   So like a lot of computer savvy people, I found an article to bypass installation of windows and do it manually by going to the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/windows-could-not-complete-the-installation-to/bf09c3c5-298b-459f-aed5-4f431b8398f5?page=2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">oobe.exe and running it directly</a>!  Once I created a new account and rebooted it worked like a charm and I was able to login and upgrade the rest of the system like normally.   You might experience a driver that wasn&#8217;t downloaded and you will have to go fetch that driver from either Microsoft or from the vendor in question.   After all that, I was very pleased that it wasn&#8217;t going to be a hard repair and it was actually a simple repair other than making sure the important files was saved for my client!</p>

			<h3>So you ha<img class="alignleft wp-image-2142" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.paulstechtalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/41en96KC1tL._SL160_.jpg?resize=215%2C287" alt="41en96KC1tL._SL160_" data-recalc-dims="1" />ve the RCA A1!</h3>
<p>When I first got this phone, You wouldn&#8217;t believe just how in experience I was with the <a title="How To Get the RCA A1 4.7″ (unlocked)  to Work with Straight Talk" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/2014/04/how-to-get-the-rca-a1-4-7-unlocked-to-work-with-straight-talk/">RCA A1</a> on Straight Talk.  I didn&#8217;t know half the stuff I know now with this phone.  I am going to share with you what I&#8217;ve learned and what You will want to do or may NEED to do to have a better experience than I did when I started using this phone.</p>
<p>If your like me, <a title="6 Android applications I installed on the RCA A1 Unlocked Phone!" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/2014/05/6-android-applications-i-installed-on-the-rca-a1-unlocked-phone/">you may have some Apps</a> that you automatically install when you get your phone.  Then again you may just want to keep it simple and use it as it.  You may even just want to have it <a title="How to setup predictive Text on the RCA A1 Unlocked Phone!" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/2014/05/how-to-setup-predictive-text-on-the-rca-a1-unlocked-phone/">predict your typing patterns</a>!  These are all just a few programs you can install on this phone but before you do you may want to do these steps to insure you use the most out of the 4gb of storage in the phone.</p>
<h3>Fixing the Storage Problem!</h3>
<p>If your like me and you just thought it would all go the 2 gb space on the phone, but later found out it didn&#8217;t here is how you fix that.  You should check out t<a href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/tag/rca/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">he other articles on the subject</a> that might help you understand what I&#8217;m about to talk about.</p>
<p>To fix the storage problem:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Settings &gt; Storage &gt; Preferred Install Locations </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Select Phone Storage</strong> (it has 2gb Space)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Default Write Disk:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Select <strong>Phone Storage</strong> if you DO NOT have an <strong>SD CARD inserted</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So know you have at least 2GB of space to use to install apps.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Securing the Phone!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You have several options on this one.   If you have a reason to keep it secure this one is the most under used but need to pay close attention to.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Settings &gt; Security</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once your got to this screen you will want to decide just how much to secure your phone whether it be to encrypt the phone fully or just to have a pattern, pin or password lock for your phone every time you need to unlock it.   I really do not support the Face Unlock feature of the phone because I find it to be very buggy but it might be an option for you!  It however comes with a price, your face features could be taken from the phone and for other devices.  It is always going to be stored on the phone.`  I suggest either a PIN or Password but that is just me.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Display</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Settings &gt; Display</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Brightness  (<strong>Check Automatic Brightness</strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Theme</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(<strong>4 Different Themes</strong>) Default, Mint, Mocha, and Raspberry</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I selected <strong>Mint</strong>.  It makes it more personal!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Update your phone:</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Wireless Update</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You should do this over Wi-Fi but it is up to you.   The current one as of this posting is MT77.ALPS.ICS2.MP.V1.18.   I have found out is an AMD processor chip for this phone and that they it is a Dual core.   So that is nice!  I will post more important information later on!  If this post has helped you please consider saying thanks by using my <a title="Affiliate Link" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/amazon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon Affiliate link &#8211; http://www.paulstechtalk.com/amazon</a>.   It cost you nothing but a small portion of the sales from what you buy with this will help me support my blog!</p>

<p>This was the first one that I installed on my new <a title="Comparing the Samsung Galaxy III to The RCA A1 Unlocked Phone!" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/2014/05/comparing-the-samsung-galaxy-iii-to-the-rca-a1-unlocked-phone/" target="_blank">RCA A1 Unlocked Phone</a>.  It wasn&#8217;t exactly a let&#8217;s think about this.   I have said in the past about <a title="Lastpass still the best there is!" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/2011/05/lastpass-still-the-best-there-is/" target="_blank">Lastpass</a> and I have bought the premium membership which only cost <strong>12$ a year</strong> to be able to use it with my phone.</p>

<h3>Google Authenticator</h3>
<p>Since I have <a title="Playing around with Google Authenticator and the 2 step process!" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/2013/04/playing-around-with-google-authenticator-and-the-2-step-process-2/" target="_blank">2 factor authentication</a> enabled on all sites including Google.   I need to be able to get access to the authenticator to be able to gain access to those sites which need the app.</p>

<h3><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.weather.Weather" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weather Channel App</a></h3>
<p>I know this one isn&#8217;t really one that everyone uses but I like to keep track of emergency conditions and this will take away some of the <a title="How To Get the RCA A1 4.7″ (unlocked)  to Work with Straight Talk" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/2014/04/how-to-get-the-rca-a1-4-7-unlocked-to-work-with-straight-talk/" target="_blank">3 gb softcap for Straight talk</a>.  It is however worth it.</p>

<h3><a title="Podkicker Pro" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.podkicker" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Podkicker Pro</a></h3>
<p>I bought this app two years ago and it has been valuable for me.   I get to listen to <a title="Intro to Podcasting Part 1" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/2011/04/intro-to-podcasting-part-1/" target="_blank">my favorite podcast on the go</a>.   I can go to a free wifi hotspot and quickly and easily just download the podcast that are most important to me.   It can be very good because you can specify which locations you want the podcasts to be stored at.   I put them on my external SD card and that saves me space on my internal space.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2297" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.paulstechtalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Google_Wallet.png?resize=178%2C198" alt="Google_Wallet" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h3><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google Wallet</a></h3>
<p>Even though this Phone doesn&#8217;t have NFC capabilities, I like to have this app for the loyalty programs that I might come across and not have to find those silly cards that you get build up in your wallet.   This app is good at keeping track of those and if your go into a store with a loyalty program, your phone will be ready to pull up the scan bar that is related to that store.   Very useful for those of us who are trying to save money.</p>

<h3><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gbis.gbandroid" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gasbuddy</a></h3>
<p>Yes this one is also very good at saving your money around town.   I use this when I am looking to get the most out of the gas prices in my local community and helps me get the lowest possible price on gas.   This has been a life saver for me, I once found gas for dirt cheap because of an attendant.   That day that gas station had to eat the cost!</p>

<h3 data-wpview-pad="1">Predictive Text!</h3>
<p>So I had someone sent me question on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PaulsTechTalk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Facebook page about setting up predictive Text</a> for my <a title="I am going to review the RCA A1 4.7″ 3G Unlocked Dual SIM Phone from RCAmobile!" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/2014/04/i-am-going-to-review-the-rca-a1-4-7-3g-unlocked-dual-sim-phone-from-rcamobile/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RCA A1 Unlocked Phone</a>!  I thought this was a good question for those who really aren&#8217;t good at settings on the phone.</p>
<h3 data-wpview-pad="1">Settings!</h3>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t been using the phone yet, it is a good time to know how to navigate and get into the settings menu!   You have 3 good options that I know of and I will talk about them in detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pull down menu &#8212; if you ever need to get to the settings menu, you can swipe down the pull down menu and then hit the settings button!    It is sometimes Black and White or color but it always look the same!</li>
<li>The Two Bar Button &#8212; Hit the two bar button on your RCA A1 Phone and then selecting System Settings</li>
<li>Into the Apps Window &#8212; Go into the Application window and look for the settings app which should look like a gear!   Once you figure out how you are going to get into the settings menu you are almost there.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Enabling Predictive Text!</h3>
<p>The next step requires you to be in the settings menu.   Once there you will need to go and select:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Language &amp; Input &gt; Android Keyboard (Settings Button) &gt; Auto Correction then Show Correction Suggestions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once you have done that your predictive Text as you type it will start learning from the common words you type and will start to show them over the next few weeks.   Although I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Swiftkey</a> (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey.phone.trial" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Free Version here</a>) to do that because it works like a charm and learns quicker and easier!  I honestly do not have to worry about predictive text with Swiftkey.   It has always been one of the many apps that I install on any given Android phone or tablet I have bought in the past.</p>

<h3>The Battle Rages on!</h3>
<blockquote><p>While they probably do, compared to Google, I would assume it would be minimal. Apple doesn&#8217;t have financial incentives to collect data. Googles bread and butter involve the collection of big data. (Edited to fix type mistakes)</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Joey Okazaki &#8212;  A Friend on Facebook!</strong></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">My friend likes the Apple Iphone and Ipads because he feels safe.   I&#8217;ve talked about the <a title="Apple Needs to Worry about Security and Virus!" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/2011/05/apple-needs-to-worry-about-security-and-virus/">security implications of assuming</a> it is secure, in the past!  Yet because they aren&#8217;t worried about security, they have <a title="Apple get scammed out of 9,000 Ipods" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/2009/03/apple-get-scammed-out-of-9000-ipods/">lost money getting scammed by scammers</a>!   Each of these cases are unique to how Apple has operated in the past.   Far be it for me to point out just how much they have not thought about security because they believe <a title="Apple Needs to Worry about Security and Virus!" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/2011/05/apple-needs-to-worry-about-security-and-virus/" target="_blank">Security through Obscurity</a> is going to keep them safe.  This article is a basic comparison article both Apple and Google.   In the end it is your decision which one you will want to go to.   I like the Google Android because of the openness of the Operating system.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Apple&#8217;s Closed Mindedness!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Even though I usually speak harshly of Apple, I tend to do that because <a href="http://www.jaygeiger.com/index.php/2010/01/26/apple-is-the-most-closed-minded-company/" target="_blank">Apple to me is so closed minded</a>.   I thought it was a good way to talk about some of the things that people assume about Apple.   While some of these are going to be rotten apples, others  will leave a sour taste in your mouth about Apple.   Although I will say that Google doesn&#8217;t come out smelling like a rose either.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/02/21/apple-acquires-app-testing-and-advertising-company-burstly" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apple buys Burstly</a> and they now have a reason to collect that data!  Although this isn&#8217;t news to some others have not been paying attention.  I know Some bugs in the wild that have yet to be fixed.   The <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/06/technology/security/apple-email-bug/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">email vulnerability in Iphone</a> can be quite worrisome and troubling.  I&#8217;m sure I can find even more problems with the Iphone and Apple products but just because they <a href="http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2014/05/new-class-action-lawsuit-filed-against-apple-concerns-android-phones-imessage.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">do not allow openness than you will have people getting mad</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Apps on the IOS!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Although, I have yet to talk about the apps.   In order to get your app on the Apple store, you will need to have a Macintosh computer for one.   It however is the hardest hurdle for some but that isn&#8217;t the only thing.   You can&#8217;t expect to have your app in the Apple store if it violates the <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Terms of Service from Apple</a> is quite freighting to say the least but at least I know what is collected from me on my android device!  When you install an app on the Google android device it tells you before you install it and sometimes when you first run it what the terms of service are for that app!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Google is Open Sourced!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you&#8217;re looking to <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">develop for Google</a>, you can have any machine you pick.   From Windows, Mac, or Linux!   You can choose the way to develop that game and bring it into the android universe.   It however doesn&#8217;t come without some problems in the past and current!  With the <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-tips.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">security features that Android</a> has you are less likely to see a problem!  Some problems I have heard about lately are quite serious such as the <a href="https://bgr.com/2014/04/23/android-apps-heartbleed-bug/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Heartbleed problem in Android</a>!   Can leak serious personal information from users and could get your personal information.   I am sure however this will be fixed in the coming weeks and that we should not worry too much about such things that we can not control.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m biased!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I know I really do not like Apple because of how they think and want people to think they are more secure.   I am sure it can be assumed that the Apple fanboys think the same thing with the Android devices claiming they are less secure but no device is truly ever secured and if you assume Apple isn&#8217;t collecting your information that you are sadly blindly trusting them.   I&#8217;ve learned my lessons from Apple in the past and I still recommend Android to all my friends and family when ever they ask me for my opinion.   I know where  I stand with Google but I do not know where I stand with Apple and thus I do not readily recommend them for that one reason!</p>

<p>For the most part, child locks are a good way to keep kids safe but the one thing most people do not know is <a title="Best Tips and Tricks for your ZTE AWE!" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/?p=2095" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Reseting the android device</a> is probably the easiest thing you can do to get rid of them.  Here are a few Child Lock apps that would be gone if you did that!</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="A safer, yet Fun, and Totally Free phone experience for kids! AVG Family Center offers a kid safe zone (mode) that places your children’s favorite apps and games in one place. With our easy to use parental controls, you can child-lock your phone, keeping your kids and your phone in safe mode which prevents deleted texts, accidental ad clicks and expensive in-app purchases." href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avg.family" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kid Safe + Child Lock</a></li>
<li><a title="Tired of your kid messing with your phone settings, deleting things and opening apps you would rather not have them open? This is the app for you. Create your own app launcher screen for your kid with only the apps you want them to play. The home and back keys are disabled and a user settable pin code is needed to exit the app. This app will also enable you to conveniently keep all your child's apps in one place." href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.babyturtleapps.childlock" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Child Lock Lite</a></li>
<li><a title="Rated the #2 Family App by Time Magazine, Famigo provides parental safety controls that turn smartphones and tablets into safe, educational, mobile playgrounds for kids. " href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.famigo.sandbox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Famigo Child Safety Lock</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve only named off a few because when your child gets to that certain age of wanting more they will figure out ways and this way is the easiest to get the device back to factory settings without much effort from them.</p>
<h3>Hide Pictures!</h3>
<p>With android, anytime you have a photo or picture on your phone.   Android will index and put in into the gallery.   Well sometimes you really do not want  your mom see them and a few good apps to do that for you such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Hide Pictures ,Videos, Applications, Messages , Calls in your phone. COMPLETELY FREE and UNLIMITED version." href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smartanuj.hideitpro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hide It Pro</a></li>
<li><a title="ncrypt File Free can encrypt and protect photos, videos, audios, pictures, doc, ppt, xls, pdf and other files using a password." href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acr.encryptfilefree" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Encrypt Files</a></li>
<li><a title="MobiSafeFile is a powerful file encryption software. With Encrypt Files you can protect your files and folders from unauthorized viewing." href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trustmobi.mobisafefile" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MobiSafeFile</a></li>
<li><a title="Selected pictures vanish from your photo gallery, and stay locked behind an easy-to-use PIN pad. With KeepSafe, only you can see your hidden pictures. Privacy made easy! " href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kii.safe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hide Pictures</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see those videos, Files, or even text messages that you do not want anyone to see can be easily encrypted to prevent anyone such as your mom from seeing.   It also helps keep your privacy safe because do yo really want people to know you have a naked female picture on your phone!</p>
<h3>Quickly call a favorite!</h3>
<p>If your like me you have several people you call on a daily or even sometimes more than twice a day.   You do not want to go through the contacts to call them.   You can easily and simply put an icon on your home screen and every time you tap it, and you&#8217;d be calling them.   This however can be dangerous because of the possible hit dial while in your pocket so take not and maybe put it off one or two screens from the home menu just to be safe.</p>
<p>With Some older version you simply have to find a blank space on the page and just do a long press hold to have it come up to say <strong>Shortcuts &gt; Contacts</strong> but with newer version.  You just have to go into the <strong>Widget screen and hold the contacts icon</strong> and it will make a contact shortcut.   You can do that with both calling and texting.   It is a really quick way to text to someone without having to type in their name or number.   This is the best thing to swiss cheese.   I love it!</p>
<p>As you can see these are just a few that will get your mom upset with you.   You can also us a <a title="Reviewing VPN4ALL and why you should care!" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/2013/07/reviewing-vpn4all-and-why-you-should-care/">VPN to help keep parental eyes</a> off what your doing online, but it cost money and I am sure it is something you will have to consider when your at McDonald, Starbucks, Chick-Fil-a, and the library.   You really should use a VPN when possible but that is just my opinion!</p>

<h3>The Big Story!</h3>
<p>A few weeks or I should say at least 2 months ago, I had Google give me the infamous warning about &#8220;<a title="Google shoots my site in the foot!  (Unnatural outbound links)" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/?p=2113" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Unnatural outbound links</a>&#8221; and I finally <a title="Why I switched back to WordPress from Squarespace!" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/?p=2163" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">had it with Squarespace</a>.   I was pretty much fed up with not supporting Squarespace 5 anymore and since they didn&#8217;t have way to easily upgrade to 6 and of course Google.  I took the leap to going back to WordPress.  I had great success with <a title="WordPress Security Tips — For the untrained :" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/?p=402" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WordPress in the past</a>.  I knew I wanted WordPress but I really didn&#8217;t want to go back to those hosting providers that gave me the hardest time to cancel my account like Justhost and Hostgator.  I am sure I&#8217;ve missed one or two but those two were the worst with payment methods and hidden fees.</p>
<h3>Cheaper than SquareSpace!</h3>
<p>I paid $71.40 for a whole year with <a href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/Bluehostdotcom" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bluehost</a>.   Which is far better than Squarespace, which was easily 120$ a year if you bought them over a year at the premium level and I do not remember the exact amount for the basic level which was 10$ a month.  I should say I am really impressed with the ease of buying the hosting and updating my DNS to go here.  It was almost effortless but it was a hard decision non the less!</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/Bluehostdotcom"><img class="alignright" src="http://i2.wp.com/img.bluehost.com/300x250/bh_300x250_01.gif?resize=300%2C250" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Domain Verification!</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/Bluehostdotcom" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bluehost </a>verifies the domain by calling you and going through even more hoops to make sure the domain belongs to you.  It was a pleasant surprise when that week someone called me to verify that the domain that I used to set up was actually mine.   It can help thwart thieves and people from taking control of your domain without your knowledge.   So this verification was really nice to know it was there.   I am sure they didn&#8217;t have to call me and verify it but it was a nice change.</p>
<h3>Increase in Ad Revenue!</h3>
<p>The most important reason for me, was the simplest one.   It was the need to be able to do what I want with the themes and to change it as I see fit.   I can do what I want to my blog and not have to be constrained by no one or nothing.   I thought it was a great benefit with Squarespace but I found out that I couldn&#8217;t do as much or earn as much.   I&#8217;ve noticed that when I came back to WordPress.   I started earning more from Amazon and Adsense.   Like I was held back by Squarespace.  I do not know this for sure but I am glad I went back to WordPress.</p>
<p>I dare you to try <a href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/Bluehostdotcom" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bluehost</a> and give them a try because you&#8217;d be amazed as much as I was when I started the process.</p>

<p>The Phone comes in several different speeds but this seems to be the average hardware for the phone itself.   As you can see this is a quite a speedy and quite nice.   Although I have not had a Samsung Galaxy, I have though had friends let me borrow theirs for a day or two to play around with it.  I like it if I could afford to buy one, you&#8217;d bet I would jump on it like wildfire.</p>
<h3>RCA A1  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H2FXSKK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00H2FXSKK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=paulstechtalk-20&amp;linkId=BIC5YVOT37SOF77X" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon.com</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="http://rcamobilephone.com/#specifications"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2229" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.paulstechtalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screenshot-2014-05-04-at-2.20.28-PM.png?resize=270%2C211" alt="Screenshot 2014-05-04 at 2.20.28 PM" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>To the best of my ability, I searched and searched for the which chip set this phone was using and I just couldn&#8217;t find any information on the phone or online.   If I would have to guess it would be a dual core (<strong>See picture</strong>) low powered Arm Chip set.  It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me on that one but I do not know.  I do not know how long it will be available.   I am sure Samsung will be making problems for RCA in the coming months, if not sooner.  It however is really nice for the lower price, but you shouldn&#8217;t expect to much from this phone.</p>
<h3>A quick review!</h3>
<p>So I have it, for almost a whole week and I&#8217;m really enjoying it.   I can now tether without any troubles.  I even talked about how to get the phone to <a title="How To Get the RCA A1 4.7″ (unlocked)  to Work with Straight Talk" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/?p=2188" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">work with Straight Talk</a>.   It seems to be working wonderfully and the SMS seems to be work once you put in the RIGHT APNS for the phone.</p>
<p>Some of the things that I have found with this phone is quite simple.   You do not have any notification lights on the phone.   So you do not know until you turn the screen on if you missed a call.  It seems to be a problem to some and others like me really do not care because I hardly ever get a phone call.   So it might hinder some of you from buying this phone.   I bought this phone for the size of the screen and that it looks like the Samsung Galaxy S3 to a point.   I for some strange reason can&#8217;t install Netflix on this phone but I might have done something to cause this.   I&#8217;ll explore more and let people know if it is a major problem or if it is just me!</p>
<p>Here is what I think so far.   The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H2FXSKK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00H2FXSKK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=paulstechtalk-20&amp;linkId=FAAL5FJILFM3AQNG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RCA A1</a> is a Good phone for those who are looking for the size and the look of the S3 but you&#8217;d be cutting the price because you will not get as many good feature or speed.   The speed on the phone is really not bad compared to ones that I have used in the past.  It will vary from person to person on how they like the phone but it is a GOOD phone for the price of the phone and being able to use it with Straight Talk.  I am personally liking the phone now and will encourage anyone to at least try it out and see for yourself!</p>

			<h3>Anyone want to drink that Kool-Aid?</h3>
<p>When <a href="https://www.grc.com/revocation.htm" target="_blank">Steve Gibson first started talking about revocation</a>, I never knew it would be such a hot topic right now.   Then he decided his next thing <a href="https://www.grc.com/revocation/crlsets.htm" target="_blank">he needs to do is talk a bout the CRL&#8217;s </a>(<em><strong>Chromium Browser or Chrome</strong></em>).   Now before we get into the problem at hand, we first have to understand what CRL&#8217;s (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Chrome Revocation List&#8217;s</strong></em></span>) are and how they deal with Chrome.   I think Steve did a fantastic job at discussion it but we probably are not done with the subject.   The <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/04/29/revocationagain.html">Adam Langley decided he needed to talk about what Steve posted</a>.   I guess he felt like he was being attacked but he also said stuff that purely got me thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;"><em>“Since we&#8217;re pushing a list of revoked certificates anyway, we would like to invite CAs to contribute their revoked certificates (CRLs) to the list. We have to be mindful of size, but the vast majority of revocations happen for purely administrative reasons and can be excluded. So, if we can get the details of the more important revocations, we can improve user security. Our criteria for including revocations are:</em></p>
<ol style="color: #000000;">
<li><em>The CRL must be crawlable: we must be able to fetch it over HTTP and robots.txt must not exclude GoogleBot.</em></li>
<li><em>The CRL must be valid by RFC 5280 and none of the serial numbers may be negative.</em></li>
<li><em>CRLs that cover EV certificates are taken in preference, while still considering point (4).</em></li>
<li><em>CRLs that include revocation reasons can be filtered to take less space and are preferred.”</em></li>
</ol>

<h3>Breaking down that statement!</h3>
<p>I figured this is all about details and we should have a little fun and read between the lines.   The first thing that jumps out at me is that the CRLSet&#8217;s must not get to big, I&#8217;m guessing it has to do with size and they probably are trying to keep it under a certain amount of space.   I can only guess it would be close to 10 megabytes but that is just a guess.  It isn&#8217;t unconventional to say the least but it would be phenomenal if it was better than the revocation checks.</p>
<p>So the Second thing that really makes my eyes pop out is that it can not be encrypted?  Which means that if it can not be encrypted then we have a man in the middle attack possible where someone could almost prevent Google from telling browser that a site has revoked their certificates.   It is highly unlikely but someone could come along and snatch that CRL before it gets to the browser and easily change it to prevent you from knowing any the wiser.  Which means it is a <a title="A guest post I talked about MITM?" href="http://www.javamazon.com/what-is-a-vpn-and-how-it-works/" target="_blank">MITM (Man in The Middle Attack)</a> although it is highly unlikely I am going to have to say it is possible!   I can not understand the concept of this.   You can have bots go to sites that are 100% HTTPS and not have any problems.   I am amazed and quite concerned that it has to be HTTP and HTTPS.   So it begs the question about why he thinks this is an ideal situation.</p>
<p>I could go on about just that list but I better get to my other points</p>
<h3>Soft-Fail revocation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;"><em>And yet, GRC managed to write pages (including cartoons!) exposing the fact that it doesn&#8217;t cover many revocations and attacking Chrome for it.</em></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><em>They also claim that soft-fail revocation checking is effective:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure, I&#8217;ve talked about <a title="Adam Langley, You are dead to rights wrong.  Why you should enable SSL revocation checks!" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/?p=2184" target="_blank">soft-fail revocation</a> the last few weeks but I am not the only one who has talk about this.   Steve has talked about it in depth on his site also.  He seems to think that it will not help and it is not effective but I find that the CRLSet is also very ineffective and should be avoided at all cost.   I though did like the cartoons that Steve or I should say <a href="https://www.grc.com/revocation/crlsets.htm" target="_blank">GRC posted</a> about the CRLSets and what that means to you!</p>
<h3>Revocation is still KEY!</h3>
<p>Even though I believe revocation is the heart of the problem, it is still the best we have.   I think it will go out the window in the next few years and something better will come but until then we have to come up with a best way to trust that if the certificate is revoked we can know that it isn&#8217;t being used.  This is where OCSP  Stapling comes into play.  We can cut out most problems and attacks if we do not allow the connection to refuse a certificate look up.   I can&#8217;t seem to come up with any other way.  Again if you haven&#8217;t enabled <a title="Why you should check your SSL settings!" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/?p=2176" target="_blank">SSL revocation check</a>, it is time to fix that in Chrome.</p>

			<h3>The Low Down!</h3>
<p>If your like me, and you have bought the Unlocked <a title="I am going to review the RCA A1 4.7″ 3G Unlocked Dual SIM Phone from RCAmobile!" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/?p=2170" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RCA A1 4.7&#8243; Smartphone</a> and you need to use <a href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/go/StraightTalk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Straight Talk</a> (<strong>Affiliate Link</strong>).   Then you&#8217;ve come to the right place.   I&#8217;m going to tell you how I got it to do send and receive Multimedia Messages Services (MMS), Voice, and Data.  If your like me, this should be &#8220;a walk in the park&#8221; but I&#8217;ve heard some people say they couldn&#8217;t get it to work with Straight Talk.   I&#8217;m here to help transition you to the service easier.  First off, you will need the <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com?id=1736X924838&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.straighttalk.com%2Fwps%2Fportal%2Fhome%2Fshop%2Fsims%23.U17lcuhX-uY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AT&amp;T Compatable Straight Talk Sim Card</a> (<strong>Affiliate Link</strong>)!   I will be doing more down the road.</p>
<h3>If No Sim found Message</h3>
<p>First off after you get your SIM card installed and you turn on the phone you get the dreaded no SIM card found then you will need to do some things.  First off pull the back off and see if your SIM, is placed, in the right way in either SIM 1 Slot or SIM 2 Slot.   You should notice that the Sim should have the cut facing the battery and it needs to be in the Lower Right hand corner!  Once you have placed the SIM correctly in the Phone, reboot the phone and it should bring up saying it has found the SIM!</p>
<h3>Access Point Names and Activation!</h3>
<p>If you have not activated the sim by going to <a href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/go/StraightTalk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Straight Talk</a> (<strong>Affiliate Link</strong>), you will need to do that now.   Once you&#8217;ve activated the SIM, you can now turn on the phone and let it boot up.  Access Point Names (<em><strong>APN&#8217;s</strong></em>) are used to tell the phone how it should communicate with the Cell Towers.  If done right the Phone will work on all AT&amp;T Cell Towers with no problems.  I&#8217;m going to walk you through the process and help you get your new phone to work with Straight Talk.</p>
<p>Go into <strong>SETTINGS  </strong>(Either through the APP itself, or by pressing <em>the book with 2 lines</em> (To the left of the button) and selecting <strong>System Settings</strong>!)</p>
<p>Select  ( <strong>More&#8230;</strong> ) then <strong>Mobile Networks</strong> and Finally <strong>Access Point Names</strong>.</p>
<p>Once there, you should see one already been made by Straight Talk &amp; AT&amp;T it should be called (<strong>Cingular 410</strong>) already selected and used!</p>
<p>You will need to create a new APN by pressing the book with 2 lines and selecting <strong>NEW APN</strong>.</p>
<p>Once Done here you should add these to the new APN.   Do not add more or less and make sure you spell everything correctly or this may not work properly for you!</p>
<p>Name:   <strong>STRAIGHT_TALK</strong></p>
<p><strong>APN</strong>:  <em>tfdata</em></p>
<p><strong>APN type</strong>: d<em>efault, MMS, supl</em> (Only select those three.   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do not select WAP</span> or it will not work)</p>
<p><strong>MMSC</strong>:  <em>http://mms-tf.net</em></p>
<p><strong>MMS proxy</strong>: <i>mms3.tracfone.com</i></p>
<p><b><i>MMS Port</i></b><i>: </i>80</p>
<p><strong><em>MCC:</em> </strong>310</p>
<p><strong>MNC</strong>: <em>410</em></p>
<p>Save these settings by hitting that book with 2 lines on it and selecting Save.</p>
<h3>All Set!</h3>
<p>Once Done you should have two APNS.   Now select the  STRAIGHT_TALK apn and reboot your phone.   If you have done it right the phone should now have a H right above the 4 bars and you should now have both data and MMS working.   I have used MMS and it working just fine with the phone.   I can send and receive movies, pictures, and even sound recordings.   It worked with my old phone wonderfully, the <a href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/home/2014/3/9/first-impressions-of-the-lg-optimus-f3-4g-lte-by-virgin-mobi.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LG Optimus 3</a>.   If you&#8217;re looking for even more help with Straight Talk, you should check out <a title="How to get the most out of Straight Talk phones (Tips and Tricks)" href="http://www.paulstechtalk.com/?p=666" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">my other blog posts about them</a>!</p>
