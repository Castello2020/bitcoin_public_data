By Guest<br />Sunday, June 26, 2011<br /><br /><a href="http://pastebin.com/Wvr098Kt"><span style="font-style: italic;">http://pastebin.com/Wvr098Kt</span> </a><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"><br />Editor's Note: The following post </span><span style="font-style: italic;">provides an excellent summary of why it may be counterproductive to seek legal recognition for bitcoin.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> It </span><span style="font-style: italic;">was written by an anonymous guest in response to an article published on TorrentFreak, but</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> it is unclear why the comment does not appear in the article's comments section.</span><br /><br />This piece, <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/the-red-flag-act-of-1865-110626/">"The Red Flag Act of 1865"</a>, concludes with the lines: <blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">"The moral of the story is that an industry troubled by technological advances should neither be allowed special laws nor be confused with the public interest, but instead be permitted to die as swiftly as possible, so that new industries and new jobs can take its place."</span></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Actually, that isn't the moral of the story at all.<br /><br />The moral of the story is that the State is the enemy of progress, and that companies use the State to stifle progress and harm society, and we should not let this happen ever again.<br /><br />We must not allow the State to interfere in the new business models surrounding the abundance created by the digital revolution. We must not allow the state to cripple or destroy the monetary revolution that Bitcoin represents.<br /><br />We must not allow or accept any legislation to do with copyright or Bitcoin, and where such legislation exists, we should all actively ignore it.<br /><br />We have to realise that at the root of the Red Flag Act of 1865, the patents that stifled the development of the steam engine, the Sony Bono Copyright Extension Act, ACTA, HADOPI, the myriad 'Three Strikes' copyright acts and all other society harming acts that are drafted at the behest and by the hand of industry, all are given power by a single fact: the existence and violence of the State.<br /><br />If you keep begging to the state for your freedom, you will never get it. If you join the state and try and change it from the inside, you might spend your entire life trying to do it, will probably fail, and in the meantime the harm to society and people would be of an incalculable size. The proof of this is the incessant torrent of new laws like the The Red Flag Act of 1865 that are put onto the books every year.<br /><br />Everyone on earth has an interest in this and must wake up and face the facts squarely. The State is the cause of all of our problems. Rather than each of us complaining about our own separate issues one at at time (gays and marriage, drug users and prohibition, file leeches and copyright, Libertarians and money) we should all group together at one time with our axes to cut down the root cause of everyone's problems: The State.<br /><br />The State impacts everyone, hurts everyone and makes human life a misery. The State murders, steals, distorts and destroys. It is our common enemy, and we must all fight it together, no matter who we are or what our particular complaint is.<br /><br />There are some things we need to bear in mind, that we absolutely must not do.<br /><br />You cannot on the one hand, be for the ending of the State interference in your particular area of interest, and also be for it controlling other people. This is irrational, immoral, and it is the main way that the State manages to continue to exist. Everyone everywhere has a reason to prop up the existence of the State, because they want other people to obey some law or regulation. This is a fundamental problem that has to be addressed, and the final part of the puzzle and awakening that will finally put pay to the State.<br /><br />Stop begging for your freedom with pointless demonstrations, marches, protests and letter writing to the State. If you want your Liberty, you must simply take it. Accept Bitcoin in payment for goods. Copy whatever you want, whenever you want. Marry who you want. Smoke marijuana. Gamble online. Do whatever you want to do that the state forbids you from doing, as long as no one is hurt by what you do.<br /><br />As we have seen with the insane and catastrophic failure of the 'War on Drugs', the state cannot stop anyone from doing what they want. They can only pick off a few people here and there to make an example of. The real power of the state is FEAR (False Evidence Appearing Real).<br /><br />You need to tell everyone you know that our true enemy is the State, and make them understand the big picture. All we need is all the productive people to stop cooperating with the State for it to suffer a death blow.<br /><br />We can live in a much better, prosperous, peaceful and productive world if we abandon the State. If you are tired of all the wars, the banker bailouts, the insane laws, the prohibition, the discrimination, the police brutality, rising prices, banning of herbal medicines and everything good for you and that is your right, you need to give up on the idea of the State. You need to stop financing it, stop going to it for help, stop reciting its propaganda, folklore, lies and nonsense.<br /><br />I know that what I have just written is difficult to swallow for many. I understand that many of you are frightened of the idea of the death of the State. All I can say to you is this; the vastly superior world that will quickly emerge after the State dies will be enough to change your mind and wash away your fear forever.<br /><br />The status quo should be unacceptable to everyone now, since everyone is being negatively impacted by the State. Everyone's life is touched by the poison of the state, and as the economic crisis continues to bite, the State will become increasingly desperate to hang on to power. Just look at Greece for an indication of what they will do once they are challenged; the Greek state outlawed cash transactions and put their thugs onto the street. Which brings us back to how to destroy them; marching in the street will only get you assaulted or shot. We all need to withdraw consent and money at the same time, and that is all we need to do. The State survives on our consent and money. Stop them both, and it will have no one to physically attack with its batons and tear gas. It will simply shrivel up and die like the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of OZ.<br /><br />If you liked this article, send Bitcoins to this address:<br /><br />1CscbhR4nn8SVyHJtg1yFcKA73xBk5NfCx

By Jon Matonis<br />
<br />
Why are some prominent libertarians and even Austrian economists coming out against bitcoin? To be fair, it's not all but some. The concept of bitcoin can be difficult to grasp at first and even more difficult to explain. Economists from the 19th and mid-20th centuries can be forgiven for not anticipating an interconnected digital realm like the Internet with its p2p distributed architecture, but modern economists cannot be. In <a href="http://www.libertariannews.org/2011/06/06/libertarian-goldbugs-hating-on-bitcoin-free-market-money/">"Libertarian Goldbugs Hating on Bitcoin"</a>, Michael Suede observed:<br />
<blockquote>
"I feel I have a pretty damn good grasp of Austrian economic theory and  its core tenants.  Thus, it was incredibly surprising to me when I set  about visiting numerous libertarian forums to discuss the new  peer-to-peer currency called <a href="http://www.libertariannews.org/2011/05/31/how-to-use-bitcoin-the-most-important-creation-in-the-history-of-man/" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> and was met with wide ranging hostility."</blockquote>
Most libertarians  have a deep bias towards gold and precious metals as  the perfect money because it has withstood the test of time and,  although it can be debased and manipulated by the monetary overlords, it cannot be fabricated at  will. Therefore, their criticisms of bitcoin stem from  two general themes: (1) it has no intrinsic value like gold; and (2) it fails to  satisfy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_Money_and_Credit">Mises' regression theorem</a> of primary use value prior to becoming money. For more detail on Carl Menger, the origin of money, and the Ludwig von Mises regression theorem, see Robert Murphy's <a href="http://mises.org/daily/1333">"The Origin of Money and Its Value"</a>. Let's review some specific comments from noted libertarians and then focus on the two primary criticisms in turn.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">David Kramer</span><br />
<br />
First out of the gate was David Kramer, who wrote <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/blog/lewrw/archives/89471.html">"Bitcoin: Just Another Bogus Medium of Exchange"</a> in which he provides a non-cryptographic analysis of bitcoin lacking material use/value and then mistakenly proceeds to compare bitcoin to the ill-fated and centralised e-gold. This diatribe was then re-posted at the <a href="http://blog.mises.org/17249/ideological-and-irrational-exuberance/" style="font-style: italic;">Mises Economics Blog</a> where it received over 100 comments.<br />
<br />
I have to give credit to Robert Wenzel at <span style="font-style: italic;">EconomicPolicyJournal.com</span> who quickly challenged Kramer's piece with <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/06/bitcoins-real-money-or-bogus.html">"Bitcoins Real Money or Bogus?"</a> and remains a "fascinated bystander that can not rule out, based on Austrian theory, the possibility of a  future electronic money that is not created by governments or that had  any prior use value other than having perhaps an interim period as a  receipt for a currency or commodity."<br />
<br />
Kramer was then refuted by the very libertarian <span style="font-style: italic;">Libérale et libertaire</span> blog with <a href="http://rulingclass.wordpress.com/2011/06/10/money-is-what-the-free-market-says-it-is/">"Money is what the Free Market says it is"</a> which had this to say about the regression theorem:<br />
<blockquote>
"Lastly, one more note about 'convention.' The 'Misean Regression  Theorem,' which establishes Gold as a convention, based on a regression  series for a demand for money that can be traced back to a barter  economy where gold emerged as a medium of exchange, also can be viewed  as a progression series terminating in totalitarian fiat currency  abolishing gold as a medium of exchange. And the the only thing that can  undermine this state of affairs is something that likely arises out of a  21st century digital barter economy. Conventions are just that,  conventions&#8230;they should never be mistaken for universal principles."</blockquote>
Citing a lack of technical comprehension and an ignorance of public-key cryptography, Kramer was also repudiated by <span style="font-style: italic;">Blogdial</span> in <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=3064">"Refuting the attacks on Bitcoin&#8217;s design"</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
"When you have even a slight grasp of how data and computers work, and  you understand that the double spending problem has been solved, your  first reaction would be to gasp, as the enormity of what Bitcoin is  dawns on you."</blockquote>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Peter Schiff</span><br />
<br />
With such a vested interest in gold and the precious metals market, one could expect Peter Schiff to prefer gold as money but gold and bitcoin do not have to be mutually exclusive. Schiff took to the airwaves with a <a href="http://youtu.be/vTr_hTC90oQ">radio discussion</a> on bitcoin with Donald Norman from the London-based Bitcoin Consultancy in what is mainly an audio version of the "no-intrinsic-value" argument.<br />
<br />
Schiff's argument is rebutted <a href="http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=13467.0">here</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/i7ydq/peter_schiff_talks_bitcoin/">here</a>. Expect to hear more from him in the future.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Doug Casey</span><br />
<br />
Personally, I think Doug Casey will realize the potential of bitcoin before Peter Schiff does, but in the meantime Casey's current bitcoin thoughts are summed up in this recent interview with Louis James, <a href="http://lewrockwell.com/casey/casey89.1.html">"Doug                Casey on Bitcoin and Currencies"</a>. After commenting on all of the positive attributes of bitcoin, Casey answered the value question:<br />
<span style="font-size: 100%;"><b></b></span><br />
<blockquote>
<span style="font-size: 100%;"><b>Louis:</b> Do                they have value in themselves?</span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 100%;">             </span><br />
<div style="font-family: georgia;">
<span style="font-size: 100%;"><b>Doug:</b>                There&#8217;s the rub; I don&#8217;t see that they do. Bitcoins are                just an electronic abstraction. They can&#8217;t be used for anything                else, nor are they made of something that can be used for anything                else. They are like one of those knots in a string that disappear                if you pull hard enough on the ends of the string. They are not                backed by anything at all. Like government fiat currencies, they                are a con game, functioning only as long as people have confidence                in them, regardless of whether that confidence is well placed or                not.</span></div>
<span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 100%;">             </span><br />
<div style="font-family: georgia;">
<span style="font-size: 100%;">I&#8217;ve always                said that the dollar is an &#8220;I owe you nothing,&#8221; and that                the euro is a &#8220;Who owes you nothing.&#8221; With Bitcoins &#8211;                which no individual can be held accountable for and which have no                value in themselves &#8211; I&#8217;d have to say they are a &#8220;No                one owes you anything.&#8221; It was inevitable, therefore, that                the scheme would collapse&#8230; at least in its present form.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div style="font-family: georgia;">
<span style="font-size: 100%;"></span></div>
<span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 100%;">And so it is that our prominent gold and monetary freedom advocates come down against bitcoin. Focusing on Casey's incorrect GoldMoney statement that we already have something like bitcoin, yet backed by a precious metal, <span style="font-style: italic;">Blogdial</span> embarrasses the libertarian with</span> the sarcastic <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=3103">"Bitcoins backed by gold launched "</a>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Blogdial</span> states:<br />
<h2 id="post-3103">
 </h2>
<span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 100%;"></span><br />
<blockquote>
"This service is as far from Bitcoin as you could possibly be. There  is no software to download, you cannot buy and sell it from anywhere  without restriction, you have to integrate with the state at a very  intimate level, indeed, they cannot even offer this service to everyone,  even Europeans like the Dutch, thanks to the State.<br />
I would never put my money into a service like this where the State  is alerted of all your details and 'holdings'. They offer no utility  whatsoever in comparison with Bitcoin. You cannot spend your GoldMoney  at retailers directly, you can only redeem your stored gold for cash,  which you then have to either take in person or spend through another  intermediary if you want to buy something from Bangalore. And of course,  there are the myriad fees and taxes you have to pay each time you move  YOUR MONEY around between these entities."</blockquote>
Michael Suede also refuted Casey in <a href="http://www.libertariannews.org/2011/06/23/the-economics-of-bitcoin-doug-casey-gets-it-wrong/">"The Economics Of Bitcoin &#8211; Doug Casey Gets It Wrong</a><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 100%;"><a href="http://www.libertariannews.org/2011/06/23/the-economics-of-bitcoin-doug-casey-gets-it-wrong/">"</a> where he states:</span><br />
<blockquote>
"Casey is essentially making the claim that because Bitcoins have no uses  outside of acting as a money, they are inherently worthless.  I have  argued against this in previous articles and I will repeat myself here.   This is a fallacious argument.  To claim Bitcoins are nothing is like  claiming your operating system is nothing, therefore it is worth  nothing.  Clearly an inordinate amount of time and resources went into  the development of your computer&#8217;s operating system.  The time and  resources that went into the development of the software constitutes  &#8220;something&#8221;, which is obviously more than nothing.  <i><b>Software can have inherent properties that give it value in and of itself.</b></i>  In the case of Bitcoins, they are imbued with value by the free market  because of the properties they have that allow them to act as a store of  wealth and as a trade facilitator.  Those properties which allow  Bitcoins to act in this <i>specific capacity</i> are exactly the same  properties that gold has which allow gold to act as a store of wealth  and as a trade facilitator.  Again, even if gold had absolutely no other  uses besides sitting in bank vaults as ingots, gold would still be a  money."</blockquote>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</span><br />
<br />
Returning to the two primary criticisms, Michael Suede presents a convincing pro-bitcoin argument in <a href="http://www.libertariannews.org/2011/06/21/against-the-gold-standard/">"Against the Gold Standard"</a>. Echoing my comments on the Keiser Report, Suede writes:<br />
<blockquote>
"What system is to prevent the arbitrary replication of receipts for gold  under a gold standard?  Unless we give up digital transactions and  outlaw the use of paper receipts as a society, there is nothing that can  prevent it.<br />
<br />
This core problem must be addressed by gold standard advocates if they  want to argue that gold is superior to encrypted digital currencies like  Bitcoin.   Since gold can not be shoved down a transmission wire,  unless the gold standard advocates want to argue that all transactions must  be made with physical specie, they have no possible way of getting  around this one fatal flaw with the gold standard."</blockquote>
Clearly recognizing the limitations of gold and a gold monetary standard, C. Harwick in <a href="http://thri.ca/archives/551">"The History of Gold and the Future of Bitcoin"</a> states:<br />
<blockquote>
"That is to say, if the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value">subjective theory of value</a>  means anything, 'unique cryptographic hash' is not inherently less  valuable than 'shiny rock', even if it has no representation in physical  space. Each has only the value that people give to it."</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">(1) Intrinsic Value and Bitcoin</span> - I believe that this initial rejection of bitcoin on intrinsic value grounds stems from a lack of understanding of cryptographic protocols, specifically the mathematical integrity of the <a href="http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20071222072154/http://rpow.net/">RPOW</a> (Reusable Proofs of Work). For more elaboration on the topic of RPOW and bitcoin's cryptographic elements, see my article <a href="http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2011/05/bitcoin-timing-is-everything.html">"Bitcoin: Timing is Everything"</a>.<br />
<br />
While bitcoin may not have <span style="font-style: italic;">tangible</span> intrinsic value, it is still a binary display of a discreet and provably scarce cryptographic item. This is what imbues bitcoin with 'gold-like' qualities compared to a digital movie which has intrinsic value but is infinitely copyable.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">(2) A Binary Corollary to Mises' Regression Theorem</span> - The regression theorem is not forward-looking and in the binary digital world of the 21st century a theorem corollary is needed to account for arbitrary enforcement and confiscation against a competing nonpolitical monetary system. This <span style="font-style: italic;">binary corollary</span> weighs the importance of a modern money's survivability and states that a digital money is exempt from the regression theorem specifically if: (a) the network can be demonstrated to be immune from State enforcement and termination; and (b) the monetary unit can be defensible against State confiscation.<br />
<br />
Due to its p2p decentralised structure, bitcoin satisfies both of the above conditions of the corollary. A permanent disruption of bitcoin's p2p distributed global network would require a practical shutdown of the Internet itself, something the authorities would be reluctant to do since it would simultaneously devastate the broader economy. Furthermore, the monetary unit itself is defensible against State confiscation because it is protected by strong cryptography and the units exist only on the distributed nodes of the network. Actually, bitcoin units are never really transferred but the block chain records the necessary adjustments to ownership. This is related to the <span style="font-style: italic;">tangible</span> intrinsic value discussion because decentralisation has actually achieved defensibility against State confiscation since any other non-digital type of intrinsic value would be subject to confiscation via its centralised location.<br />
<br />
This makes sense because as the State-dominated monetary world inevitably expands, the value component assigned to a cryptocurrency for its survivability, or ultimate resiliency, features may be greater than what the market assigns to its exchange value component. It may even be greater than what the market assigns to its value component for user-defined anonymity and untraceability. Without a world reserve fiat currency and the massive exponential debt from the centrally-planned monetary systems, early leaders of Austrian economics probably would not have considered the disproportionate importance of mere survivability for a currency competitor. It was only slowly dawning on them that the power of the monetary monopoly was the most insidious monopoly of all and the most fiercely protected.<br />
<br />
Friedrich Hayek led the way in 1976 with his monumental <a href="http://mises.org/books/denationalisation.pdf"><span style="font-style: italic;">Denationalisation of Money</span></a> thesis championing competing and nonpolitical currencies. In making legal tender irrelevant, bitcoin as money indeed follows the Hayekian model of <a href="http://mises.org/daily/3204">"A Free-Market Monetary System"</a> where it has evolved, and is still evolving, from a competing currency environment. <quote>Additionally, the new <span style="font-style: italic;">binary corollary</span> to the regression theorem compliments and strengthens Mises' regression theorem, allowing for a  justifiable cryptocurrency monetary unit that can achieve monetary freedom during our lifetime.<br /><br />For further reading:</quote><br />

In a word, no.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Why not?</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong>  There are two levels to consider. First, there's the straight currency  level &#8211; what is supposed to be the official monetary unit. Then there is  &#8220;other,&#8221; which I distinguish as different from the official monetary  unit because the Constitution doesn&#8217;t prohibit private parties from  creating media of exchange for their own uses, as long as those media of  exchange are non-fraudulent and they&#8217;re operated in an otherwise honest  commercial fashion.</p><p>But the official unit of currency is supposed  to be the dollar, and I'll tell you exactly what a dollar is &#8211; it's  371.25 grains of silver in the form of a coin. That was determined as a  historical fact in 1792. Actually the dollar was adopted before the  Constitution was even written. It was adopted by the Continental  Congress under the Articles of Confederation, the so-called Spanish  milled dollar, which was the actual unit that was circulating then,  because there had been essentially no coinage under the various colonial  regimes in colonial America. So that's the dollar unit.</p><p>Well, do  we have that now? The answer is, "Well, essentially, no." First,  obviously they are not coining a true dollar, they coin a Liberty Silver  Dollar, but that's 480 grains, not 371.25 grains. And you have various  gold coinage with dollar denominations on it, but those dollar  denominations have no real relationship in terms of market exchange  ratio to a silver unit of 371.25 grains.</p><p>So the short answer is  that within the coinage system we don&#8217;t have what we're supposed to  have. We have silver coins, we have gold coins, but they&#8217;re not properly  weighted or regulated. And then, of course, we have these base metallic  coins, which have no constitutional status at all &#8211; at least with  respect to being legal tender for their face values. So on the coinage  side, we have a mélange and a mess. At least there is some silver and  gold coinage, but it doesn&#8217;t meet the constitutional requirements.</p><p>On  the other side, the so-called official paper money side, the  Constitution does not provide for official paper money. What it does  address are two provisions; the first, dealing with the states,  specifically says, "No state shall emit bills of credit." As a word of  explanation, bills of credit were the founding fathers' terminology for  paper currency. </p><p>This is interesting because the paper currency  they actually used and emitted were bills of credit that promised to pay  something, typically gold and silver coins, specified on the face of  the bill. So even those types of paper currency, fully redeemable paper  currency, were outlawed for the states because the states had emitted  them in vast excess. That was the historical basis for the outlawry.</p><p>Now,  turning our attention to Congress, you need to recall that Congress  only has the powers that are granted to it. You don&#8217;t look in the  Constitution for prohibitions on Congress's authority and assume that it  can do everything that isn't prohibited. You look for delegations of  authority, and you assume that anything that hasn&#8217;t been delegated is  prohibited.</p><p>If you look at the original draft of the Constitution  in the Constitutional Convention, the Federal Convention of 1787, it  said, "Congress shall have the power to borrow money and emit bills on  the credit of the United States." </p><p>That language was taken from  the Articles of Confederation. The Congress operating under those  articles had the power to borrow money and emit bills &#8211; emit paper  currency &#8211; and they did it. They emitted the so-called continental  currency from which came the phrase "not worth a continental" because  they emitted so much of it that it depreciated very close to  worthlessness.</p><p>At the Constitutional Convention, you had people in  attendance who had been members of the Continental Congress. They had  been members of various state legislatures. These were the leading  political figures in the country. They had to a large extent been the  ones who had emitted continental currency or had emitted various state  bills of credit. So this was a question that wasn't in some way alien to  them as they had been involved in it only a few years earlier.</p><p>So  the first draft of the Constitution was put forward with the same power  that the Continental Congress had, and there was a debate. You look at  Madison's notes, and it was a rather vociferous debate, and they threw  out the words "emit bills," so that now that provision of the  Constitution says, "Congress shall have the power to borrow money on the  credit of the United States." It says nothing about emitting bills.</p><p>Well,  by hypothesis, if the power is proposed and then stricken from the  final version, it doesn&#8217;t exist, right? You don&#8217;t need to be a Harvard  law school graduate to understand that.</p><p>So we look at those two  provisions of the Constitution: One explicitly prohibiting the states  from emitting bills of credit, because otherwise the states would retain  that power. And the other with respect to Congress, where they didn&#8217;t  grant the power, even though the power was proposed to be granted and  that proposal was overruled, and so it wasn't granted. Based on that it  is clear, I would say, that there is no power in Congress or in the  states to issue bills of credit.</p><p>What we have now is something I  think goes almost beyond the bill of credit, though it&#8217;s not really fiat  currency because the Federal Reserve note, according to the statute, is  supposed to be redeemed in "lawful money." So in principle one could go  back to the Federal Reserve Bank or one could take it to the Treasury &#8211;  both have the obligation of redemption &#8211; and you could exchange a  Federal Reserve note for one of these base metallic coins now in  circulation. So, I guess it still could be called a bill of credit in  the sense that you can actually receive some coinage, but what is the  coinage that you receive?</p><p>Interestingly, we had an example of this  type of problem in the period around the Civil War. During the Civil  War and just after, the Union Government issued &#8220;greenbacks&#8221; &#8211; legal  tender U.S. Treasury notes &#8211; and that was the first time that the  government had purported to issue any kind of paper currency under the  Constitution.</p><p>They did it once again under a wartime emergency &#8211;  and for a short time, those things were not redeemed because the  government was not paying out gold except as interest on bonds. They had  to suspend specie payments during the war, but the Supreme Court upheld  the constitutionality of that issuance of those greenbacks, I think  erroneously, but they upheld it specifically on the basis that the  greenbacks were to be redeemed in the constitutional currency of gold  and silver.</p><p>All right, so even the furthest extent of error that  has been made by the judicial system, with respect to paper currency,  was premised on that paper currency being a true bill of credit in that  it would be redeemed in the constitutional coinage of the country.</p><p>Well,  if you look at the Federal Reserve note, you have a number of problems  with it: Number one, it's not issued by the Treasury. It's issued by  this banking cartel. No Federal Reserve note can come into existence  unless one of the 12 regional banks, each of which is a private  corporation, goes to the Board of Governors with certain assets defined  in the statute and asks the Board of Governors to generate Federal  Reserve notes.</p><p>The Board of Governors can't generate Federal  Reserve notes on its own, neither can the Treasury. So these things are  being generated by a private corporation, and they&#8217;re not redeemable as a  matter of law in the official constitutional silver or gold currency of  the country. So they probably have four or five constitutional strikes  against them. Especially if you look at the difference between U.S.  Treasury notes and Federal Reserve notes. Treasury notes were always the  product of some specific statute enacted by Congress, where Congress  would say that so many millions of dollars' worth of these notes are to  be emitted.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Right, and emitting those notes obviously falls within their right to borrow money.</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong>  Well, assuming that that's what they&#8217;re doing &#8211; and that was the  Supreme Court's decision in the legal tender cases after the Civil War &#8211;  they said, well, that&#8217;s a form of borrowing money. It really isn't  because it's a form of generating money. You don&#8217;t borrow money when you  generate money &#8211; the concept is nonsense &#8211; but even assuming that  that's the case, Congress has the power to borrow money and they specify  a certain amount of money.</p><p>Well, they haven&#8217;t specified a certain  amount of money to come out of the Federal Reserve system ever. There's  absolutely no specification &#8211; that's all left to the whim of the  Federal Reserve banks. So assuming that Congress had the power to  generate Treasury notes, they would do it in a controlled fashion by  telling us exactly how much is supposed to come out with each emission.  Here they have purported to delegate this power to a consortium of  private bankers, so this is like six or seven strikes. This is worse  than baseball.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> And at this point,  you really cannot redeem your Federal Reserve notes for anything  anywhere. I mean, you can trade them with other people for other goods,  and then you can take them to the bank and redeem them in base metal  coins worth a fraction of their face value.</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong>  Well, initially Federal Reserve notes were required to be redeemed in  gold, and then that was removed in '33 and '34 with the gold seizure. So  now we have notes that, as John Exter used to say, are an IOU-Nothing  Currency &#8211; because with respect to the banks and with respect to the  Treasury, they owe you nothing, and if you go into the marketplace, you  may be able to get whatever someone will give you for them, but you have  no legal right to demand any particular amount of anything.</p><p>A  redeemable currency, by law, is a currency that has a requirement that  the issuer redeem it in something that is specified, a certain weight of  gold, a certain weight of silver, whatever. So at one time, Federal  Reserve notes were redeemable currency.</p><p>Now, I suppose, as I said,  they&#8217;re not a fiat currency because you can get this base metallic  stuff for them, but the constitutional requirement, assuming that you  could have a bill of credit at all, would be that it had to be paid in  the constitutional coinage unit. So this is the problem.  Constitutionally, the thing is a first-class mess.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong>  So you&#8217;ve got eight strikes or so against this currency,  constitutionally speaking, and yet the situation persists. Why hasn&#8217;t  there been a successful challenge to the system in the courts? </p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong>  Looking at challenges that have come up over the years, I would start  by looking back to the '30s, because in the '30s you had two events. The  first was a gold seizure followed by the second, the prohibition of  gold clauses in contracts.</p><p>You had one set of cases that came up  to the Supreme Court dealing with the prohibition of gold clause  contracts, and one can only look at those and shake one&#8217;s head and say,  "Well, this is just, you know, fraud, complete double talk, nonsense."  And interestingly enough, they never took on the gold seizure. They  never decided a case on the gold seizure, even though cases were brought  to them. They refused to hear them, and I think the reason was even  they knew they couldn't figure out how to justify that one, how to  rationalize that.</p><p>Subsequently, you&#8217;ve had attempts by people to  challenge the Federal Open Market Committee in particular, because the  Federal Open Market Committee of course is composed not only of the  members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</p><p>Now,  arguably, because they&#8217;re appointed by the president and confirmed by  the Senate, you could say they&#8217;re officials of the government, although  that's an open question that's never really been decided. But the other  members of that committee are representatives of the private Federal  Reserve regional banks, about which there have been a number of  challenges brought on the ground that you can't allow private parties to  participate in that kind of a committee &#8211; a committee that is  essentially making governmental monetary policy.</p><p>Every one of  those challenges has been thrown out without reaching the merits.  They&#8217;ve been thrown out on some kind of standing ground &#8211; either the  courts have refused to hear them at all, or they&#8217;ve thrown them out on  what I would call tangential grounds, really not getting to the merits. I  think the ultimate reason for that is probably out of fear or prudence,  depending on how you want to characterize it.</p><p>I mean, if I'm a  judge and somebody comes to me with one of these cases and says, "I want  you to overturn this entire monetary structure by knocking out this  important provision or that important provision," I say to myself,  "Well, yes, I guess I could do that, legally speaking. I can write an  opinion saying that this provision of the law is unconstitutional and  it's no longer effective."</p><p>But then what happens?</p><p>I can't  write, in my opinion, an order to Congress to pass a particular statute  to correct that situation, so although I can throw a judicial monkey  wrench into the gears, I can't do anything to prevent the disaster that  will then occur as a result of blowing up that mechanism. Ergo, wearing  the hat of a judge, I'm going to stand back and not get involved but  rather leave it to Congress to solve, if possible.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong>  But once you start down that path where you have, let's say, a certain  amount of elasticity on when you follow the Constitution and when you  just look the other way, doesn&#8217;t that set the stage for all sorts of  gyrations and further miscarriages of justice and even fraud? As Doug  Casey has commented on numerous occasions, at this point the country is  being operated on a very corrupt basis.</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong> Well, I agree with him 100%. After the Civil War, in the <em>Knox v. Lee</em>  legal tender case, the Supreme Court could have said, "Yes, we  understand this was done during the Civil War, but it&#8217;s  unconstitutional, and you can't continue with this. And so any contracts  that were made in this illegal money will be revalued in constitutional  money." If they had taken that position back then, they could have  worked it all out because they did just that for the confederate states.</p><p>The  confederate states were considered to be an illegal operation entirely,  a criminal rebellion. The confederate states generated a huge amount of  paper currency, and a number of cases came to the Supreme Court after  the Civil War dealing with the enforcement of contracts in the  confederate states that had been made implicitly or explicitly in  confederate money. What were we going to do with these contracts?</p><p>And  the Supreme Court said, "Well, to the extent the contracts were for an  illegal purpose, such as supplying arms to the Confederate Army, then  they were void, but if it was a contract to buy wood or something from a  farmer or whatever, these people were forced into using that currency  because that's where they were, they had no choice, and we will simply  revalue those contracts and enforce them for their fair worth, that's  just simple equity."</p><p>They could have done the exact same thing  with respect to the greenbacks of the Civil War &#8211; saying that the  greenbacks were unconstitutional and let's never do this again. But they  didn&#8217;t, and as a result set a precedent, and one precedent leads to  another, and that's precisely why we're here.</p><p>The same thing  during the 1930s with the gold clause cases: They could have declared  that statute unconstitutional right then and there because nothing had  yet happened, but they played this game in the Supreme Court.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong>  So, the Supreme Court ducked crucial issues and allowed precedents to  be set for the creation of a monetary system that is clearly  unconstitutional and, importantly, unsound. So here we are today, with  everything totally screwed up. Do you think the monetary system now  operating in the U.S. &#8211; and around the world, for that matter &#8211; can  survive as is? Or is it going to have to change, and relatively soon?</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong>  Well, it&#8217;s going to have to change, raising the questions, &#8220;In what  direction and under whose control?&#8221; Historically, the United States has  seen each one of these faulty systems go into self-destruction mode,  followed by the government ratcheting things up to the next-higher  level.</p><p>Thus the First Bank of the United States was followed by  the Second Bank of the United States, neither of which was really a  central bank. They were just private banks that operated as fiscal  agents for the government. And there were a lot of state banks, and  these all went into some kind of failure mode.</p><p>Along comes the  Civil War, and they come up with the National Banking System, which was a  cartelization of banks tied into the U.S. Treasury, so they moved it  from the level of individual banks &#8211; that might have been state  chartered or chartered by Congress but were nevertheless essentially  separate private entities &#8211; into a cartel structure that had a direct  connection to the Treasury.</p><p>Now that direct connection to the  Treasury was that those banks had to buy U.S. Treasury bonds, and then  they would deposit those with the Treasury, and they'd get 90% of the  value of the bonds back in currency, which they could then use for their  own private purposes. That system didn&#8217;t work because at that point in  time, people were not interested in amassing ever greater federal debt,  and the expansion of that banking system depended upon amassing ever  greater amounts of federal debt.</p><p>Well, that system goes into  crisis and what do they do? Do they correct it? No, they go to the next  level and give us the national lender of last resort, the Federal  Reserve System. Essentially improving the cartel structure. That thing  lasts only from 1914 to 1932, about 20 years, before it collapses. Does  Roosevelt solve this problem by dealing strictly with fractional  reserve? No, he raises it to another level by expanding the powers of  the Federal Reserve System and taking gold away from the American  people.</p><p>That lasts until after World War II, at Bretton Woods,  when the United States Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve  note become the World Central Bank and the World Central Reserve  Currency, as a matter of fact, and how long does that last? Until 1971,  right? By then, so much gold has left the country because of the  profligate policies of Congress, especially the war in Vietnam and  Johnson's War on Poverty, that Nixon finally has to stop gold redemption  in 1971.</p><p>Which brings us to the present, and we are again back in  crisis mode, and what are they telling us? "Oh, we've got to go to the  next level. We've got to create a New World Central Bank." Maybe this  will be the IMF or whatever, but we are going to expand the thing to the  next level until we have the final blowout. Because this is what  they&#8217;ve always done.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> It seems to  me that once the U.S. government starts talking about a global currency  that Americans will finally say, "No, enough, we're just not going  there.&#8221; For a lot of reasons, nationalism and because of the negative  examples being provided by the failing experiment with the euro?</p><p>While  I have long been shocked at the depth of the apathy of the American  people, I have a hard time believing they would turn our currency over  to the IMF or any international body. If you agree, doesn&#8217;t that mean  that we could be at the point now &#8211; in this crisis &#8211; where it's not  going to go any further? That the madness stops here?</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong>  Yes, I was not saying that their plan will work, rather I was just  restating what their plan is. I don&#8217;t think it's going to be successful.  The euro gives us a good example of why it's not going to be  successful. Also, they have another difficulty; to set up a system of  this kind, they&#8217;re going to have to pass some serious legislation to tie  us into some kind of world currency system.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Which will never happen.</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong>  That's right. Can you imagine what the deadlock would be in Congress  over that? So actually we have an opportunity here. The door has finally  opened for some serious monetary reform because the other side has come  essentially to a dead end.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Because they can't keep amassing ever-increasing amounts of national debt. We're reaching the limit on that.</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong>  That's right. So here we are, and now the question really comes back to  whether there are enough people in America who understand this and are  willing to take the appropriate steps to start putting in some  alternative?</p><p>I don&#8217;t think this can be done from the top down. I  don&#8217;t think Congress is going to solve this problem, and certainly the  bankers are not going to give them the right legislation to solve this  problem. It has to be solved from the bottom up.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Bottom up?</p><p><strong>EDWIN: </strong>The  beauty of the constitutional system is, we have these intermediate  political bodies called the state governments that have certain reserved  constitutional authority. They haven&#8217;t been exercising it for a long  time, but it's there, and part of that is monetary, and interestingly  enough this has already been decided by the Supreme Court. It's not as  if I'm inventing this idea.</p><p>After the Civil War, we had a similar  situation. Before they went back to gold redemption, you had  depreciating legal tender Treasury notes circulating, and there was gold  and silver circulating as well. That had not been withdrawn from  circulation, so in the first case of this kind, the State of Oregon had a  law that required that its taxes be paid in gold and silver coin and  someone tried to pay in legal-tender Treasury notes on the theory that  Congress has made these legal tender for all debts and therefore that  overrides the laws of the State of Oregon requiring payment of taxes in  gold and silver.</p><p>Well, the case gets all the way to the Supreme  Court and the Supreme Court says "No, wrong. The states have residual  sovereignty.&#8221; They are sovereign governments, except to the extent that  they&#8217;ve surrendered certain powers to the national government, and one  of the powers they have not surrendered is the power of taxation &#8211; one  of the basic governmental powers. I guess you could include borrowing  and spending, so forth and so on, but they have the right to perform  basic governmental functions, taxation being one of them.</p><p>If a  state determines for its own purposes it needs to tax in gold coin and  silver coin or bullion, then the state can do it and Congress has  nothing to say about it. From which it would follow that step number one  would be for a state to start saying, "We&#8217;re going to tax or spend or  borrow," or whatever, in gold coin, silver coin, gold bullion, silver  bullion.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Recently there was legislation in Utah defining gold as being legal for settling debts and so forth. Correct?</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong>  Well, there's a statute that just came out in Utah, which I would call  more of a &#8220;making a statement&#8221; statute than a substantive statute,  because they recognize the United States gold and silver coin as legal  tender. Well, they have no choice &#8211; it is, that's constitutional. The  statute merely recognizes that people can make contracts, enforceable  contracts using gold and silver coin, and that's also their right. But  it's the first time that a state has actually stood up and said  something about monetary policy. Even so, a journey of a thousand  leagues begins with a single step, right?</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong>  Looking at the descent of the dollar and its steep downtrend since 2002  &#8211; against other currencies and, of course, gold &#8211; one can&#8217;t but wonder,  how much further can it fall before you get a real crisis? One that the  government won&#8217;t be able to deal with?</p><p>Based on the historical  precedent you mentioned, it just continues to go down until it reaches  the point they have to come up with something else. Given the strong  probability that, in time, the Fed is going to have to step back in with  another round of quantitative easing, do you think that could be the  trigger for the bottom falling out from under the dollar?</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong>  I think so, because of the large percentage of debt required to finance  the government at this point &#8211; I think it is now running around 46%.  Victor Sperandeo has done some work on hyperinflations and found that  apparently once that number gets over around 40-41%, that's the end.</p><p>According  to his work, in every big example of hyperinflation since the French  Revolution, that number is apparently the tipping point on the  rollercoaster. You&#8217;ve gone over the top, and now gravity takes over and  down you go to the bottom. They can't stop the thing. So we're now <em>at</em>  46%, at least it was on the 12th of May, 46%, and it doesn&#8217;t seem to me  there's any will or intelligence in Congress to correct this, and it's  not going to be the Federal Reserve that corrects this, it's going to  have to be done legislatively.</p><p>Of course, the government could do  something radical to correct the situation &#8211; there is always the  &#8220;if-then&#8221; type analysis, but assuming that they don&#8217;t take radical steps  to correct it, which seems a safe assumption, that&#8217;s the direction  we&#8217;re heading in.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> So we could already be over the top on this, as far as this is concerned.</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong>  Yes, that&#8217;s the fear &#8211; and once we're over the top, that's the end of  the game. The rollercoaster goes to the bottom. There's no stopping it.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong>  Interesting in this whole discussion is that the U.S. has been the  driver in the global adoption of the monetary system we now have,  starting with Bretton Woods and then when Nixon stopped gold  redeemability. At that point, everybody just sort of went along,  continuing to use the U.S. dollar as a de facto reserve currency. But  all of a sudden, today, you look around and can&#8217;t help realizing the  problem is global in scale, leaving none of the paper currencies as a  viable alternative. Are there any conceivable solutions to a crisis of  this scale?</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong> If you want to go back to a  sound currency system and a sound political system &#8211; and by sound  political system, I mean one in which the political powers can't  manipulate money &#8211; then it has to be tied to some free-market commodity,  right? Historically the two that have worked have been gold and silver,  and that actually is the constitutional standard, so unless we want to  change the Constitution, we have to work with that.</p><p>Fortunately it  will work, so we can do that. The mechanism for doing it is the  question, and as I say, it's got to come through the states. Looking at  this from the investor's point of view, I don&#8217;t know if there are good  investments in the collapse of Western civilization. Which is what we're  facing.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID: </strong>A lot of people think that if you own gold, enough gold, that you'll come out of this okay. What is your general view on that?</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong>  In the hyperinflationary event, if you held something like 15% or 20%  of your total portfolio in gold and the rest of it goes to zero, you  won't gain anything but you will not lose anything. That said, my  interest has never really been in this from an investment point of view,  except investment in a political sense.</p><p>Looking down the road in  an attempt to see what this country will look like if we go through a  hyperinflationary event &#8211; and if out of that doesn&#8217;t come a sound  currency and restrictions on the government's power to manipulate money  and credit &#8211; it appears to me that what could emerge is a first-class  fascist police state.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Because  restricting the government&#8217;s ability to manipulate the money also  restricts their ability to do everything that they are currently?  Putting in those restrictions would then limit them from being involved  in so many parts of the economy, as they now are. Obviously, in a  monetary system built around sound money, they couldn&#8217;t keep spending  money at this level.</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong> That's right. If you  have a system based on real money, we would not have this elephantiasis  of government. So that was the great failure of the Supreme Court not  asking, "Wait a minute, if we let them have this, where will that lead?"  They didn&#8217;t look down the road. Maybe they did. Maybe that's what they  wanted. Maybe they were extreme nationalists of the Hamiltonian view of  "The more power the better," but an intelligent person will look and  say, "Wait a minute, we can't put these powers into the hands of mere  politicians."</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> So do you really think a collapse of the Western civilization is avoidable at this point?</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong> No. That's what I'm worried about.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong>  It seems avoidable if the politicians acknowledged the reality of the  situation and dealt with it accordingly, but do you see any hope that  it's politically likely?</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong> Well, I'm going  to give it a year or two to see what the states start doing here. We're  seeing more and more resistance, at least verbally, coming out of state  legislatures and even out of some state governors to various  encroachments by the people in Washington. We&#8217;ve seen some push-back in  the healthcare area, TSA, and then there's this business with illegal  immigration, and now some states are beginning to talk about monetary  reform.</p><p>There's not too much the states can do about TSA. There's  probably not too much they can do about healthcare, because that would  have to be decided in the courts, and god knows that's a wasteland.  Immigration is kind of back and forth/up and down, but on monetary  reform, if a state passed the right statute, they could potentially  bring that about within 30, 60, or 90 days. Especially if they put in  one of these electronic gold/electronic silver type systems, which is  off-the-shelf technology. </p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> How could it work?</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong>  Within 90 days of the passage of the statute, you could have everybody  in that state with electronic gold debit cards dialed into the price  structure in all of the supermarkets and so forth. People could  essentially opt out of the Federal Reserve System if they wanted to.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> So watching the states for a hopeful plan is something we can do.</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong> That's right, and if they don&#8217;t do it within the next year or 18 months, then I would begin to become very pessimistic.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong>  Since we&#8217;re talking about being pessimistic, let&#8217;s talk a bit about the  real dark side of all of this &#8211; namely that it appears to many that the  U.S. is in the early stages of becoming a police state. Supporting that  view, there are things I thought I&#8217;d never see in my lifetime,  institutionally sanctioned renditions and torture, Guantanamo, the  recent Supreme Court ruling that police can kick down your door based  upon hearing what they consider to be a suspicious noise &#8211; the list of  things the government is doing these days goes on and on, including the  current blatant attempt to assassinate Gaddafi. So where do you think we  are on the scale from 1-10, 1 being perfect liberty and 10 being  full-on police state?</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong> About 6-1/2 to 7,  because they&#8217;ve set up the principles for it. You don&#8217;t have to have the  police breaking in every day to have a police state, you simply have to  have the judiciary saying, "If they break in, we'll let them do it."  It's the principle of the thing. The NKVD didn&#8217;t arrest everybody in  Stalin's Russia, but the principle was in place so they could arrest  anybody, and that's the problem.</p><p>If you type &#8220;police brutality&#8221;  into Google or some other search engine, how many YouTube hits do you  think you'll get? Huge number, right? And they become more grotesque  every day. If I were a Supreme Court justice, I might look at this and  say, "This is the real problem in the country," but of course those  people live in an ivory tower, so they don&#8217;t know or perhaps care about  reality. If they did, they would know enough to know this is becoming a  real problem.</p><p>So, as a Supreme Court justice, would I want to give  them a principle that allows the police to solidify and expand that  kind of oppressive behavior? And the answer would have to be, "No, I  don&#8217;t." The Constitution could never have foreseen this or allowed for  this, right?</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong>  And yet they allow for it. Now, either this is the biggest bunch of  idiots that has ever been assembled in judicial robes in the history of  humanity, or there's some other agenda going on here.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Assuming that they are not complete idiots, what could that other agenda be?</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong>  In my view, and I've written about this for years, the people at the  top levels of government understand that their monetary system is  inherently flawed. That we're on the Titanic, in a sense, and they know  that this ship is going to sink. They don&#8217;t know when, but they know  when it sinks, they&#8217;re going to have a huge amount of economic  dislocation, social crisis and civil unrest to the level of revolt.</p><p>So  they started developing this police state mechanism in the hopes of  keeping the lid on the garbage can when the monetary system breaks down.  The upper echelons of the judiciary have been going right along with  this because they know what the program is. This is obvious. No one in  his right mind would stand by and allow the sort of excesses we&#8217;ve seen.</p><p>Just  the other day, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth  Amendment doesn&#8217;t apply at all because you can sue the police after  they&#8217;ve mistakenly broken into your home. But when they break into your  home and they kill you, then what?</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Not a lot of recourse then.</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong>  Right, like that poor ex-marine that was shot 60 times in Arizona, and  he's dead &#8211; now what, can he bring a lawsuit? Have we lost our minds? I  mean, you don&#8217;t have to be a Harvard-educated lawyer to know that this  is insanity. This does not rise to the level of just mere error. No one  in his right mind can write these kinds of opinions, which means that  either they&#8217;re insane, which I don&#8217;t believe, or they have another  agenda, and the judicial opinions are simply camouflage &#8211; they&#8217;re  propaganda to convince us that "Oh well, this is all right" because  Judge Flapdoddle told us that it's all right.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong>  Likewise, when you look at what's been going on with the government&#8217;s  spending, which is clearly insane, I mean, who would have thought they  could even conceive of running a $1.5 trillion annual deficit?</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong> And going up.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong>  And going up, and planning on this continuing well into the future. In  your paper "A Cross of Gold," you mentioned that all told, the U.S.  government&#8217;s total outstanding obligations at this point add up to  something like 200 trillion dollars?</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong> Yes, that's Professor Kotlikoff's, at Boston University, figure, not mine.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong>  So it&#8217;s hard to draw any other conclusion than that the government is  operating in a complete fantasy. That everything is completely off the  rails.  Then you look at the judiciary and some of the things they have  approved and looked the other way on, and it sure begins to look like  fascism to me.</p><p>You and I see it, a lot of our readers look at it,  but most people are so passive about it. Everybody is so quiet, and  there is nobody making any waves &#8211; is that because it's too late? Before  you answer, I'll give you just a quick anecdote that I think makes the  point.</p><p>I was at a party not too long ago with a bunch of young  people, and we were talking about some topic that was mildly  controversial, and one of them said, "I&#8217;d love to look up more about  that online, but I don&#8217;t want it to be part of my permanent search  record.&#8221; So, the youth of America already have it in their heads that  anything they do online is being monitored and will be in their search  records forever and accessible to the government.</p><p>Back to my  question, have we reached that stage where people are quietly huddling  behind the doors of their houses, trying to keep a low profile so the  government will leave them alone?</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong> Given  the current state of things, I'm sure there are a lot of people  deliberately deciding to adopt a low profile, politically or socially. A  lot of this has to do not so much with politics but what your neighbors  or your coworkers will say about you, right? If you tell them something  that is actually happening in the world, you will be labeled a  conspiracy theorist; they&#8217;ll look at you as if you're crazy.</p><p>But  what about the activists? At a certain stage, the great mass of people  will look around for leadership figures. When the economic crisis comes,  they&#8217;re going to want someone to tell them how to get out of it.  They&#8217;re not going to know the answers themselves. The question is, will  there be activists, leadership figures, proposing the right solutions &#8211;  and how soon will they come along?</p><p>That's why I look at this Tea  Party Movement, using that in a generic sense, an indication of the  ground swell of discontent that's out there. There's a huge amount of  that, but at this point it's not particularly directed. Of course the  establishment is trying to co-opt it, with Gingrich and others trying to  claim that they&#8217;re leadership figures in this movement, and that  deflects it from the direction in which it ought to go.</p><p>By  contrast, you do have the Ron Paul-type movement. I mean, look at Ron  Paul as an example. This is not a charismatic figure. He's a very  diffident individual, a very shy individual, not someone that you could  possibly imagine as a man on a white horse in a political sense. He  certainly has had very little real effect in Congress. He's been the  gadfly, he's been the critic, but he hasn&#8217;t put in any legislation of  consequence that has been passed. He's made a lot of noise about the  Federal Reserve, but he's constantly being blocked by the real power  structure in Congress in terms of getting anything done there. Yet  nevertheless a whole political movement has essentially crystallized  around him.</p><p>I look at him as the surfer on the wave. The surfer is  not the important thing, the wave is the important thing. The surfer  would be nowhere without the wave. That wave is out there, and it's just  waiting for the right surfer. He's the first one that's come along, but  there will be others, perhaps some state governor who is actually  competent, and he looks at this monetary system and he says, "To hell  with this. Here's what we have to do," and they put in that alternative  currency statute, the proper one, not the kind of statement that was  made in Utah, but a proper functioning one. In which case he will become  the next president of the United States, and then we will see what will  happen.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Any time the states try  to go their own way on issues that the federal government doesn&#8217;t like,  the federal government starts to threaten them with losing their highway  funds or education funds, or whatever. Isn't that part of the problem?</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong>  Well, it certainly is part of the problem, and that's why you're going  to have to have some real leader in the state who is going to say, "We  have priorities, and our first priority is correcting the monetary  problem, the currency problem, and we'll worry about those federal  education funds later. In fact, what we may do is stop paying some money  to the federal government."</p><p>Unfortunately, once you allow the  federal government to have the kind of influence they now have over the  states, the states have essentially rolled over. So, at some stage, they  have to say no.</p><p>That's why I say that at some point down the  line, if we see nothing happening on the state level &#8211; if we see these  bills being put in and being constantly defeated, and no one comes  forward to take leadership on these issues &#8211; well, I'll throw up my  hands and say, "We just don&#8217;t have the leadership group, we don&#8217;t have  the Patrick Henrys, we don&#8217;t have the Thomas Jeffersons, we don&#8217;t have  the Sam Adams, we just don&#8217;t have those people anymore, and that's the  end.&#8221;</p><p>But I don&#8217;t believe it will come to that. We have over 300 million people in this country, we can't find a few hundred?</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong>  Well, we will certainly keep an eye on the states for somebody to show  up one of these days. Governor Christie in New Jersey seems like a  pretty sound guy.</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong> I want to see just two  things, because there are two things of real consequence right now in  terms of the major powers of government historically and in terms of  political philosophy. Those two things are the power of the purse and  the power of the sword. In order to continue spending at the levels it  now is, the government has to maintain control over the monetary system,  and it has to have some kind of control over military and police force.</p><p>Under  our Constitution, those two powers are supposed to be ultimately in the  hands of the people. We're supposed to have a free-market-oriented and  -controlled monetary system based on gold and silver, so the politicians  really do not have control over the purse. They have to come to us and  ask for taxes. They can't manipulate the money and use inflation as a  hidden tax. We've lost that. We failed to assert it &#8211; let's put it that  way.</p><p>On the other side, we see this police state developing, with a  centralized Department of Homeland Security in Washington that has  tentacles reaching down into every local and state police force. This is  completely contrary to the Constitution because the Constitution tells  us that the thing that's necessary for the security of a free state is  what? A well-regulated militia. And what is a well-regulated militia?  It's composed, as the Virginia Declaration of Rights in 1776 said even  before the U.S. Constitution, of the body of the people &#8211; the people  organized in a certain way. Think of Switzerland.</p><p>Well, we've lost  control over those two key elements, and until we get them back, we can  only continue down this road to the full-blown police state. So in  sizing up any politician, I'd start by asking them these two things:  &#8220;What are you going to do in the state to return us to a system of  constitutional currency with an alternative system in this state because  we can't do it in Congress?&#8221; And, number two, &#8220;What are you going to do  to revitalize some kind of state militia structure, perhaps using  Switzerland as the model because they&#8217;ve been very successful over the  years, so that we are no longer under the control or answerable to Janet  Napolitano?&#8221;</p><p>If the states can&#8217;t regain control over those two  things, the rest of it is a waste of time. If you don&#8217;t have control  over the high ground, as the military people would say, then you&#8217;ve lost  the battle. Education funds, transportation funds, all the rest of this  stuff is not even icing on the cake if you let the federal government  continue to have those two powers.</p><p>They took power over the money a  long time ago, and they have been systemically organizing this police  state since well before 9/11; in fact, the plans for the Patriot Act  were drawn up before 9/11. They understand where the high ground is, and  that's why if you are a state politician and you can't answer those two  questions &#8211; if you don&#8217;t tell me that those are your number one and  number two priorities &#8211; forget it, we'll look to somebody else for  leadership.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> It seems to me that  unless and until there is some sort of a push-back on the state level,  the situation is going to grow increasingly dangerous, looking for a  trigger, so to speak. Much in the way the Arab Spring blew up almost  overnight. People looked at that and said, how did that ever happen?  These are some of the most oppressed people in the world, ignorant and  backwards and everything else, and all of a sudden they are in the  streets, risking their lives for more freedom. So, it would seem that  it's just a matter of time before we see something akin to an American  Spring here.</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong> Oh, I think so, yes. It's  just terrible to think that we have to take second seat to the Egyptians  in the promotion of liberty. Not to criticize the Egyptians, but Egypt  has never been considered to be a country that philosophically was in  the forefront of that area.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong>  Speaking of Egypt, I think the jury is still out on whether the military  will allow the freedom movement there to take power. The Saudis are  falling all over themselves to give the Egyptian military money, as is  the U.S. government, so it would appear that we're now trying to  solidify their power.</p><p><strong>EDWIN:</strong> Please don&#8217;t say &#8220;we&#8221; when referring to the people in Washington. Don&#8217;t include me in that list.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong>  (laughs) Doug Casey often says the same thing. And on that note, I&#8217;ll  sign off by thanking you very much for your time. Let&#8217;s do it again some  time.</p><p><em>For those of you who wish to hear more from Dr. Vieira, James Turk of </em><em>the GoldMoney Foundation recently posted a video interview that you may find of interest. <a href="http://www.goldmoney.com/video/vieira-interview.html" target="_blank">Here's the link.</a></em></p>

Jon gives us  some of his background and history relating to digital currencies and  issues surrounding the New Monetary Future. We spin off on many topics  related to the bitcoin ecosystem, news items, the concept of money and  the reactions to bitcoin by the State, gold-bugs,  old-man-bitter-cypherpunks and more. This is our first episode with Jon  and we hope to have him back on a regular basis as there are very few in  this world with the background and understanding of what is going on  right now and who really GET IT.<br /><br />Listen to the interview <a href="http://agoristradio.com/?powerpress_pinw=446-podcast">here</a>.

<div class='post-body entry-content'>
By Cindy Cohn<br />Electronic Frontier Foundation<br />Monday, June 20, 2011<br /><br />              <div id="content" class="withsidebar deeplinks"><div class="node blog "><div class="deeplinkspost"><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/06/eff-and-bitcoin"><span style="font-style: italic;">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/06/eff-and-bitcoin</span></a><p>For several months, EFF has been following the movement around <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>,  an electronic payment system that touts itself as "the first  decentralized digital currency." We helped inform our members about this  unique project through our <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/01/bitcoin-step-toward-censorship-resistant">blog</a> and we experimented with accepting Bitcoin donations for several months in an account that was started by others.</p> <p>However, we&#8217;ve recently removed the Bitcoin donation option from the <a href="https://www.eff.org/helpout">Other Ways to Help</a> page on the EFF website, and we have decided to not accept Bitcoins.  We decided on this course of action for a few reasons:</p> <p><b>1. We don't fully understand the complex legal issues involved with creating a new currency system.</b>   Bitcoin raises untested legal concerns related to securities law, the  Stamp Payments Act, tax evasion, consumer protection and money  laundering, among others. And that&#8217;s just in the U.S. While EFF is often  the defender of people ensnared in legal issues arising from new  technologies, we try very hard to keep EFF from becoming the actual  subject of those fights or issues.  Since there is no case law on this  topic, and the legal implications are still very unclear, we worry that  our acceptance of Bitcoins may move us into the possible subject role.     </p> <p><b>2. We don't want to mislead our donors.</b>  When people make a  donation to a nonprofit like EFF, they expect us to use their donation  to support our work.  Because the legal territory around exchanging  Bitcoins into cash is still uncertain, we are not comfortable spending  the many Bitcoins we have accumulated.  Because of this, we&#8217;re giving  the Bitcoins that have been accumulated, or that may accumulate in the  future, in the account set up in our name to the  <a href="https://freebitcoins.appspot.com/">Bitcoin faucet</a>, so that they can continue to circulate in the community.<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/06/eff-and-bitcoin#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a>    </p> <p><b>3. People were misconstruing our acceptance of Bitcoins as an endorsement of Bitcoin.</b>   We were concerned that some people may have participated in the  Bitcoin project specifically because EFF accepted Bitcoins, and perhaps  they therefore believed the investment in Bitcoins was secure and  risk-free. While we&#8217;ve been following the Bitcoin movement with a great  degree of interest, EFF has never endorsed Bitcoin.  In fact, we  generally don&#8217;t endorse any type of product or service &#8211; and Bitcoin is  no exception. </p> <p>We appreciate the outpouring of support we have received from the  Bitcoin community and we share that community's commitment to privacy  and innovation. We also appreciate their frustration with the privacy  problems posed by existing on-line payment systems. However, EFF will no  longer be accepting or spending Bitcoins.</p><p id="footnote-1"></p>Notes:<br />[1] We understand that we cannot close the account  that has been set up in EFF&#8217;s name and that returning the donations to  the individual donors would be complex and difficult.<br /><br />For further reading:<br /><a href="http://techliberation.com/2011/06/21/eff-gone-wobbly-on-bitcoin/">"EFF Gone Wobbly on Bitcoin"</a>, Jim Harper, June 21, 2011<br /></div></div></div>

MIT student Edward Z. Yang has an excellent piece on <a href="http://blog.ezyang.com/2011/06/the-cryptography-of-bitcoin/">"The Cryptography of Bitcoin"</a> (June 3, 2011), which explains the cryptographic components of bitcoin. While I disagree with his conclusion that upgrading the crypto algorithm in the future is a non-starter, he presents a good overview of how multiple different cryptographic primitives are assembled in the bitcoin protocol. Yang writes:<br />
<blockquote>
"Bitcoin makes some interesting choices of the cryptography it chooses,  and the rest of this post will explore those choices. Bitcoin makes use  of two hashing functions, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-256</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIPEMD">RIPEMD-160</a>, but it also uses <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_DSA">Elliptic Curve DSA</a>  on the curve secp256k1 to perform signatures. The C++ implementation  uses a local copy of the Crypto++ library for mining, and OpenSSL for  normal usage."</blockquote>
Yang also comments on the hashing in bitcoin:<br />
<blockquote>
"This is the technically novel use of cryptography in Bitcoin, and it  is used to answer the question, 'With only traditional signatures, Alice  can resend bitcoins she doesn&#8217;t actually have as many times as she  wants, effectively creating multiple branches of a transaction tree. How  do we prevent this?' The answer Bitcoin provides is, 'Transaction  chains are certified by the solution of a computationally hard problem  (mining), and once a transaction is confirmed by its inclusion in a  block, clients prefer the transaction chain that has the highest  computational cost associated with it, invalidating any other spending  on other branches.' Even if you don&#8217;t believe in decentralized currency,  you have to admit, this is pretty elegant."</blockquote>

<h2 id="page-title" class="node_28861_title"></h2>In <a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/editorial.php?page=articles/police-state-amerika">"Police State Amerika"</a>,                                                                          David Galland, Managing Director of Casey Research, has a conversation with constitutional lawyer and monetary expert  Dr. Edwin Vieira, who holds  four degrees from Harvard University. From the article:<em></em><p></p><blockquote><p>"Dr. Vieira and I covered a lot of ground in our lengthy conversation,  most of it related to the U.S. monetary system &#8211; its history, nature,  and likely fate. But in between the details and analysis of how it is  that the nation&#8217;s fiscal and monetary affairs have deteriorated to the  current dismal state &#8211; and how the global sovereign debt crisis is  likely to be resolved &#8211; a couple of deeply concerning truths emerged.</p><p>Concerning because, taken together, these truths have set the stage for a full-blown police state.</p><p>The  first of these two truths has to do the nature of today&#8217;s money. To set  the stage, I present the following <a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/editorial.php?page=articles/police-state-amerika">excerpt</a> from Dr. Vieira&#8217;s paper <a href="http://www.gata.org/files/Vieira-ACrossOfGold-10-21-2010.pdf"><em>A Cross of Gold</em></a> related to the original Federal Reserve Act."</p></blockquote><p></p>Galland then goes on to explain how the arbitrary nature of law enforcement drives citizen submission:<br /><blockquote>"To understand why this is so important as a precedent to the  evolution of fascism, view the matter in reverse by considering how  different things would be if the constitutionally mandated requirement  that the government&#8217;s currency be redeemable in good money &#8211; gold or  silver &#8211; was still enforced. In that case, the government&#8217;s ability to  spend would be effectively limited by what it collected in revenues.  That, in turn, would have greatly curtailed its ability to grow into the  bloated juggernaut it has.<blockquote><p></p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>In other words, the American ideal of a limited government would have been hard wired.</p><p>....his final conclusion is that they are operating with an unseen agenda in  mind. In his view, that agenda revolves around the rising potential for  widespread social unrest emanating from the nationwide monetary Ponzi  scheme. Doing its part to prepare, the Supreme Court has been  establishing the precedents necessary for the government to cope with  that unrest.</p><p>On this general theme, Dr. Vieira correctly points out that, in order  for a fascist state to exist does not require the government to actually  arrest anyone &#8211; but only that they <em>can</em> arrest anyone. Do you think you broke a law over the past week? I can assure you that every one of you dear readers broke a <em>lot</em>  of laws. Sure, you may not have realized you were breaking a law &#8211; but,  as the old saying goes, 'Ignorance of the law is no excuse.'"</p></blockquote><p></p>For further viewing:<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHKD4wSpE78">"Edwin Vieira Interview with James Turk"</a>, GoldMoney, June 10, 2011<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span>

<br />
Three weeks ago I discovered bitcoin. It sounded interesting enough that I decided to devote an entire Saturday to it&#8212;that was my &#8220;day of bitcoin.&#8221; My day of bitcoin evolved into my three weeks of bitcoin. In that time, I have been obsessively reading about it, writing about it, buying it, and creating businesses for it. As far as I can recall, I have never been so obsessed about anything. But the reason I am obsessed with bitcoin is simple: it is the most incredible thing to ever happen in the world. I am not exaggerating. We are presently witnessing the most disruptive change to ever happen to collective human behavior.    Although there have been other disruptive changes to human behavior in the past, bitcoin is happening much faster than those. Consider, for instance, computing.<br />
<br />
Charles Babbage invented the mechanical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_engine">Analytical Engine</a>  in the 1830s. It took on the order of a century or more before those seeds of an idea  blossomed into something that actually started being used on a large  scale. Or consider, say, the internet, which was invented in the 1960s, but  took on the order of decades before it saturated the world. That was faster than computing, but still long compared to bitcoin. Bitcoin was only invented about 2.5 years ago. And already, I have been able to ask random people about it, and they  know what I&#8217;m talking about. If the growth of bitcoin continues exponentially like most widely useful  technologies, it will only be on the order of years&#8212;not centuries, not  even decades, but individual years&#8212;before virtually everyone is using  it.   <br />
<br />
The standard term for such a rapid change is a &#8220;singularity.&#8221; Robin Hanson predicted an <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/fastgrow.html">economic singularity</a>. Bitcoin, as I will argue, is that singularity. (Hat tip to noagendamarket on the <a href="http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=8430.msg123571#msg123571">bitcoin forum</a> for reminding me of Robin Hanson&#8217;s article.) <br />
<div style="font-weight: bold;">
<br />
What is bitcoin?</div>
Bitcoin is the decentralized digital currency. I say &#8220;the,&#8221; rather than &#8220;a,&#8221; because there can only be one. Since decentralized digital currencies rely on computational power to  ensure security, the currency with the most computational power is the  most secure. If we ever found ourselves with more than one decentralized digital  currency, which ever one had more computational resources devoted to it  would be the most secure, and thus more people would trust it, and thus  more people would use it, and thus it would come to dominate and be the  only one. Bitcoin is that currency. (<a href="http://astrohacker.com/ahc/sister-alternative-different-species-bitcoins/">Previously</a>,  I argued that there could be a market of currencies. However, I now realize that, while there can be a market of currencies,  there can&#8217;t be more than one decentralized digital currency.) <br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why is it gaining traction?</span><br />
Bitcoin is useful for all the same reasons that any currency is useful:  it is a medium of exchange. The advantage of being decentralized is that you do not have to rely on a  third party for security. Thus, bitcoin is more useful than digital dollars for the same reason  that digital dollars are more useful than paper dollars, or paper  dollars are more useful than gold: it is just easier to pay people with  them. No banks means less headaches, in the same way that no gold means there  is a lot less weight you have to lug around. Bitcoin is thus a better answer to a problem humanity has been slowly  solving for millenia: how do we remove barriers to payment? <br />
<br />
There are other advantages to bitcoin too, besides being more  convenient. The fact that no central party party controls the supply means no  central party can inflate it to redistribute wealth in their favor. No one can debase bitcoin to pay for a war. Also, since it is deflationary (in the sense that prices reliably go  down), it encourages savings, because everyone gets richer that way. <br />
<div style="font-weight: bold;">
<br />
Exponential growth</div>
Certainly, then, bitcoin is a candidate for an economic singularity,  because everyone has incentives to use it, and it makes the world a  better place. That&#8217;s great in theory, but the reason why it cleary actually is a  singularity is because its adoption is, in fact, growing exponentially. There are at least two exponential curves we can see. One is <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=bitcoin">Google Trends</a>, where bitcoin has crystal clear exponential growth. And another is <a href="http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#vztgSzm1g10zm2g25">its value in USD</a>, where again the growth is clearly exponential. Although these quantities are not the same thing as adoption, they are probably proportional to adoption. 2.5 years ago, there was one user of bitcoin. We may estimate that there are somewhere between 10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> users of bitcoin at present. Thus, in another 2.5 years, there will be somewhere between 10<sup>8</sup> and 10<sup>10</sup> users. Since there aren&#8217;t even 10<sup>10</sup> people on the planet, we may estimate that adoption will be ubiquitous in approximately three years. <br />
<div style="font-weight: bold;">
<br />
Attack vectors</div>
This incredibly rapid exponential growth is being powered by the fact  that people around the world are quickly learning about it. Thus, the exponential growth can only last until it saturates the world,  at which point it will continue growing only at the rate that humanity  grows (which is also exponential, but much slower). At present, there is no reason to think the growth will stop before  that. There are no credible attack vectors at all; not even government (the US  government or any other) can stop it, because the economic incentives  are too large. A War on Bitcoin would have exactly as much efficacy as the War on  Drugs: none. Bitcoin is susceptible to DOS attacks, but that would only slow its  growth, not stop it. The only credible threat to bitcoin is quantum computers, because  bitcoin relies on classical, rather than quantum, cryptography. But that threat is many years away. Bitcoin will be ubiquitous by then. <br />
<div style="font-weight: bold;">
<br />
What will happen?</div>
Bitcoin will take over as the currency of the internet. It will also take over as a store of value; why earn a measly,  less-than-inflation interest rate in a savings account when you can have  steady appreciation of value if you just keep your money in bitcoin? People will spend less and save more because they know if only they do  that, they will be richer in the future. Companies will no longer produce things of no value, because no one will  buy them. The world will become more efficient, because there will be less waste. Everyone will realize how much they lose by spending money on valueless  things. There will be a more equitable distribution of wealth, because no one  can inflate (or, to use a less charitable term, counterfeit) bitcoin at  their whim. <br />
<br />
Bitcoin will also take over any fiat currencies that inflate too rapidly  (think Zimbabwe, Argentina, or any other country that presently has or  will have a rapidly inflating currency). Central banks will be under enormous pressure to stabilize their  currencies or become obsolete. Many banks will collapse. Many fiat currencies will become worthless. Probably, all fiat currencies will become worthless eventually, because  it is only a matter of time before the central banks fall into the  temptation of inflating their currencies just a bit too fast. <br />
<div style="font-weight: bold;">
<br />
How to proceed</div>
Since bitcoin appreciates in value very rapidly during the  singularity phase, you should convert all of your liquid assets to  bitcoin as quickly as possible. Do not keep any cash, savings, or checking beyond what you need to pay  for goods and services that cannot yet be paid for with bitcoin. The more things you can buy with bitcoin, the more bitcoin you should  keep. <br />
<br />
Stop wasting money on excessively expensive meals, televisions, cars, and anything else that loses value quickly or instantly. Instead, put your money into bitcoin. You will be much richer that way. You may think having less stuff is less fun, but actually the pleasure of financial freedom far, far outweighs any losses. <br />
<br />
During the singularity phase, you should also take out loans to buy  bitcoin, since bitcoin appreciates far more rapidly than interest on any  fiat currency loan. When bitcoin gets near saturation, which is the end of the singularity,  you should pay off the loans, because at that point the rate of  appreciation will probably be a lot closer to the interest on the loans,  and you may not be able to reliably earn money that way anymore. <br />
<br />
You may also be tempted to convert other assets to bitcoin. If you are invested in anything that is likely to be bitcoin-unfriendly,  like a bank, it would be wise to convert those assets into bitcoin. However, if you are invested in companies that actually produce value,  those companies will thrive after the singularity, so it is not  necessarily a good idea to convert those assets to bitcoin.<br />
<br />
If you own assets where the ownership of those assets is certified by  a country that is likely to collapse after the singularity, such as if  you owned land in a country where the currency is rapidly inflating, you  should consider converting those assets to bitcoin, or risk losing it  when your country&#8217;s government collapses.<br />
<br />
If you own a business, you should start accepting bitcoin as quickly  as possible to maximize your ownership of the bitcoin economy. If you don&#8217;t own a business, consider starting a bitcoin business. See my <a href="http://astrohacker.com/ahc/time-is-now-for-bitcoin-entrepreneurship">previous post</a> to learn more about bitcoin startups. <br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</span><br />
The economy is going to change very dramatically in a matter of three or  so years. You are likely to be doing a significant amount, if not all, of your  economic activity in bitcoin very soon. The change will be as dramatic as, say, computing or the internet,  except that it will happen much faster. The change will be for the better, since it is more convenient to use  bitcoin than fiat currencies for digital payments. Fiat currencies may stick around if they do not hyperinflate; they will  probably still be useful for buying coffee. The most interesting change is that we will all become more motivated  and productive, since we will see very clearly how our work ethic  affects how rich we are. And the world as a whole will be significantly more efficient, since it  will be extremely difficult to finance huge wastes of money, like wars. <br />
<br />
Personally, I have invested most of my savings into bitcoin, and am  in the process of figuring out precisely how much more it is wise to  invest. I have not yet taken out any loans to buy bitcoin, because that decision  is too hard to swallow (I may yet do it if I can stomach it&#8212;<a href="http://falkvinge.net/2011/05/29/why-im-putting-all-my-savings-into-bitcoin/">Falkvinge did</a>.) I  have also begun producing bitcoin businesses which I am hoping will  support me after I graduate. (My bitcoin savings alone will actually probably be enough to support  me, but I will be richer if I work too.) Most of the other ideas I had about what to do with my life after  graduation have gone into the toilet&#8212;I will probably do something with  bitcoin. <br />
<br />
In the future, books that summarize the history of money will have a line that says, &#8220;and then came bitcoin.&#8221; It is the economic singularity. And we are living in it now. <br />
