		<p>Your ultimate Bitcoin calculator. Never again will you have to look at other mining calculators, profitability calculators, power calculators or generation calculators. See how much your Bitcoin mining rig can earn you today!</p>
		<h2>What is "Bitcoin"?</h2>
		<p>Bitcoin is a new form of digital currency unlike any that was ever created. It is to PayPal like gold is to a traditional currency. It relies on mathematics of cryptography and the combined calculating power of many computers to secure your savings against anyone wanting to take it away.</p>
		<p>For more on Bitcoins, check out <a href="http://www.weusecoins.com/">WeUseCoins</a>.</p>
		<h2>What is "mining"?</h2>
		<p>Mining is a process of generating new Bitcoins by solving a mathematical problem. By mining you let your computer generate pseudo-random numbers according to certain rules, and if your random number is small enough, you solve a Block, and get to keep a reward associated with it.</p>
		<p>For more on mining, check out <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining">Wiki - Mining</a>.</p>
		<h2>How do I start mining?</h2>
		<p>
			Best way to get your feet wet with mining, is to do the following:<br>
			-Join a mining pool, like <a href="http://mining.bitcoin.cz/">Slush's Pool</a> .<br>
			-Download a mining software, like the <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=3878.0">GUI Miner</a>.<br>
			-Using the credentials from the pool, configure your miner and click "Start mining".<br>
			It's that easy! Now you can let your computer earn money for you!
		</p>
		<h2>What do I do then?</h2>
		<p>
			After you let your computer crunch the numbers for awhile, you should look into either transferring them to your Wallet, or selling them for real money.<br>
			-In order to get your own Wallet, download the Bitcoin Client from here - <a href="http://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin.org</a>.<br>
			-As that might be a bit of a hassle at times, you might consider using an online Wallet, like <a href="https://strongcoin.com/">StrongCoin</a>.<br>
			-If you want to sell your Bitcoins, you should check out an exchange, like <a href="https://mtgox.com/">MtGox</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>How much money can I earn?</h2>
		<p>
			Well, this is what this whole website is for! In just a few easy steps you can see how much money you can earn:<br>
			-<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison">Find out what hardware you have, note the <b>Mhash/s</b> value.</a><br>
			-<a href="http://tpbitcalc.appspot.com/">Input that value in our calculator as <b>Hash Rate</b>.</a><br>
			-Click <b>Calculate</b>
			And there you have it, all the data you need to get started!
		</p>
		<h2>How do I earn more?</h2>
		<p>The answer to that question is both easy and hard - if you want to mine more Bitcoins, you need to get more <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison">hardware</a>, which can be a bit daunting at times. But hey, you can make a pretty decent living by making your computers work for you this way!:)</p>
		<h2>What is a Bitcoin Mining Calculator anyway?</h2>
		<p>A mining calculator (also known as a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Generation_Calculator">generation calculator</a>) is a simple piece of software that can calculate how much Bitcoins your computer can mine. Based on your Hash Rate and the current Difficulty it can approximate how much Bitcoins you can expect to see being generated.</p>
		<h2>What is a Bitcoin Power Calculator?</h2>
		<p>A power calculator (or <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Power_Calc">power calc</a> for short) calculates how much it costs for your computer to generate Bitcoins, based on the price of electricity and the power consumption of your computer.</p>
		<h2>What is a Bitcoin Profitability Calculator?</h2>
		<p>A <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Profitability_Calculator">profitability calculator</a> calculates how much actual money your computer can generate (taking a current exchange rate from a Bitcoin exchange).</p>
		<h2>How does this website fit in all this?</h2>
		<p>This website is one of the few websites that offers a complex solution to all of the above calculating problems in a neat, readable little package. It is a mining power and profitability calculator all in one. By entering just a few basic pieces of information you can learn all you want to know (and some things you didn't know you wanted to know) from a simple table. You can estimate how much money you can earn with a new mining rig, when your investment will be returned and many more, without having to go back and forth between multiple websites!</p>
		<h2>Thanks, I love this site! How can I help?</h2>
