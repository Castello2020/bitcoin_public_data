Your master password is never shared with LastPass.

User styles empower your browsing experience by letting you customize web sites. Take out irrelevant content, change colors, or completely redesign the entire site. You can even use user styles as themes on the interface of Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey themselves.

Stylish lets you easily manage user styles. Add, delete, enable, disable, and organize with a few clicks of a mouse, no code to edit, no obscure configuration to find. Stylish's companion website, &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/76374e85d2e814e19408c9d3b3617798bf666a44/http%3A//userstyles.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;userstyles.org&lt;/a&gt;, hosts tens of thousands of user styles made by other Stylish users that you can try.

For you technical types out there, think of it this way: Stylish and &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/76374e85d2e814e19408c9d3b3617798bf666a44/http%3A//userstyles.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;userstyles.org&lt;/a&gt; are to CSS as Greasemonkey and &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/15b9fa0fe1920f09bd1c69eea79f7043cbb8dcb6/http%3A//userscripts.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;userscripts.org&lt;/a&gt; are to JavaScript.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jason Barnabe</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 16:05:46 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/stylish/versions/1.4.3</guid></item><item><title>Lightweight Themes Switcher 1.0</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/lightweight-themes-switcher/</link><description></description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Sriram Ramasubramanian</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2013 17:09:41 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/lightweight-themes-switcher/versions/1.0</guid></item><item><title>Mobile Password Manager 1.0.1</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/mobile-password-manager/</link><description>This add-on allows you to view and edit saved passwords in both Firefox for Android and desktop Firefox.

On Android, it is accessed by pressing the menu button, then choosing "Saved Passwords", or by long pressing a password field on any web page. On a desktop, it can be launched from Tools -&amp;gt; Options.

Although it can run on pretty much any device, this add-on is designed for touchscreens. On a desktop with a mouse and keyboard, I recommend using Daniel Dawson's excellent &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/saved-password-editor/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Saved Password Editor&lt;/a&gt; instead.

For example, if you type google.con, it will correct it to &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/105ab463e59c21c54f68a28f8c587f40731596c2/http%3A//google.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;google.com&lt;/a&gt; (asking first, if you enable confirmation).

This version will correct common misspellings of .com, .net, .org, .edu, .gov, .mil, and all other mainstream TLDs, as well as the protocol (http:, https:).  By right-clicking on the address bar, you can set it to auto-correct your errors, or you can have it ask you before making any corrections.

You can specify your own set of custom corrections. Add or remove your own corrections in URL Fixer's options dialog, accessible via Tools » Add-ons » URL Fixer » Preferences.

You can also correct errors as they happen; if Firefox can't find the website you typed in, URL Fixer lets you mark that URL as a typo, and you'll never see that error page again.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Wladimir Palant</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Oct 2012 20:20:01 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/url-fixer/versions/4.1</guid></item><item><title>Cloud Viewer 2.1</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/cloud-viewer/</link><description>View PDF, DOC, XLS and PPT files without downloading them to your device.

So, this extension was made for those of us who don't care about all that stuff but does about just getting rid of all the nasty resources being loaded by websites.

This is a lightweight extension (ie, 30KB compared to ~700KB of other popular adblockers), which was made with performance in mind. No configurable options, subscriptions, additional features, etc It just block what can go to hell ;-)

How this is achieved is thanks to &lt;i&gt;just seven&lt;/i&gt; hard-coded blocking rules covering about 8400 .com and .net domains, these were auto-generated from Easylist. That means, every time a certain resource wants to be loaded we will have to iterate through a list of seven compiled patterns, rather than for each entry from a common Easylist which contains hundreds of different items to check... You can now figure things out for yourself...

Next i'll let you decide if this is for you... as long performance is in your mind, it should.

You can turn the extension on/off at any time by clicking the toolbar button (Fx Desktop), or touching the menu item entry (Fx for Android)</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Diego Casorran</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2014 17:18:53 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/bluhell-firewall/versions/2.3.0</guid></item><item><title>Goal.com Feed 1.0</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/goalcom-feed/</link><description>&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/a838c500749a5c5b264a561852b172bb4064c08f68d63964c3c9e7a5aa0b2770/http%3A//Goal.com"&gt;Goal.com&lt;/a&gt; is the definitive source for football news from around the world and you can get the latest action directly on your Firefox for Android homescreen.   Football, soccer, futbol, calcio, futebol - whatever you call it and whoever you support, we are your definitive football source.
