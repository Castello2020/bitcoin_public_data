<p>We, who read the news are still coming to terms with the tragic killings of six innocent people and one suicide in Southern California Friday night. I read much of what is being called the Manifesto of Elliot Rodgers. Elliot was very ill, and had been chronically in a state of paranoid hysteria since his teen years. Elliot was also a very good writer. His utility of the language was quite sophisticated for someone his age. When I hear the term &#39;Manifesto&#39;, I naturally think of the ugliest one; Mein Kampf, which is almost back to back rationalized hatred, egoism and institutionalized bigotry. It is a closely focused and heavy handed collection of propaganda. When I read Elliot Rodgers &#39;Manifesto&#39; There was definitely a large amount of hatred being expressed, for himself and others. However, there was also a first person narrative, using his &#39;authors&#39; voice. Rodgers described in great detail the types of environments that made up what was called his life from age 5 onto past 21 years. Rodgers expressed closeness to his family, but also expected them to constantly provide for his needs. Even though many of Elliot&#39;s favorite memories with his family were centered around Christmas holiday gatherings, I was struck that there was no direct reference to religion at all in his family. <p> Not all families are religious, I&#39;m not going to pretend that I&#39;m surprised. However, in light of all that has occured, this lack of spirituality in the family is all the more unfortunate. It seems no one ever told or hinted to Elliot that life is often easier to bear if you can have faith in more than just yourself and in other people. Rodger&#39;s bio mother is from an Asian country. That part of the world has a history full of religious and spiritual faiths. There are some areas that practice Buddhism, Shinto, Christianty, Tao and Zen. I understand some people become focused on the job of survival and simply don&#39;t pencil in any deep observations based on the ephemerals of what is to them unproved beliefs. <p> Elliot was caught something of a Peter Pan syndrome, a Toys R Us, not wanting to grow up, and not really being expected to until he was about 20. By then, both parents had gotten their fill of his selfish, greedy ways. Neither parent wanted him living with them full time. So what may be a downside to being reared in a somewhat wealthy family, is that you can become obsessed with matters of the inner world very easily. <p>I was struck by how extreme his elitism became. Some would say his bigotry. &quot;How could those girls pick this guy, the descendant of slaves, when they should be picking me, the descendant of English royalty?&quot; His audacity was astounding. If the ending wasn&#39;t so horrifically tragic and life altering, it would hold a certain brand of black humor. However, Elliot was not joking, and part of the problem was that he tool everything, including himself way too seriously. It&#39;s unfortunate that his &#39;Manifesto&#39; is out there now, fully available to download online. All the family business is an open book during those times. Here is a feature of irony; Peter Rodger; Elliot&#39;s dad, produced and directed a film in 2009 called &quot;What Does God Mean?&quot; where he spent 3 years traveling around the world collecting short interviews with stars and celebrities asking them what &quot;God&quot; meant to them. Participants included Ringo Starr and The actor who starred in Wolverine. The movie sunk like a stone, bankrupting Peter and setting him back financially for many years. The Hunger Games was his most recent, lucrative work as assistant director. Elliot describes that time as &quot;I was embarrassed at dad telling everyone about his financial troubles&quot;. No empathy for the dad was expressed. People seem to forget all the useful life lessons in morality young children can learn from religious instruction. They may chose not to do the right thing later on in life, but they do very much know the difference between right and wrong.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <p>These evil murderers are not trained in curbing their sinful nature under the tutelage of the Holy Spirit through the Word of God from their infant years. They do not &#8220;walk with God,&#8221; as the Bible describes it&#133;a life-long process of denying self and conforming to &#8220;the mind of Christ.&#8221;</p>
<p>Modern secularism is impotent in curbing the spiritual birth defect of original sin. This should be obvious in observing the current disastrous harvest of malevolent killers that we are reaping after our schools and homes have banned the teachings of the Bible.</p>

    There was no mention of God because Rodgers was simply acting out an extreme version of what took place in the Garden of Eden: Man <i><b>turns his attention from God</b></i> to a goddess (woman), looking for emotional attachment and validation, a sort of emotional vampirism searching for meaning not from the metaphysical but from natural (flawed and betraying) people to assure the pride in his misperception of himself and satisfy the emptiness which can only be resided by the supernatural. Eden went like this:<p> God gets lonely.<p> God makes the serpent.<p> The serpent betrays God.<p> God makes man.<p> Man gets lonely.<p> God makes woman.<p> Man betrays God and worships woman instead.<p> Woman betrays man and worships the serpent.<p> Then lonely man reconciles with lonely God who hugs him back and says, &quot;I know bro.&quot;<p>
 <p> Women lose respect for men when they set them on a pedestal to worship the way Rodgers did when he should have been staying focused on his relationship with the supernatural. When woman becomes your whole world (your god) she subconsciously resents that you have thrown the cosmic hierarchy of nature out of balance. The hierarchy goes down in authority from God - Man - Woman - Child. Nature&#39;s structure demands man to stand between God and woman and pull her up as she in turn pulls the children up behind her. When man miscues this sequence of function by letting his attention and affection turn from God by getting down on his knees before a woman (a body language of submission and weakness, not alpha dog) and tells her she is his whole life (a mantra the belongs to God), she secretly resents having to assume not just a man&#39;s role, not just a mother of a man-baby role, but the role of god. Women can instinctively read this dysfunctional energy simply by the look in your eye. That&#39;s why Rodgers could never establish a relationship. I believe it happened because Rodgers was emotionally traumatized as a child through neglect and rejection, a cycle that snowballed until poor Elliot was no longer Elliot. He had opened a porthole to hell and a heartless monster took his place. &quot;<i>I live in the weak and the wounded.&quot;</i> The hell we people cause each other.

THIS must make the University quite proud of being able to produce such perfect men, such genteleman. I wonder what grades he got in school.

    <p>I skimmed through the manifesto last night and watched two thirds of one of his youtube videos (another that I had tried to look at was removed by youtube).</p>
<p>The manifesto was written by a well-educated privileged kid who had some severe mental issues. He perceived that girls would have nothing to do with him, but that they would choose other guys, whom he perceived as more handsome, gifted, etc. He obsessed about girls constantly, but did not want anything to do with them. He went to an all-boys Catholic high school for a time, until his lack of effort led to him being dismissed from the school. At that time, he had to attend a public high school, which was utter agony since girls also attended the school.</p>
<p>The severe mental imbalances he exhibited would not, I am certain, have been cured by a strong belief in God. He needed psychiatric attention.</p>

    <p>To be honest a lot of this was foreseeable. I actually read most of his ramblings. He reflects fondly on his youth, then at the age of 5-6 his parents divorce and he jumps between the two of them. The first problem arises when his step mother arrives on the scene.</p>
<p>Basically when he stays with his mother she gives him anything he wants, spends on him lavishly, essentially lets him do whatever he wants. His step mother... not so much. It&#8217;s pretty clear reading between the lines that she probably thought he was spoiled and rude, and this does not sit well with him, and establishes a long pattern of behavior.</p>
<p>Interestingly, although his dad appears to be around a bit, he&#8217;s mentioned mainly in passing, as if he had little real interaction with his son.</p>

    <p>the father Peter Rodgers is (was?) an arrogant patronizing liberal, scornful of religion and &#8220;God&#8221;, equating George Bush&#8217;s faith in God (purported as his reason to invade Iraq in countless leftwing blogs) to that of al Qaeda&#8217;s faith in &#8220;god&#8221; as an excuse to fly planes into the WTC and Petagon</p>
<p>There are Youtube videos of this pretentious schmuck being interviewed several years ago by gushing sycophants, as he talks about his movie &#8220;Oh My God&#8221; which set out to mock scorn and discredit believers of all faiths. While Peter Rodger was traveling the world on this project to mock faith in God, his son was devolving into insanity in solitude, with the pastime of violent video games.</p>

<p>&#8220;The anti-Christian voice is from Bob Geldof, a musician most well known for organizing Live Aid in the 1980s. Through bleeped profanity, Geldof delivers the sentiments of a mocker who says there is no God, yet seems oddly angry at someone who, according to him, doesn&#146;t exist.&#8221;</p>

    <p>News flash! (From an older generation to the younger generation)</p>
<p>The guy was a fruitcake or as we used to say &#8220;odd&#8221;. They existed when we were that age. We, not being so stupid as to believe all the equality crap and sissy stuff preached today, knew such people were mentally unstable and unpredictable in their interactions with other people and society. We made our own evaluation - friend or foe.</p>
<p>We looked a guy in the &#8220;&#8221;eye&#8221;. And from his reaction we knew how serious he was. The mildly serious we kidded. Others, we could sense would not hesitate to &#8220;squash us like a bug&#8221;. It was the latter reaction we carefully evaluated to determine if they were &#8220;putting us on&#8221;. If they weren&#8217;t, we avoided them as they say &#8220;like the Plague&#8221; because &#8220;they were for real&#8221;.</p>
<p>You can still do this today. Look into the eyes of any of the mass murderers like the Sandy Lake guy and you will get my drift. Ask teachers, how many of them can look into little &#8220;Johnny&#8217;s&#8221; eyes and actions and tell you he is headed for the state pen or worse, maybe even a liberal political future :).</p>
<p>Factor in the mind altering drugs and you have a bunch of crazies walking around on either side. My generation believed in institutionalizing such people for their own &#8220;safety&#8221; and to &#8220;protect&#8221; society. But in our new &#8220;progressive&#8221; society there are few institutions left and he has the &#8220;right&#8221; to be as crazy as he wants to be.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fn36l_z3WY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fn36l_z3WY</a></p>
<p>Maybe early on, if somebody had have opened a few cans of &#8220;whoop ass&#8221;, maybe this guy&#8217;s attitude would have changed and he could have become somebody&#8217;s best friend. (or boy friend or something). Maybe six innocent people would not be dead.</p>

    <p>It is my own theory based on patterns of aloneness observed in the garden story relevant to the Rodgers manifesto. The issue I&#8217;m bringing up isn&#8217;t so much about God&#8217;s aloneness, (which I do believe inclined the Father to create us), but about the folly of man&#8217;s weakness for corporeal bonding which lead Elliot to do what he did. What&#8217;s your theory of what motivated God to make humans?</p>

    Google/YouTube removed the video, claiming: <blockquote>This video has been removed as a violation of YouTube&#39;s policy on violence. </blockquote>

    <p>Thank you for that actual title; &#8220;Oh My God&#8221;, was the work. I was up in the wee hours posting, and I couldn&#8217;t recall the name of his movie. He had expected this movie to be his big breakthrough and was flummoxed when it flopped. I&#8217;ve never heard anything of it pro or con. At the very least, he had poor publicists.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m all thumbs online except for the basics, but I&#8217;ve heard once something is online, it&#8217;s very difficult to completely pull it out &#8216;by the roots&#8217;. People could and probably did Screen-Save those incrimminating Youtubes. The police will be looking like chumps to have let this boy go because he was, how did they put it? &#8220;A polite and wonderful human&#8221; wow.Really?</p>

    <p>I don&#8217;t think media will approach this story that way, as the Rodgers were not known to be particularly religious except for Christmas and Easter banquets. Those mansion based dinners were often more a matter of public relations vs any direct expression of faith.</p>
<p>What many will zero in on is how did he get all those guns. Who, if anyone helped him. It&#8217;s far easier to blame the faceless NRA monolith instead of naming other factors where individual would be cupable, like his &#8216;team&#8217; of psychiatrists and social counselors. Why did none of them know of his potential danger.</p>
<p>I neglected to add in my article, that Elliot Rodgers had written that it was common for him to send OVER FOURTEEN HOURS a DAY playing WORLDS OF WAR ONLINE, and others such as Halo. Some boys can play these games, have fun, then walk back into the satisfying reality of their own lives, Elliot could not. His mother indulged him, and allowed him to spend almost every waking hour online playing war games. This surely served to stunt his emotional maturity.</p>

Yes, it&#8217;s all around us if we look. Innocent bystanders murdered by demon possessed individuals, 50+ million unborn babies aborted/murdered by their own mothers, doctors who pledge to &#8220;first do no harm&#8221; but choose to &#8220;kill not heal&#8221; for the convenience of society, judges who pledge &#8220;justice&#8221; but fail to defend our laws and the Constitution authored by godly men, people who pledge allegiance to one nation &#8220;under GOD&#8221; but reject HIS authority, police that pledge to &#8220;serve and protect&#8221; but only exert their authority, public schools that have removed daily prayer and biblical references from the lives of our children, the political correctness and acceptance of homosexuality and same sex marriages, and a government for the people which rejects the will of the people.</p>
<p>To the heathen liberal, this world is their &#8220;Heaven&#8221;. But to the GOD-fearing conservative it is knowing &#8220;Hades&#8221; does exist and Jesus now holds the keys. We also know there is a &#8220;Heaven&#8221; for those redeemed by the blood of Jesus.</p>
