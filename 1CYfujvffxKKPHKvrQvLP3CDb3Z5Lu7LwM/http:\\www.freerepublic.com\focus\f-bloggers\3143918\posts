<p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-t--D_DKd8SE/U0q216MQgbI/AAAAAAABI1s/JjnME6dI_V0/s1600-h/range-war%25255B4%25255D.png"><img alt="range-war" border="0" height="304" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-h9rHlI3mT0U/U0q22hLuNjI/AAAAAAABI10/zFSTtvaQ_B8/range-war_thumb%25255B7%25255D.png?imgmax=800" title="range-war" width="604" /></a><p>Hopefully your Saturday night and Palm Sunday morning activities have given you enough perspective to join me for a brief recap of the attempted federal land grab at the Bundy Ranch and the showdown at the NV Corral. You&#146;ve undoubtedly heard the story by now of how the Bureau of Land Management attempted to evict Clive Bundy and his cows from the family&#146;s centennial ranch (two second argument: tortoise trumps cows; because we said so). And now they&#146;ve backed down, with an agreement that results in the slaughter of Bundy&#146;s cows, for which he will receive half the proceeds. That&#146;s, at least theoretically, a win for the good guys.<p>Now, here&#146;s the <em>rest</em> of the story: (h/t <a href="http://www.infowars.com/breaking-sen-harry-reid-behind-blm-land-grab-of-bundy-ranch/"><strong>Infowars</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://danaloeschradio.com/the-real-story-of-the-bundy-ranch/"><strong>Dana Loesch</strong></a>)<ol>
  <li>The Bureau of Land Management, whose director was Sen. Harry Reid&#146;s (D-Nev.) <a href="http://lasvegas.cbslocal.com/2014/04/09/nevadan-named-blm-chief/"><strong>former senior adviser</strong></a>, has purged documents from its web site stating that the agency wants Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy&#146;s cattle off of the land his family has worked for over 140 years in order to make way for solar panel power stations, or turtles. Or something. (more additional info<strong> <a href="http://www.infowars.com/breaking-sen-harry-reid-behind-blm-land-grab-of-bundy-ranch/">here</a></strong>) <em>&#147;Back in 2012, the New American reported that Harry Reid&#146;s son, Rory Reid, was the chief representative for a Chinese energy firm </em><a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/energy/item/12730-harry-reid-bolsters-son%E2%80%99s-interests-in-chinese-solar-plant-deal"><strong><em>planning to build a $5-billion solar plant on public land in Laughlin, Nevada</em></strong></a><strong><em>.&#148;</em></strong><li><em>Some</em><strong> </strong>people claim that what Harry really wants are <strong><a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2014/04/bundy_ranch_the_federal_government_and_the_nevada_water_tipping_point.html">the water rights, to divert to all his friends in Vegas</a></strong>, baby!<li>The stated reason for the land grab by the BLM was to protect a <strong><a href="http://danaloeschradio.com/the-real-story-of-the-bundy-ranch/">the desert tortoise - that is now so populous that the government is euthanizing them.</a></strong><li>Although widely reported that Clive Bundy<strong> </strong><a href="http://danaloeschradio.com/the-real-story-of-the-bundy-ranch/"><strong>has not paid fees for use of his land</strong></a><strong>,</strong> that isn&#146;t quite accurate. He just hasn&#146;t paid what the BLM thinks he should.</ol>
 <p>Last week hundreds of supporters (deemed the &#147;militia&#148; by the MSM, &#147;armed anarchists&#148; by others) showed up on the disputed land. Fevers were running high and anything might have happened.&nbsp; That is, prior to news of Harry Reid&#146;s possible connections began to leak. Then, suddenly the Sherriff was able to work out a resolution with Clive, allowing the BLM armored division to back off.<p align="center"><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-HcLskFGu3HY/U0q23Xq2cII/AAAAAAABI18/UCv_OPtWaQk/s1600-h/web1_tresspasscattle_040514JL_01_14%25255B3%25255D.jpg"><img alt="web1_tresspasscattle_040514JL_01_14" border="0" height="350" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-PndCvKj2MdI/U0q23-4Tc7I/AAAAAAABI2E/sVF3WVxb2LA/web1_tresspasscattle_040514JL_01_14_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" title="web1_tresspasscattle_040514JL_01_14" width="554" /></a><strong><em>BLM snipers on BLM helicopter</em></strong><p>I&#146;m guessing the hostage negotiations were amicably settled for one of several reasons:<ol>
  <li>Barry didn&#146;t want to be the second black President with blood on his hands.<li>Ricky didn&#146;t want to be the first black Attorney General with blood on his hands.<li>Harry told them to back down, as the subsequent investigation would result in a midterm&nbsp; bloodbath.</ol>
 <p>The last time a story got a little too close to examining just why people call him &#147;Dirty&#148; Harry, <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/13/fbi-blocked-in-corruption-probe-involving-sens-rei/?page=all"><strong>the Feds also withdrew the complaint</strong></a>. Makes you wonder how many pictures, of whom, he has in private dossier.<p align="center"><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/13/fbi-blocked-in-corruption-probe-involving-sens-rei/?page=all" title="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/13/fbi-blocked-in-corruption-probe-involving-sens-rei/?page=all"><img alt="harry reid wtf" border="0" height="531" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-oPtI_pM2DlE/U0q24fOsaHI/AAAAAAABI2M/vHgDT40lOyU/harry%252520reid%252520wtf%25255B8%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" title="harry reid wtf" width="454" /></a><strong><em>&#147;Go ahead punk, make my day.&#148;</em></strong><p>So I think you&#146;re pretty much up to speed now. When the story started to zero in on Democrat-nerve central, it had to be killed. Same as the cattle that the Feds have already rounded up from the Bundy ranch. Don&#146;t worry though, they&#146;re going to split the proceeds of the slaughter with the Bundy family, which is mighty generous of them, given all the trouble they&#146;ve gone through &#150; the Feds, I mean.<p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-jAveYl1kGvM/U0q25QkUoUI/AAAAAAABI2U/FLpAfcZFe_A/s1600-h/192131_5_%25255B3%25255D.png"><img alt="192131_5_" border="0" height="368" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-rzmSBHi6kq0/U0q259sMIsI/AAAAAAABI2c/pWnvg89lG38/192131_5__thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800" title="192131_5_" width="454" /></a><p>Anyway, this is certainly an interesting little story, butt there&#146;s a much bigger, more interesting <strong><a href="http://freebeacon.com/issues/last-man-standing/">story that has been pretty much ignored in MSM.</a></strong><blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>A two-decades-old battle between a Nevada rancher and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has resulted in officials armed with machine guns surrounding the ranch and forcibly removing the owner&#146;s cattle, according to the rancher&#146;s family.</em></strong></blockquote>
 <p>It&#146;s one of those what-in-the-world is going on here storie: how is it that the Bureau of Land Management came to have <strong>armored</strong> vehicles and agents <strong>armed</strong> with <strong>military style</strong> arms in order to deal with trespassers on their national turtle refuge? If they want to evict someone occupying their land they should have to call the Sherriff - whose job is to enforce the law - just like everybody else. If the Sherriff needs backup, they call in the FBI - whose job is also to uphold the law. As far as I know, the Bureau of Land Management&#146;s job is to, well, &#147;<strong><a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en.html">manage the land</a></strong>&#148; not scorch it.<p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-8sdtv4Ei9Mw/U0q26gAAVnI/AAAAAAABI2k/d5hnHlAPe4Q/s1600-h/Screenshot%252520Studio%252520capture%252520%2525231885%25255B4%25255D.png"><img alt="Screenshot Studio capture #1885" border="0" height="352" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-7vea55gppXs/U0q27fWpo0I/AAAAAAABI2s/5ypZkoavZNI/Screenshot%252520Studio%252520capture%252520%2525231885_thumb%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800" title="Screenshot Studio capture #1885" width="604" /></a><p>I don&#146;t see anything in BLM&#146;s mission statement about protecting the Constitution (obviously), upholding the law, or forcing evictions. And yet, here they are, with <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/blogging-citizen-journalism/2014/04/range-war-now-they-set-up-blm-designated-first-amendment-zone-in-clark-county-nevada-2452274.html"><strong>armed agents, armored vehicles and &#147;low-flying&#148; helicopters to round up a rancher&#146;s cattle.</strong></a> What&#146;s wrong with this picture?<p align="center"><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-K1KX4dNp1es/U0q277jUMjI/AAAAAAABI20/ShU7vCkzh6o/s1600-h/first_amendment_area%25255B3%25255D.jpg"><img alt="first_amendment_area" border="0" height="404" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-DMWN4lm9WRE/U0q28sq4jII/AAAAAAABI28/sUdLsvIB-wY/first_amendment_area_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" title="first_amendment_area" width="604" /></a><strong><em>It&#146;s a constitutional right, not an &#147;area&#148;</em></strong><p>Now every administrative agency (emphasis on &#147;administrative&#148;) in the U.S. government gets to have it&#146;s own SWAT team.

<p>I pointed this out yesterday. The Feds don&#8217;t just send 250 armed agents into a sovereign state and take over a large tract of land and public highway, turn off cell towers and set up 1&#8217;st ammendment staging areas. It was bizarre to the extreme.</p>
<p>The only thing more troubling was that the Governor a so called republican didn&#8217;t send the staters to run them off.</p>

    The Federal Government has become to powerful and have taken all guarantees of freedom from all individual Americans.

    <p>I have no good feeling about our RINO Governor Nathan &#8220;Raw&#8221; Deal running the Feds off but most of our sheriffs would.</p>
<p>The Feds have come in here and staged little hit and run raids where they run up into the mountains and arrest someone and then take off before the Sheriff finds out about it.</p>
<p>If they tried an armed incursion here the sheriff&#8217;s would for the most part stand up and there would be a couple of thousand armed and PO&#8217;D rednecks to deal with not to mention the GA miliitia.</p>

    This is just the latest battle in the Federal governments War on Natural Resource Harvesters - begun in earnest in 1973 on Pacific West Coast commercial salmon fishermen by Nixon &amp; Co. We went to SCOTUS. We lost.<p> Klamath Falls, Oregon in 2001 was much the same battle as the Bundys; complete with armed Feds. They lost.<p> Then came San Joaquin Valley farmers a few years ago. No one noticed. They lost.<p> Many here might wonder why there is no general public outcry - beyond the MSN not or under reporting. The answer is simple: most people take their food supply for granted - the supermarket will always have food - and give it no other thought.<p> This War will continue until food is no longer harvested in the US; for some years now the US has been a net importer of food - this will only accelerate.<p> Some say it is about freedom - got news for you - that was lost when we lost in SCOTUS in 1978.<p> Some say it is about property rights - got news for you - that is also lost.<p> When the Federal Government controls the total food supply, all your guns, all your land will not feed you.<p> The Bundy battle is just another small bite, but they are starting to add up. The Federal Government can back off for now on the big battles, but they will continue the march in other directions, other venues where no one will notice.<p> It does not matter who supplies our health care, if there is no food to eat or only what the Federal Government decides to dole out.
