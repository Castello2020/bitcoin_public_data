hey whats going on nice pics
Bio.........................Yo Yo, My name is Erica, im 19, 5"3 ish about not sure anymore......so about me? umm...I think Im cool, pretty funny when I want to be, I love to sing and dance and all that garbage, going clubbing,hanging out with friends but then again who doesnt, I love music always listening to it, I listen to alot of punk and alternative but I'll listen to just about anything. Im a pretty complicated person to understand, but yet so simple if you just took the time to get to know me, I love to laugh and to make others laugh its a great feeling,I try my best to be the best friend you'll never have ...... Im really into crossbones and stuff I think its cool...I would love to learn how to play the guitar its some pretty cool shit if you ask me..I love the winter time cause I can go snowboarding and sking and stuff..Correction I dont love the winter time anymore cause I broke my leg pretty bad so I wont be able to do anymore snowboarding or skiing for lets say the rest of my life fun huh....but if I look on the bright side winter is fucking cold...anyways Im a big time nerd I like old school stuff like the power rangers! They are fucking awesome I used to play that shit when I was young..I was the yellow one it was cool. yeah I know Im a dork but what can you do?... I love the colors pink and black :) I have one bestfriend..not fifty million like most girls on this planet..Her name is JulieThis is Julie(candeekisses), my bestfriend..she's my life, I would be so lost without her , Love you forever I made this..this is me and Julie my bestfriend and pretty much my sister, when we were about 9 ish? yeah we were young but its so cute... there's more of me and her this is Julie my friend haha she's the shit, we dont talk much anymore which really sucks cause we were pretty close but we have different lives now but I hope she's doing well..

Most of you girls really have no idea what true love is, but believe me when you find it you'll know and you'll cherish it with all that you've got. I would give anything in the world for him and he would do the same ..oh and just to proove he's an amazing bf..he bought me a guinea pig just because I wanted one and we called him bacon..
