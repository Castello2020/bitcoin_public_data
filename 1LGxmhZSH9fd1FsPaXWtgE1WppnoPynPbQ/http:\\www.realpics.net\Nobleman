Hey, buddy. Been a while - again. Just checkin' up on you, I guess. Life is goot?
Nobleman's reply:Yeah, although lack of sleep caused by the baby is getting to me. Hopefully he starts sleeping through the night within the next month.

Harhar, very funny. I think you're going to have to prove it to me - I've just lost my taste when it comes to eating something that was sentient. ;p

LOL - That totally reminded me of the Noblecast. ;p I miss it!And, I meant that I didn't want to eat any of it.
Nobleman's reply:Then you've never had a well-prepared rotting corpse. I have some recipes that are absolutely delectable. You should try some. I've got a few corpses laying around that I could prepare.

BioMy profile has been out of date for years and I'm just too damned lazy to update it. So here it shall languish until I find a reason to put something silly and stupid that no one will care about in here.
