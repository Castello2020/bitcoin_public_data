LikesGo Yotes!I am McLovinO CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done; The ship has weather�d every rack, the prize we sought is won; The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting, While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring: But O heart! heart! heart! O the bleeding drops of red, Where on the deck my Captain lies, Fallen cold and dead. O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells; Rise up�for you the flag is flung�for you the bugle trills; For you bouquets and ribbon�d wreaths�for you the shores a-crowding; For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning; Here Captain! dear father! This arm beneath your head; It is some dream that on the deck, You�ve fallen cold and dead. My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still; My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will; The ship is anchor�d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done; From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won; Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells! But I, with mournful tread, Walk the deck my Captain lies, Fallen cold and dead.Something I wrote:Lied To MyselfI cant believe my own words anymoreIs it the pen that liesOr the hand that shakes as it writesWill my mind deceive my hand and fake what the pen createsI keep talking keep writing always thinkingBut I cant help but feelThe truth behind the wordsI lied to myselfPaper evidenceShakey hand, the middle manAnd a mind that creates such bitter lullabies
DislikesThe Disclaimer said:I don't mean to offend with this its just one of my random thoughts that pops in my head. Please try to find the good old humor in it and don't take it to heart. Thank youYou have to picture a gay Hitler with a lisp in order to find a trace of humor in this one:They say money is the root of all evil. That must mean that sales must be complete mayhem and if Hitler were alive today I'm sure he would say, "It was a 2 for 1 special and I just couldn't get enough."The Pink Hearts.
MusicI've got a fever, and the only perscription is... MORE COWBELL!! Postmark Twain, Making April, The Trouble Clefs, Between The Trees, The Sounds Of Animals Fighting, Paramore, Classic Case, Recover.Song of the momentA Verse Unsung :: Resolve To FightAll Rights Reserved, (c) 2007. ===========================Sometimes I sit and ponderOf all the fucked up things in my lifeCan't make them go awayAnd I'd be afraid(Yeah Ha! Alright!)I'll let you know how I could not surviveI finish up and walk right out the doorWhen every days the sameNot a dollar to my nameAnd they all waltz around with fantasy carsAnd dollar bills waving in my faceI could careless; I'm not impressedCuz all your smiles are the sameI've made mistakesWell I'm aliveThis is the life for meUntil the day I dieYou may be strong way down in lifeBut when the night is youngThe strong resolve to fightPick up the paper, shake my hand, and roll my eyesTurn on the televisionMy blood is getting thickSo I write tonightTo tell you about the things I can't explainAnd I wave goodbye; I'm not standing byTo let you take controlI've made mistakesWell I'm aliveThis is the life for meUntil the day I dieYou may be strong way down in lifeBut when the night is youngThe strong resolve to fightWe carry question through the nightWhen all the answers are denied (x2)Sometimes I sit and wonderOf all the fucked up things in this lifeI can't pretend I'm rightSo I say its fateFight, Fight, Fight, FightThe strong resolve to fight (x4)
