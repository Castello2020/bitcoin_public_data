<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc6"></A>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<p Align=justify>World economic order is increasingly changing. Emergence of
new economic power, democratization, falling of barriers between countries, are
all accelerating free trade. Domestic firms have been engaged into worldwide
business, increasing their profits, but at the same time, competing with other
firms. Marketing tools formerly tailored for domestic purpose are going
profound changes with adjustment to new environments. </p>
<p Align=justify>This international marketing must take into account the laws
of the home country, as well as that of the host countries in which the firms
operate. This is not obstacles free. According to Ricky Griffin et all, beside
supply factor and demand factor, political factor is the third factor
influencing foreign direct investments [1]. International relations are
influencing international marketing and vice versa. Thus, political risks may
emerge as serious barriers to Multinational companies (MNCs). However, those
effects are not out control of a well-trained international marketer.</p>
<p Align=justify>As world is assimilated to a global village, increasingly,
many MNCs are willing to invest in Africa in general and West Africa in
particular. So, it might be helpful to look for what kind of political risks
firms may face in West Africa? Our hypothesis is that political risks in West
Africa are both specific to that continent and also common to that of other
places. </p>
<p Align=justify>West African problem is that, African countries are not
investors' nations; they rarely invest in other countries. However, all of them
are host countries. So deal with only what investors countries should do will
yield bias to the debate. And so, to depict the actual situation and fit well
what is going on, there is necessity to focus on what investors should do to
avoid African government-induced political risks, and how those countries can
behave to preserve a safe business environment. </p>
<p Align=justify>   </p>
<p Align=justify>Under some ongoing structural reforms of ECOWAS and
UEMOA<sup>1<a name="fnref1"></a>(<A HREF="#fn1">*</A>)</sup>, what are business
opportunities in West Africa.? Also how the international marketer beside
political risks, can reach the market. In particular the present thesis aims to
review political risks in West Africa and to explore the link between country
political disturbances and the some international trade indicators like
production, import, exports, and so forth. Also some interactions between, and
possible causes of, political risks will be assess in the context of Africa.
After discussing those issues, some recommendations will be made accordingly.

<h4><A NAME="toc7"></A>      1. 1 Definitions</h4>

<p Align=justify><strong>                  1.1.1 Marketing:</strong> is the
process of planning and executing the conception, pricing, promotion, and
distribution of ideas, goods, and services to create exchanges that satisfy
individual and organizations objectives<sup>2<a name="fnref2"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn2">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>                  1.1.2 Marketing Mix</strong>: 
consists of the way a firm chooses to address product development, pricing,
promotion and distribution. Generally, it is admitted that marketing Mix
encompasses the 4P: Product, Pricing, Promotion and Place (distribution).
Often, two or more firms express share marketing services and expertise. This
is <strong>marketing alliance</strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>                 1.1.3 International marketing:
</strong>is the extension of marketing activities across national boundaries.
It involves firms trading in two or more countries. We may oppose domestic
marketing and international one.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc8"></A>1. 2. Differences between international and domestic
marketing </h2>

<p Align=justify>International marketing retains basis markets tenets of
&#171;satisfaction&#187; and &#171;exchange&#187;. The fact that in
international marketing, the transactions take places across national borders
highlights the difference between domestic and international marketing. </p>
<p Align=justify>The basic principles of marketing still apply, but their
applications, complexity, and intensity may vary substantially. Some
adjustments are necessary in international marketing context. For example, the
following figure shows the elements of marketing mix for international firms</p>

<p Align=justify>A company looking for improvement in its present position by
exploring market abroad, could do it only through international marketing
analysis and perspectives. International marketing have form ranging from
import-export trade to licensing, joint ventures, wholly owned subsidiaries,
turnkey operations and managements contracts. With international marketing
rather than domestic one, some specific approaches have been developed. The
approaches supply the answers of standardization and customization concerns.
</p>
<p Align=justify>We distinguish <strong>the ethnocentric approach </strong>that
is a managerial approach in which a firm operates internationally the same way
it does domestically. This approach avoids the expense of development of new
marketing product. It is generally used by some firms experiencing first
internationalization. Firm adopting this approach may fail because it does not
take into account the idiosyncratic needs of its foreign customers. Should
there be an attempt to adjust the firm's marketing mix to satisfy customers,
then we talk about <strong>polycentric approach. </strong>In this approach, the
corporate customizes its operations for each market it serves. Polycentric
approach is more costly. However, it may yield revenues, since it exactly meet
customers needs. Multidomestic international firms use to adopt this approach.
Finally, firm may choose the <strong>geocentric approach</strong>, in which a
firm analyses the needs of its customers worldwide and then adopts standardized
operating practices for all markets. There is a nuance between ethnocentric and
geocentric approaches. Both argue for standardization. However, the
ethnocentrism stagnate on the basis of what the firm does in its home country,
whereas geocentric starts with not such home country bias. Instead, the
geocentric approach considers the needs of all the firm's customers around the
world and then standardizes on that basis.</p>
<p Align=justify>How may the local ideas, goods, and services fit into the
international markets? May supplies be domestically-based or from abroad? What
are necessary adjustments the firm might do to overcoming global competition?
These are some issues the international marketing ought to deal with. In
addition, international marketing is subject to a new set of macro
environmental factors, to different constraint, to different laws, cultures and
societies. </p>


<h4><A NAME="toc9"></A>     1. 3.  International marketing environment</h4>

<p Align=justify>International marketer operating around the world encountered
various environment-related norms. The most critical environmental elements
able to shape international marketing activities are cultural, economic,
financial and political. [2] The last one, matter of the present thesis, will
be fully described in the next chapter. </p>


<h4><A NAME="toc10"></A>                  1.3.1. Cultural environment</h4>

<p Align=justify>The ways people appreciate manufactured items, express their
specific needs, and purchase, are deeply rooted in their culture. Culture
itself is a collection of values, beliefs, behaviors, customs, and attitudes
that distinguish and define a society. It is often said that culture is
learned, shared and transmitted from one generation to the next. Nevertheless,
in the context of international marketing, it seems not appropriate to learn a
culture, we have to live it. That is why Stephen Kobin [3] classified business
travel and assignment overseas as the top two factors considered critical and
important for culture knowledge. However, at least the factual knowledge of
culture can be learned and the interpretive one be acquired through
experience.</p>
<p Align=justify>International marketer needs both knowledges to master
language, religion, values and attitudes, manners and customs, aesthetics,
technology, education and social institutions, which all determine a given
culture. </p>
<p Align=justify>In business context, two schools of thought exist. One assumes
that business should prevail upon culture factors in marketing approach. The
other proposes that companies must tailor business approach to individual
culture. Also, for efficient managerial purpose, any international marketer
should consider any cultural aspects of a given society if this is the only way
to succeed there.</p>
<p Align=justify>In the case of Sub-Saharan Africa in general, and West Africa
in particular, cultural similarities (religion, language, tradition patterns,
high illiteracy...) are greater between countries. This psychological distance
factor could guide the manager willing to trade within West African countries.
</p>


<h4><A NAME="toc11"></A>                  1.3.2. Economic environment</h4>

<p Align=justify>            International marketing activities are favored by
appropriate economic environment. The secure economic environment could be
judged by the international marketer through some market's characteristics such
as population, income, consumption pattern, infrastructures, geography and
attitudes towards foreign investments. </p>
<p Align=justify>The population growth rate serves for estimation and active
population is the main source of labor a company may need. Markets require not
only people but also purchasing power, which is a function of income, prices,
savings, and credit availability. The share of income spent on products will
provide an indication of the market development level as well as an
approximation about how much money left for other purchases. So, information on
the percentage of households in a market that own a particulars product, allow
a further evaluation of market potential. The successful economic environment
involves the presence of basic economic infrastructures. They consist of
transportation (roads, railways, highways, and airports) the so-called linear
development, energy (water supply, electricity, oil, gas), and communications
systems (television, media, telephone, internet...).  </p>
<p Align=justify>Regional economic groupings are powerful factors an
international marketer should never neglect. In fact, economic integration in
world markets transactions poses unique opportunities and challenges for
corporate international marketing systems. Removing barriers between member
markets and erecting new ones for non members will call for adjustments in past
strategies to fully exploit the new situations. </p>
<p Align=justify>In West Africa, there are also several economic grouping, but
the most important are ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States), and
UEMOA (Union economique et Monetaire Ouest Africaine) we will further describe
in the second part of the thesis.</p>

<p Align=justify>           </p>
<p Align=justify>The international marketer should make a careful analysis of
the financial environment, since this area faces several risks. Even political
risks are part of the financial risks, among many other such commercial risks,
foreign exchange risks, inflation and so forth. In international business, the
two major concerns for the manager are how to get paid and how to avoid the
above mentioned risks. As money should flow between countries, credible
financial infrastructures like facilitating agencies, commercial banks,
research firms, are necessary. In some part of the world, the international
firm may have to be an integral partner in developing the various
infrastructures before it can operate, whereas in others, it may greatly
benefit from their high level of sophistication. </p>
<p Align=justify>In West Africa, every single country has its won national
commercial banks. However transactions towards neighboring countries are
sometimes restricted to some amount of money and take time to be done. There
are some commercial banks like Citibank, and Ecobank that faster service, since
they are established in several countries. Also, Western Union and Money Gram
are specialized money transfer agencies, which enable fluidity in
transactions.</p>

risks</strong></p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc13"></A>2.1. General context </h2>

<p Align=justify>Assessing the political environment is an important part in
any business decision. Laws and regulations passed by either local, regional
and central government bodies can affect foreign firms' operations. Also, firms
are comfortable assessing the political climates in their home countries.
However, assessing the political climates in other countries is still
problematic.</p>


<h4><A NAME="toc14"></A>   2.2. Classification and description of political
risks </h4>

<p Align=justify>When doing international business, the manager may face
several types of financial risks. The major types of financial risks are
commercial risks, political risks, exchange rate risks, and other such as
inflation-related risks. Thus, political risks are non commercial risks.
Political risks are any changes in the political environment that may adversely
affect the value of a firm's business activities. Political risks may occur in
any nation, but the risks vary considerably between countries. We may
distinguish two types of classification of political risks. A classification
based on the characteristic of political risks and a classification or
categorization based on the local government actions or control.  </p>
<p Align=left><strong>2.2.1 Classification based on the characteristics of
political risks </strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Characteristics refer to as the facts that are inherent to
each political risk. In other terms, their uniqueness or what make them
different from one another. There are three types of such characteristics:
ownership risks, operating risks, and transfer risks.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>                2.2.1.1. Ownership risk </strong></p>
<p Align=justify>                                In which the property of the
firm is threatened through expropriation,   </p>
<p Align=justify>                                confiscation or domestication.
Ownership risk exposes property and life. </p>
<p Align=left>                                The triad will be explained in
the second classification.</p>

the country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p Align=left><strong>2.2.2 Classification based host country
actions</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p Align=justify>We can distinguish two types: political risks out of the
government control and political risk induced by the government.</p>


<h4><A NAME="toc15"></A>                   2.2.2.1 Political risks out of
government control. </h4>

<p Align=justify>There are risks or events arise from nongovernmental actions,
factors that are outside the government responsibility. There are <strong>wars,
revolution, coup d'etat, terrorism, strikes, extortion, and
kidnappings</strong>. They all derived from some unstable social situation,
with population frustration and intolerance. All these risks can generate
violence, directed towards firms' property and employees. We may also have the
case of <strong>externally induced financial constraints and externally imposed
limits on imports or exports</strong>, especially in case of embargoes or any
economic sanctions against the host country.  </p>


<h4><A NAME="toc16"></A>                   2.2.2.2 Political risks induced by
the government</h4>

<p Align=justify>These risks constitute some laws directed against foreign
firms. Some government-induced risks are very drastic. There are expropriation,
confiscation and domestication. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong><u>Expropriation</u></strong> is the seizure of
foreign assets by a government with payment of compensation to the owners. In
other terms, it is involuntary transfer of property, with compensation, from a
privately owned firm to a host country government. Expropriation may generate
some funds for the owners. However, procedures to get paid from the government
are sometimes protracted and the final amount remains low. Furthermore, if no
compensation is paid, conflicts may erupt between the host country and the
country of the expropriated firm. For instance, the relations between U.S. and
Cuba acknowledge such situation, since Cuba does not offer compensation to U.S.
firms that have their assets sized.<sup>3<a name="fnref3"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn3">*</A>)</sup> Also, expropriation can refrain other companies from
investing in the concerned country.  </p>
<p Align=justify><strong><u>Confiscation</u> </strong>is another type of
ownership risk similar to expropriation, except compensation. It is involuntary
transfer of property, no compensation, from a privately owned firm to a host
country government. In confiscation, firms do not receive any funds from
government. Thereby, it represents a more risky situation for foreign firms.
Some industries are more vulnerable to confiscation than others because of
their importance to the host countries and their lack of ability to shift
operations. Sectors such as mining, energy, public utilities, and banking have
been targets of such government actions.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><u>Domestication</u> </strong>offers to governments a
subtle control over the foreign investments. There is a partial ownership
transfer and companies are urged to prioritize local production and to retain a
large share of the profit within the country. Domestication can negatively
impact the international marketer activities, as well as that of the entire
firm. For example, if foreign companies are forced to hire nationals as
managers, poor cooperation and communication can result. If domestication was
imposed within a short time span, poorly trained and inexperienced local
managers would head the firm operations with possible lost of profits. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong><u>Other government actions-related risks</u></strong>
are less dangerous but more common such as <strong>boycott, sabotage</strong>.
When facing shortage of foreign currency, government, sometimes, attempts to
<strong>control the movement of capital</strong> in and out of the country.
Often, <strong>exchange controls</strong> are levied selectively against
certain products or companies. Exchange controls limit importation of goods so
that firms might be confronted with difficulties in their regular transactions.
<strong>Severe restrictions on import</strong> can be a motive for foreign
corporate to shut down. Governments may also raise the tax rate applied to
foreign investors in order to control them and their capital. Government may
implement a <strong>price control system</strong>. Such control uses to derive
from a sensitive political situation. For example, social pressure may result
in a kind of price standardization for particular sectors like food,
transportation, fuel, and healthcare. </p>
<p Align=justify>Political risks like arms conflicts, insurrection may affect
all firms in the country equally. For that reason they are called <strong>macro
political risks</strong>. Unlike, nationalization, strikes, expropriation may
affect only a handful and specific firm, they are named <strong>micro political
risks</strong>. </p>

<p Align=left><strong>Chapter 1: Methodology for assessing political
risks</strong></p>


<h4><A NAME="toc17"></A>                1.1. Study area </h4>

<p Align=justify>The study area is Western Africa. It encompasses sixteen
countries. They are Benin, Burkina Faso, Capo Verde, Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory
Coast), Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger,
Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. All of them are member countries of
ECOWAS<sup>4<a name="fnref4"></a>(<A HREF="#fn4">*</A>)</sup> except
Mauritania. However, at the creation of the organization in 1975, Mauritania
was member. It left ECOWAS later to join the Arabic community of the northern
of Africa. ECOWAS covers all West African area, with a population of about 260
millions. ECOWAS encouraged free trade between member states but the
cooperation is still more political than economic. To mitigate conflicts of the
region, ECOWAS has established a West African force.  </p>
<p Align=justify>   </p>
<p Align=justify>Union Economique et Monetaire Ouest Africaine (UEMOA)<sup>5<a
name="fnref5"></a>(<A HREF="#fn5">*</A>)</sup> is the French speaking countries
economic integration group. It comprises of eight countries (Benin, Burkina
Faso, Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and
Togo. Unlike ECOWAS, UEMOA is a full economic integration organization. There
are no political activities. It constitutes a real free trade area.
Transactions have being facilitated because countries members share the same
currency, CFA ($ 1 = 500 CFA), and the same official language, French. They all
have the same colonial background because they have been colonized by France,
except Guinea Bissau that is a former Portuguese colony.  Other countries,
which own their currencies are Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Sierra Leone,
they form the West Africa Monetary zone (WAMZ), or simply called the second
monetary zone [4]. </p>


<h4><A NAME="toc18"></A>                1.2. Data sources, selection and
analysis.</h4>

<p Align=justify>To assess political risks and markets patterns in West Africa,
we rely on different data sources. Most data about political risks are
difficult to be obtained, since governments are reluctant to publish and make
official any political disturbances they may face. To this regards man relies
on the author throughout knowledge of the region. Some historical archives were
assessed though web site [4-6]. Also, we compiled data from the publications of
ECOWAS, and UEMOA that is an economic grouping of French speaking countries
libelled (Union Economique et Monetaire Ouest Africaine). We also, carried out
some online researches by visiting main internet directories such Yahoo.com,
Google.com. Key words like, &#171;<em>political risks, expropriation,
domestication, confiscation, west African wars, Africa import and export, Gross
domestic products Africa, &#187;</em>, have been used. In addition, we
interviewed some key workers of ECOWAS's economic branches. We assessed the
official websites of the heads of states of West African countries, and some
international political risks management -related organizations such as times
publications, global assessment risk<sup>6<a name="fnref6"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn6">*</A>)</sup> [7-12]. For additional economic information and
countries ranking indicators we refer to the journal, Le Monde [13]. Upon
compilation of data, analysis has been performed by Excel to calculate,
percentage, ratio, average, and sum, and make appropriate figures. </p>

<p Align=left>            HDI = Human development Index (United Nations, UNDP),
* year of occurrence of the risks, other are 2006-2007 data.  </p>
<p Align=justify>Any West African nation has experienced at least one &#171;out
of government control political risks&#187;.  A part from Senegal which has
been never confronted with coup d'etat, all other countries suffered from
coups. 5 in 15 countries (33%) have been at wars in their history. The most
recent civil wars in the region are that of Sierra Leone ended in 2002, and
Cote d'Ivoire started the same year, which is currently under post war
recovery. Liberia has drastically been destroyed by more ten years war
(1985-1995), followed by political instability. We know that civil wars per se,
are responsible of destruction of property, lost sales, disruption of
production, increased security costs, and lower productivity, to name a few.
Political upheavals are generally protracted. They may occur decades ago and
still have harmful impact on the socioeconomic situation and on foreign firms
willingness to invest.   </p>
<p Align=justify>It is true that the table did not take into account other
political risks such as ownership, and transfer risks. However, the results
point out the country's political riskiness based on the Euromoney's survey
[14]. This evaluation considered all types of political risks. Our analysis
demonstrated that 100% of West African countries are classified &#171;high
risk&#187;, and among them 80% are classified &#171;highest risk&#187;. There
are no countries with medium, low or lowest risks like the United States. In
that condition it is truly difficult to find an international marketer pushing
his firm to invest in West Africa, because it is a risky area. </p>
<p Align=justify>With the population data, we show that these 15 countries
represent a market of 260 millions potential customers. But all of them cannot
even assess to new products because of the lack of foreign investments due to
the fearful situation surrounding the market. Though some countries enjoy
economic growth (average = 5%) at U.S level, the GDP per capita remains low
(average = 503.75), and the Human Development Index (HDI, encompasses
education, life expectancy and income), is one of the lowest (average = 0.439)
far behind U.S.'s figures.  </p>
<p Align=justify>Speculation about population growth is a critical issue for
future international marketing. The number of people in a particular market
provides one of the most basic indicators of market size. In the coming year,
the world population will change with Africa having the highest growth rate
(above 3%), whereas U.S. and Western Europe will remains less than 1%. Of the
World 8.47 billions people, by 2025, more than 1.2 billions will be African
[15-16]. On market size basis, market opportunities will grow in Africa. Yet,
peace is needed. </p>

<h4><A NAME="toc20"></A>                2.2. Other specific political risks and
impacts</h4>

<p Align=left>                         2.2.1 Inflation rate and political
crisis</p>
<p Align=left>The following figure compares the inflation rate between UEMOA
(Union Monetaire West Africaine), and WAMZ (West Africa Monetary Zone). All
eight member states of UEMOA share the same currency, CFA, while each member of
WAMZ (Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone) has it own currency.</p>
<p Align=left>The finding is that the inflation rate of WAMZ is far above that
of UEMOA from 2001 to 2003. </p>
<p Align=left><img
src="Impact-of-political-risks-in-international-marketing-the-case-of-West-Africa1.png"
alt=""></p>
<p Align=justify>During this period, each group was facing tough political
situation. Sierra Leone and Cote d'Ivoire have been at wars. Though civil war
has been prevailing in each group, UEMOA kept a low inflation rate. We assume
that, this low rate is due to the relative stable currency, CFA. Regional
monetary grouping is a factor that favor better exchange rate in transactions.
European Union is another good example. Therefore, in international marketing
operations, a marketer should look for currency stability, and choose to work
with such monetary grouping countries, even though some political risks may
exist. West Africa nations, through ECOWAS are now planning to make one major
currency by putting UEMOA and WAMZ together. </p>


<h4><A NAME="toc21"></A>            2.2.2 Import and Export in UEMOA zone
during political conflicts</h4>

<p Align=justify>The following figure shows that from 2000 to 2003, EUMOA total
exports exceeded imports. During that period, Cote d'Ivoire the largest economy
of the group, 40% of total share, has been at civil war. Though in conflicting
situation, UEMOA did not face any trade deficit.  Production might be disrupted
but products can cross borders and be sold in neighboring countries. This
resulted in increase trade in other UEMOA countries and contributes to keep the
overall exports higher. An international marketer that really knows the terrain
where is making business, could always find opportunities when political risks
erupt. </p>

<blockquote>
<p Align=left>2.2.3 Employment distribution in UEMOA zone during political

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p Align=justify>We have selected employment status in UEMOA countries capital
cities, in 2001-2002. Figure 4 is an illustration. </p>
<p Align=justify>Private informal sector owns 76% of the employments, private
firms supply jobs up to 14%, public administration is responsible of 7% of jobs
rate against 2% for states-owned firms and 1% for other, mainly association
sector.</p>
<p Align=left><img
src="Impact-of-political-risks-in-international-marketing-the-case-of-West-Africa3.png"
alt=""></p>
<p Align=justify>Informal private sector is a specific work area in developing.
It comprises of individual not officially register as corporate, but who work
as such. Some work like, carpentry, shoes repairing fabric, hair cut
shops...etc, are concerned. As shown in the figure, it represents a huge
segment of market, which any international marketer should take into account if
his firm activities should encompass those sectors. Because he will have to
share customers with those individuals, plan should be carefully tailored.
People working in the informal private sector are easy to delocalize to work
for a national or multinationals, since their working conditions are too hard
and gains too small. </p>
<p Align=justify>The formal private sector covers only 14% of employment.  This
means that opportunities still exist, and one should foster private
investments, mainly in other non agricultural industries like communication,
mining, electricity, electronic, and so forth. Increasing investment is a way
to reduce the redundancy high rate (11.4%) in UEMOA Zone. </p>
<p Align=justify>States-owned firms represent only 2%, this is an indicator of
privatization that is going on in every country in Africa. </p>
<p Align=left> </p>


<h4><A NAME="toc22"></A>                2.3 Interactions between political
risks</h4>

<p Align=justify>There are some interactions between political risks man should
not ignore. A revolution or strikes are very often symptomatic of coup d'etat,
which in turn paves the way for wars. As shown in table 2, almost all countries
that have been into coup d'etat, face wars later on. In the same way, a
government conducting expropriation is neither far from confiscation nor
domestication. One risk entails this other. In some case, people can combine
many risks as means to operate. For instance, the methods used by terrorists
against business facilities include bombing, arson, hijacking, and sabotage. To
obtain funs, the terrorists resort to kidnappings, armed robbery, and
extortion<sup>7<a name="fnref7"></a>(<A HREF="#fn7">*</A>)</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>Obviously, impacts on economic indicators are also
interrelated. Even, environmental factors such cultural, economic, financial
and political and legal are also interconnected. Some cultural components of
the society may generate ethnocentrism, or lead directly to religious factions
and nationalism.  So, the problem is not to run away from political risks;
rather the international marketer should keep in mind such connections to
carefully investigate the causes of political risks. </p>
<p Align=justify>The international marketing manager should bear in mind that
Multinational Companies (MNCs) can either improve or hurt the economy of the
host country. MNCs may make direct investments in new plants and factories and
thereby creating jobs. Also, jobs can be provided for local constructors,
builders, and suppliers. Technology could be transfered to host country.  MNCs
may pay tax that benefic for national and local authorities like
municipalities. </p>
<p Align=justify>However, there is a subtle or opened competition between MNCs
and local firms, which may results in lost of profits and jobs for the latter.
MNCs can also increase the competition for workers or introduce products or
practices incompatible with the local culture. As local economy is becoming
dependant from MNCs, once an unfortunate event like shut down occurs, the
entire local economy is at high risk.  </p>
<p Align=justify>In area where corruption rate is high like West Africa, MNCs
can go for some illegal procedure of tax payment, as well as natural resources
exploitation. By corrupting government officers, MNCs will enrich some
individuals and the state itself will stay poor. </p>
<p Align=justify>Also, unfair incentives would allow foreign firms to keep
exploiting their employees with low income and no other suitable advantages.
Such practices can result in strike, extortion, sabotage and aggression of MNCs
property and employers. </p>


<h4><A NAME="toc23"></A>                2.4 Towards new type of political
risks. </h4>

<p Align=justify>In analyzing political risks occurrence factors, and as we
have mentioned in the classification, one focuses on risks out of government
control and political risks caused by the host country. This is true. However,
foreign firms also can create some political risks. Simply, how could we
understand the crucial lack of infrastructures in a Africa continent full of
natural resources, which move from there to other places? Any international
marketer, who would operate by developing the local environment, is going to
avoid additional political risks and therefore will succeed. Doing business in
Africa, require honesty and fairness and respect vis-&agrave;-vis the local
people. African people did not forget yet, the heavy burden of four centuries
of slavery and colonization, which are nothing but &#171;exploitation&#187;.
Thus, when international firms overlook the local people right and compromise
their survival, there is a kind of &#171;historical reflex&#187; that shows up
and pushes the entire population, and mainly the youth standing against the
threat. </p>
<p Align=justify>An international marketer willing to succeed in a long run
business in Africa should remember that historical context. Very often,
investors and other Western political leaders fail to realize that time has
passed and mind has being changing.  With globalization, increased level of
education, awareness raising programmes around the world, African people do
know what is able to help emerge from the current situation they are into.
Therefore, should they feel being neglected; they will fight back by erecting
criticism and violence. So, firms that neglect or put aside the host country
economic interests, are generating <strong>&#171;foreign firms- induced
political risks&#187;.</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Let consider the privatization we have mentioned above. As
former Soviet Union nations, African countries are shifting firm ownership from
public to private. Sometimes, governments are under financial pressure and have
to do so to save some key corporate like oil, water supply, electricity and
post industries. In Africa, there is a second type of political risk we may
call <strong>&#171;exterior pressure-induced firms&#187;.</strong>  In fact,
some governments are reluctant to sell states-owned firms. However, given the
worse economic condition, and the burden of exterior and even interior
indebtedness, Western governments (mainly former colonizers), make pressure to
acquire some states-owned firms operating in promising sectors like energy,
water, and agriculture. We may call it privatization, but actually it is not
real privatization. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Chapter 3:   Recommendations</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Before making recommendations, it is important to review some
limitations of this study. The main limitation is the shortage of data about
political risks. Though, we have focused on some political risks, others were
not properly coped with. For instance, it would have been much better to
analyze in deep the extent of expropriation, confiscation, domestication, and
nationalization. What are governments that perform such political risks? What
are their purposes? How many firms have been under such risks and what are they
countries of origin? Also, the scarcity of organs of trade regulations in
Africa, did not allow us to make some case study so elucidate how do firms use
to address political risks, and whether is the system similar in the 15
countries of ECOWAS? However, the above limitations did not hamper our
objectives. Subsequently, based on the findings, the following recommendations
have been made. </p>
<p Align=justify>i. Any African country should have a corporate of experts in
international marketing, to form association like American Marketing
Association (AMA). This network of African experts will work in partnership
with association of other developed and developing countries. Such groups of
professionals will raise the importance of international marketing to domestic
firms, trade related-decision makers, government bodies or organization like
ECOWAS, WAMZ, and UEMOA...etc. Furthermore, the association could advocate and
do some social mobilization about political risks in the context of Africa.
Such home-based marketing experts could help foreign investors understand the
African context, by leading them to generate local wealth and support local
economy. </p>
<p Align=justify>ii. To protect themselves from changes in international
environment, firm should continually monitor the political situations in the
countries in which they operate by consulting with local staff, embassy
officials, and, where appropriate, firms specializing in political risks
management. The monitoring system should be built up on some political risks
indicators and determinants. Each international marketing department of any
firms should elaborate it own criteria of political stability propitious to
foreign investments. For instance, gathering indicators and their determinants
can be done by providing clear and precise answers to the following questions
proposed by some authors<sup>8<a name="fnref8"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn8">*</A>)</sup>. Firms can score this set of questions and obtain a
score that could serve as guideline. </p>
<p Align=justify>1. Is the country a democracy or dictatorship? </p>
<p Align=justify>2. Is power concentrated in the hands of one person or one
political party?  </p>
<p Align=justify>3. Does the country normally rely on the free market or on
government controls to allocate resources?</p>
<p Align=justify>4. How much of a contribution is the private sector expected
to make in helping the government achieve its overall economic objectives?</p>
<p Align=justify>5. Does the government view foreign firms as a means of
promoting or hindering its economic goals?</p>
<p Align=justify>6. Are the firm's customers in the public or private
sector?</p>
<p Align=justify>7. If firm's customers are in public, does the government
favor domestic suppliers?</p>
<p Align=justify>8. Are the firm's competitors are in the public or private
sector?</p>
<p Align=justify>9. If competitors are in public sector, will the government
allow foreigners to compete with the public firms on even terms?</p>
<p Align=justify>10. When making changes in its policies, does the government
act arbitrarily, does it rely on the rules of law?</p>
<p Align=justify>11. How stable is the existing government?</p>
<p Align=justify>12. If the government leaves office, will there be drastic
changes in the economic policies of the new government?</p>
<p Align=justify>iii. Before starting any activities, at the implementation
face, the foreign firms should have an international business contracts with
the host country, which clearly define the right and obligations of each side.
The contracts between West African countries and foreign firms should provide
answers to each political risk. Resolution should not only focus on the effects
of the risks, but deal with the deep causes of the risks. Since we believe that
any political risk has it root somewhere, investigations should lead to the
causes. Then, foreign firms and host government responsibilities should be
clearly established in an outstanding fair process. To make the process
corruption free or intimidation free, it is better in delicate conflicts to
adopt arbitration<sup>9<a name="fnref9"></a>(<A HREF="#fn9">*</A>)</sup>.
Because of the speed, privacy, and informality of such proceedings, disputes
can often be resolved cheaply than through the court system. It is time to urge
African governments and decision-makers to create association like the American
Arbitration Association to softly mitigate trade conflicts through arbitration.
It is known that 16 francophone African nations have established a regional
commercial arbitration court in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. [17]. Duplication of
such initiative is welcomed in Africa, because it builds trust and confidence,
and increases foreign investments. </p>
<p Align=justify>iv. Another alternative for African nations is to follow the
United States example. U.S. uses to negotiate bilateral treaties to protect its
firm from arbitrary actions by host country governments. This is a government-
to- government negotiation. These treaties require the host country to agree to
arbitrate investment disputes involving host country and citizens of other
country. Inversely, the treaties can ask the country of the foreign firms to
keep host country rules and be responsible for any damages they may cause to
the host country.  </p>
<p Align=justify>v. In all cases, cautious contracts should find room for the
following issues: Which country's law applies, the host country or the foreign
firm home country, and in which country should the issue be resolved? Which
technique should be use to resolve the conflicts that may occur, litigation,
arbitration, mediation or negotiation? And how will the settlement be enforced?
Individual country courts should be involved in the contract process, so that
in case of disputes they can react accordingly. </p>
<p Align=justify>vi. International communities like the WTO, must appropriately
react if one side did not observe the terms of the contracts. There is need for
the WTO to fairly start guiding and protecting the world business partners with
possibility to sue the guilty party in courts. This would bring in relief in
Africa. </p>
<p Align=justify>vii. The United States created the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation (OPIC) that insures US overseas investments against
nationalization, insurrections or revolutions, and foreign-exchange
inconvertibility. Such institutions can be adapted to serve and protect African
countries' interest.  </p>
<p Align=justify>viii. Also, the World Bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency (MIGA), which provides insurance against political risks, should be
known from African countries. And if not done yet, MIGA must include some
actions in it guidelines that can protect African host countries. </p>


<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc24"></A>CONCLUSION</h1>

<p Align=justify>Some degree of political risk exists in every country,
although the nature and importance of these risks vary. In political risks
assessment, as in most business decisions, it is a matter of balancing risks
rewards. </p>
<p Align=justify>If a firm is considering an investment in a political risky
environment, it should be sure that it can obtain rates of return that are high
enough to offset the risks of entering that market. </p>
<p Align=justify>A firm might build a domestic political support in the host
country by being a good corporate citizen; for example, the firm might purchase
inputs from local suppliers where possible, employ African countries citizen in
key management and administrative positions, and support local charities.</p>
<p Align=justify>West African is confronted with many political upheavals, but
the market potential is still high. International marketing is a one of the
pillar of world peace, as international relations are. So invest in a risky
country could yield peace that will increase profits.  What and how much
information a firm needs to assess political risk will depend on the type of
