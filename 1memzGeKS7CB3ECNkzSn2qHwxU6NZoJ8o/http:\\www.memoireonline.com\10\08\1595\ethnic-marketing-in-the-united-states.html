<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc1"></A>Introduction</h1>

<p Align=justify>B</p>
<p Align=justify>ack in time, appealing to people from minority groups was not
a major interest to marketers in most companies. In the United States, the
ethnic populations were expected to fit in with the white population. But time
has proven this reasoning false. As a result of many economic and social
factors, people are beginning to discover that America is no longer the melting
pot it once was. Instead of looking to assimilate, certain ethnic groups such
as Afro-Americans, Asians and Hispanics have fought to maintain their own
cultural integrity. From that moment has started the ethnic marketing
phenomenon which consisted in segmenting the market by creating products
adapted to each ethnic group and by respecting these differences. This trend
which started in the United States is now seducing more and more countries but
it has more impact in the United States because the most recent census made it
clear that the United States are fast becoming more ethnically diverse. We can
observe an exception in France because despite the important number of
immigrants, the French companies don't adopt the ethnic marketing because of
republican principles. Ethnic Marketing in the United States is no longer a
trend but a necessity if companies want to succeed because by 2050, the ethnic
minorities will represent half the population of the United States. Ethnic
Americans are increasing in size seven times as fast as northern Americans and
are on their way to becoming the majority. Marketers want to have a good
conscious thanks to a good integration policy but above all they are worried
about &#171;business&#187; as the 21<sup>st</sup> century is experiencing
profound demographic changes. As a consequence, many companies have been caught
unaware by the resulting major shifts taking place in the American market place
today. In today's marketplace, does selling effectively to this new America is
a key to the long-term survival and success of any company?</p>
<p Align=justify>In a first part, I will explain what ethnic marketing is by
giving its definition, its origin with the beautician CJ Walker, the
Immigration Reform Bill and Pepsi Cola, by explaining the notion of melting pot
and salad bowl. In a second part, I will talk about the economic weight of the
ethnic people and present the new America with their pay raise, the increase in
their buying power, their values and buying behavior. In a third part, I will
give the different ethnic marketing strategies, the case of some companies that
follow the ethnic marketing and give their limits as well. In a fourth part, I
will show how the ethnic people are represented in the Medias and finally I
will draw a small comparison with France because as the United States, France
has an important rate of immigrants, however the French companies don't find an
interest in wooing the ethnic people and prefer to borrow the American word
melting pot to describe the French society.</p>
<p Align=justify>Once upon a time in a country where reigned only one god: the
dollar...</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>I- THE MEANING OF ETHNIC MARKETING</strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>A- Definition of Ethnic Marketing</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>First of all, what does an ethnic group means? &#171;An ethnic
group (also called a people or an ethnicity) is a 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_%28sociology%29" rel="nofollow">group</A> of 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human" rel="nofollow">human beings</A> whose members
identify with each other, usually on the basis of a presumed common 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy" rel="nofollow">genealogy</A> or 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestry" rel="nofollow">ancestry</A>. Ethnic identity
is also marked by the recognition from others of a group's distinctiveness and
by common 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture" rel="nofollow">cultural</A>, 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic" rel="nofollow">linguistic</A>, 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion" rel="nofollow">religious</A>, 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_behaviour" rel="nofollow">behavioral</A> or 
<A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_%28classification_of_human_beings%29" rel="nofollow">biological</A>
traits.&#187;1<a name="fnref1"></a>(<A HREF="#fn1">*</A>)</p>
<p Align=justify>Then, let's explain what marketing is. &#171;Marketing is an
ongoing process of planning and executing of the marketing mix (Product, Price,
Place, and Promotion) of products, services or ideas to create exchange between
individuals and organizations. Marketing tends to be seen as a creative
industry, which includes 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising" rel="nofollow">advertising</A>, 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution" rel="nofollow">distribution</A> and 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales" rel="nofollow">selling</A>. It is also concerned
with anticipating the customers' future needs and wants, which are often
discovered through market research. Essentially, marketing is the process of
creating or directing an organization to be successful in selling a product or
service that people not only desire, but are willing to buy.&#187;2<a
name="fnref2"></a>(<A HREF="#fn2">*</A>)</p>
<p Align=justify>So, the ethnic marketing considers that nowadays there exists
a market parallel to the mass market: a market for the communities. It consists
in accepting a society made of different communities which distinguish
themselves by their life style, their language, their way of dressing, their
leisure etc. The ethnic marketing accepts that each ethnic group has a
different way of consuming and capitalizes on that by launching products and
advertising campaigns supposed to reflect their desires and needs. </p>
<p Align=justify>The ethnic marketing is also called multicultural marketing.
Putting a Black, an Asian, and a Hispanic in advertising in order to reflect
the demographic reality of a country doesn't mean ethnic marketing like
Benetton who considers that we are all the same despite our different skin
color. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>B- The origin of ethnic marketing in the United
States</strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>? <u>CJ Walker</u></strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Ethnic Marketing was born in the United States in 1900 with CJ
Walker, a black beautician. She noticed at that time that black women wanted to
integrate in the American society, mainly white, and resorted to all sorts of
amazing methods in order to straighten their hair as using a flatiron and it
resulted in many deceptions (accidents, burns, hair loss...). She had the idea
to launch a heating brush which was able to straighten frizzy hair without any
danger. Without any marketing plan, she succeeded in inventing a revolutionary
product among black women. But can we talk about ethnic marketing as women
wanted to assimilate into the white community instead of keeping their
difference apart? Her face appeared on the packing of the products to prove
that she was herself black. The product was not only cheap in order to be
available for the poor majority but it was enough high to prove its good
quality as well. Mrs. Walker provided the product to the beauty institutes and
thanks to door-to-door selling as well. She seduced the black celebrities like
Josephine Baker 3<a name="fnref3"></a>(<A HREF="#fn3">*</A>) and when CJ Walker
met with success, she supported many associations and organizations for black
people. At her death in 1919, she let a fortune of 1 million dollars, a
significant amount at that time. She was the first self-educated millionaire
woman in the United States.</p>
<p Align=justify>? <strong><u>The Immigration Reform Bill</u></strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Besides, according to the historian Marilyn Halter, the
Immigration Reform Bill of 1965 is at the origin of this new America and of
course at the origin of ethnic marketing, under the President Lyndon Johnson.
This bill put an end to the precedence given to white immigrants contrary to
minorities who were prone to restrictive quotas with an annual limitation of
170 000 visas. This bill had been put into effect by the President Calvin
Coolidge in 1924 who wished that America would remain white and was heavily
supported by Senator Ted Kennedy. In 1900, 90 % of the newly arrived immigrants
were white Europeans, whereas in the eighties they were only11%.</p>
<p Align=justify>? <strong><u>Pepsi Cola</u></strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The pioneer in ethnic marketing is Pepsi Cola. Indeed Pepsi
Cola was the only brand to water the Afro Americans during the Second World War
at a time where the army was still segregated. In 1946, the brand claims its
strong intentions to conquer the black community market and hires black people.
A few years later, black people are part of Pepsi's advertising campaigns and
the brand sponsors black universities and TV programs and confronts the boycott
launched by the Klu Klux Klan.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>C- From  the &#171;&nbsp;melting pot&nbsp;&#187; to
the &#171;&nbsp;salad bowl&nbsp;&#187; concept</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The first generations of immigrants in the United States were
part of the famous social phenomenon called the <em>melting pot</em>. This term
was used for the first time in 1964 by Gordon, a researcher in sociology.
<em>Melting pot</em> means ingredients mixed, smashed and cooked together, a
sort of meal made of different foods which like a puree change into a whole
with a uniform taste.</p>
<p Align=justify>Up to a recent period, all the newly arrived on the American
territory used to fit in with the white population in order to accede to the
American dream as soon as possible. One should not forget that the new
immigrants fled from poverty, war, exclusion...so their wish was to adopt the
American way of life to forget their dramatic situation and become a
full-fledged American citizen. The immigrants did their best during decades to
be accepted in the white society. That's why they didn't want to differ in
their culture, education or food. The ethnic marketing was used only in order
to help them to integrate better into the standards of the main population.
That was the case of CJ Walker. But this trend has changed with the fast
increasing of the non white population. Thus, ethnic groups were unable to
preserve their cultures.</p>
<p Align=justify>Then, a new concept emerged called the <em>salad bowl</em>. In
this salad bowl different ingredients are going to get mixed (such as pepper,
tomato, lettuce, corn...) but each is going to keep its taste and color. This
means that the new immigrants want no longer to assimilate but to keep their
origin language and values. Everybody brings its contribution to the culture.
Nowadays the immigrants don't have to get rid of their mother tongue or culture
to find a job, watch television or succeed in school... these different
cultures don't merge together into a single homogeneous culture. We can talk of
a cultural mosaic.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>II- THE ECONOMIC WEIGHT OF THE ETHNIC
MARKET</strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>A- Who is the new America?</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Statistics show that from 2050, the minorities will represent
half the population of the USA so it sounds inappropriate to use the word
<em>minority.4<a name="fnref4"></a>(<A HREF="#fn4">*</A>)</em></p>
<p Align=justify>Today, the Afro Americans represent 36.2 million people out of
a total of 300 million people in the United States.5<a name="fnref5"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn5">*</A>)</p>
<p Align=justify>The Hispanics are &#171;&nbsp;the ethnic minority&nbsp;&#187;
the most represented in the United States. They are 37 millions so it is
essential for marketers not to neglect this community 6<a name="fnref6"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn6">*</A>). Today, 20.6 millions of Mexicans, 3.4 millions of Porto
Ricans and 1.2 millions of Cubans are part of this community. By 2010, one
person out of six will be Hispanic in America. According to demographic
expectations, the Hispanic community will represent 53 million people by 2020.
One Californian out of three is Hispanic. There annual growth rate is seven
times as high as that of the rest of the population. This population is the
most important economic potential. </p>
<p Align=justify>The Asians constitute 4% of the American population. Indeed
they are about 10 millions but their number should double by 2020. It is very
difficult to reach the Asian market because of the different languages and
because of their cultural differences.  There are six main groups: Chinese (2.4
million), Filipino (1.8 million), Indians (1.6 million), Vietnamese (1.1
million), Korean (1.07 million), Japanese (796&nbsp;000). </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>B- The pay raise for ethnic people</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>According to Alfred Shreiber 7<a name="fnref7"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn7">*</A>), Asians, Hispanics and Afro Americans &#171;are accessing
the means to prosperity&#187;. A survey found that these consumers are
increasing their household incomes, obtaining mortgages, owning small business
and earning higher education degrees. They are no longer the poor they used to
be but middle-class citizens.</p>
<p Align=justify>The Afro American's income is more important than that of the
other groups: 485 billion dollars in 2000. It has doubled since 1998 and should
reach 705 billion dollars in 2005. The Afro Americans spend almost all their
income and don't save money.</p>
<p Align=justify>The Hispanics average income enhanced by 20% between 1991 and
2001, whereas the global average income increased by only 6%.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>C- The increase in the ethnic community buying
power</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>According to Alfred Schreiber<em>, </em>the buying power of
ethnic groups has doubled during this decade.8<a name="fnref8"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn8">*</A>)</p>
<p Align=justify>The Asians buying power has increased by 124 %, from 110
billion dollars to 255 billion dollars in 2001. </p>
<p Align=justify>The Afro Americans buying power has increased by 85 %. It went
from 307.8 billion dollars to 572.1 billion in only ten years.</p>
<p Align=justify>The Hispanic buying power has increased by 118%. Their buying
power should increase from 686 billion dollars in 2004 to 992 billion dollars
in 2009.</p>
<p Align=left><img src="ethnic-marketing-in-the-united-states1.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=justify>Asians  and Hispanics spending power is growing between 8% and
10% annually, much faster than the general population. But their use of
financial services products still lags behind the general population. The
Native Americans buying power has hardly increased since 2000 whereas the
Hispanics buying power has boomed since 20002.  From 2000 to 2004, the African
Americans had the biggest buying power but they have been beaten by the
Hispanics.</p>
<p Align=justify>All the minorities saw their buying power increase in 2002
with a slow take-off between 2000 and 2002 probably because of the stock
exchange crash due to the internet crisis between 2000 and 2002.</p>
<p Align=justify> </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>D- The ethnic people values and purchasing
behavior</strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>? <u>The Blacks</u></strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The black population purchasing power is booming. This huge
increase gives a glimpse to the economic potential that represents the Afro
Americans.</p>
<p Align=justify>The black community helps marketers to buy music, clothes and
sport items thanks to their position of trend makers. Some brands like Nike
have the chance to find through Afro Americans &#171;human hoardings&#187;. The
popularity of street marketing is linked to the fact that marketers noticed
that the trends appear in the downtown area with a high concentration of black
people. The best way to do is to conduct the young white community to buy and
to make sure that the black people buy these items foremost. However, figures
show that the biggest consumers of hip hop are white people-for example
two-thirds of hip-hop records are bought by white people. Big brands like Nike,
Tommy Hilfiger woo the Black community counting on the success of the Hip Hop
movement. Tommy Hilfiger was at the beginning destined to the white
&#171;BCBG&#187;. A rumor on the net according to which Tommy Hilfiger declared
on Oprah Winfrey's talk show that if he had known that his clothes would have
so much success among the Black, he wouldn't have made them so beautiful,
offended the black community. The company rejected of course this rumor.</p>
<p Align=justify>Anne Seng&egrave;s defines Afro Americans in her book
<em>Ethink!9<a name="fnref9"></a>(<A HREF="#fn9">*</A>)</em> as &#171;trend
designers&#187;.  Marketers noticed that Blacks want no longer to look like
whites whereas Whites want to look like Blacks.</p>
<p Align=justify>Afro Americans spend 98% of their income. In order to
understand what separates Afro Americans from other ethnic groups, we have to
go back in the past. Indeed, contrary to Asians or Hispanics who came to
America at their own free will, Blacks have been forced. Thus, according to Ken
Smikle who wrote <em>Target Market News</em>, Afro Americans tend to spend more
in luxury goods in order to show that they are as important as the others among
the Americans and that they have power as well.</p>
<p Align=justify>The Black community is very attracted by hair products, make
up, body cares, jewels, women accessories and electronic equipments. They are
ready to spend more to have the best products available on the market. However,
they spend less in insurance, in fitment or home appliances.</p>
<p Align=justify>The Afro Americans consumed for 491 billion dollars of
products and services in 1999 which explains why the companies target more and
more this community because they are conscious that they are a real source of
return.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>? <u>The Hispanics </u></strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Hispano-Americans tend more and more to integrate Latino
cultures in the American culture rather than leaving their original culture and
traditions because being Latino is trendy. This feeling rose among the young
people thanks to Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin or Shakira who are not only seen
as ambassadors of the Latino culture among Hispanics but among white Americans
as well because they are famous. Latinos care about religion, family and care
about their look as well-thus many companies like Procter &amp; Gamble, Johnson
&amp; Johnson, household appliances company and cosmetics company charmed more
this community fond of cosmetics.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>? <u>The Asians </u></strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The image that marketers have about them is that they are
richer than the other communities, with strong family values. They accord a
great importance to Asian traditions which impose the respect of the eldest.
For example the buying decisions are made with all the family and are carefully
thought-out. Higher education is really important for this community because it
as a social and professional passport. They carry out everything like denying
themselves from material goods in order to offer their children a high level of
education in order to insure a good wage in the future.. Asians are perceived
as good investors. They are more likely to save money rather than spend it. As
a consequence there are good targets for banks. This group is the favorite one
for banks, insurance companies or telecommunication companies. Even car
builders are seduced by them and try to change their habits for Asian cars
because Asians prefer upscale cars and 70 % buy new cars rather than secondhand
cars. No matter how difficult it is to reach them because of all the difference
nationalities, they live in the same towns like Honolulu or San Francisco that
counts more Asians than Whites. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>III- THE ETHNIC MARKETING STRATEGIES</strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>A- The strategy of integration</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>This method doesn't consist in changing the marketing strategy
by creating products adapted to each ethnic group. Its strategy is to include
people with different skin color (Africans, Asians, and Hispanics) beside white
people in advertising. The best example is illustrated with United Colors of
Benetton. The goal is to create a product adapted to everyone no matter what
your skin color is.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>B- The micro-marketing strategy</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The popularized strategy micro-marketing has been named by
Procter &amp; Gamble 10<a name="fnref10"></a>(<A HREF="#fn10">*</A>). It
consists in changing subtly certain elements of the marketing-mix 11<a
name="fnref11"></a>(<A HREF="#fn11">*</A>) for a given range of products or
services that the company decides to present in a more attractive way to a
specific ethnic group: different types of point of sale promotion, adaptation
of the advertisings according to the language of each ethnic group we want to
reach, a specific choice for the distribution network and the use of the ethnic
medias beside the mass market medias. Beyond Procter &amp; Gamble, many
companies resort to this strategy like many cosmetic groups as Avon or Mary
Kay.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>C- The multicultural  marketing strategy</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>A multicultural marketing strategy has become the ultimate
solution adopted by the biggest American corporations. Since the beginning of
the nineties, many specialists in ethnic marketing have emerged. There are
today almost 250 agencies specialized in ethnic marketing, in the United
States. The advertisers resort to them in order to implant a strong
multicultural know-how within the companies. In many marketing departments, we
find a division that makes sure that the general marketing strategy
incorporates well the different ethnic segments. At Procter &amp; Gamble, there
is a vice president for ethnic markets. The first agency targeting Hispanics
was created in 1962 by Luis Albertini.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>D- The grassroot marketing strategy</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The grassroot marketing consists in using cultural events,
like the Chinese New Year, to put a product on the market and many companies
resort to this strategy to attract consumers.</p>
<p Align=justify>El Cinco de Mayo celebrates the victory of Mexico over France
in 1862 and became a huge celebration in the United States among the Latinos.
What is funny is that it is more celebrated in the United States than in
Mexico. The companies don't miss this kind of opportunity to spread their
brand. Another example, the US Portal edited in 1998 commemorative stamps.
Besides, the Coca Cola brand got associated with a biscuit brand and proposed
to consumers to organize its own commemoration of the fifth of May. Moreover,
Kwanzaa is a week-long festival celebrated primarily in the 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" rel="nofollow">United States</A>,
honoring 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American" rel="nofollow">African-American</A>
heritage from 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_26" rel="nofollow">December 26</A><sup>th</sup>
to 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1" rel="nofollow">January 1</A><sup>st</sup>. It
was created on the 26<sup>th</sup> of December of 1967. Its aim was to
&#171;give a Black alternative to the existing holiday and give Blacks an
opportunity to celebrate themselves and history, rather than simply imitate the
practice of the dominant society.&#187;12<a name="fnref12"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn12">*</A>) This festivity was supposed to be a non-profit alternative
to the commercial outburst of Christmas. Of course many companies took
advantage of this celebration to make profit with the black community.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>E- The ethnic marketing producers </strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>? <u>The case of Pepsi Cola and Coca
Cola</u></strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The beginning of the competition between the Pepsi-Cola and
Coca-Cola companies in the 1940s is a legend in business.13<a
name="fnref13"></a>(<A HREF="#fn13">*</A>) But what people ignore is that their
biggest battle was the struggle of Afro-Americans to gain access to white
Corporate America. Underdog Pepsi-Cola, under the leadership of a smart
businessman, joined forces with a group of striving African-American
professionals. Their union made history, and taught American businesses a
lesson.</p>
<p Align=justify>Pepsi has been the first to be interested in the communities.
The story says that the first person who took a swig of the famous Pepsi was a
Black. Caleb Bradham invented Pepsi Cola in 1898 and assigned to his assistant,
a young Afro-American called James Henry King, the task to taste the drink that
he had just concocted.</p>
<p Align=justify>The Pepsi-Cola experiment began in 1940 when the company hired
the first black man, Herman T. Smith, a 28-year-old newspaper adman &#171;to
launch a campaign to pump up sales of Pepsi in black communities,&#187;14<a
name="fnref14"></a>(<A HREF="#fn14">*</A>)/15<a name="fnref15"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn15">*</A>) and was followed by the addition of two young business
interns, Allen L. McKellar and Jeanette Maund during the pre civil rights era.
Their task was to be the first black Americans to work at professional jobs in
Corporate America and to target black consumers as a distinct market.</p>
<p Align=justify>During the Second World War, Pepsi was the unique soda to
water the Afro-American regiments at a time when the American army was still
segregated. From 1946, the company, hired a team if 10 Afro-Americans, leaded
by Edward Boyd, in order to promote the product among &#171;their
brothers&#187;. It is the beginning of the ethnic marketing. Three years later,
Pepsi made its first advertising campaign for the Black Community featuring Ron
Brown, seven years old, who will be under President Bill Clinton the trading
state secretary. In the fifties, the company sent scholarships to the United
Negro College Fund. A few years later, despite the threats of the Klu Klux
Klan, Pepsi appointed a Black at the vice presidency. It sponsors many TV
programs which pay tribute to the black culture and sponsors as well Lionel
Richie, Tina Turner on their tour in the eighties. Michael Jackson becomes
Pepsi's spokesman. At the same time, appeared the first advertising on
television in Spanish on a big channel. &#171;Joy of Pepsi&#187; becomes
&#171;Goza el Sabor&#187; in order to seduce the baby boomers who weren't born
on the American territory and who conserved their traditions. Now we can find
Shakira, Ricky Martin, Beyonce, Britney Spears in Pepsi campaigns... however
Pepsi Cola prefers to feature celebrities from ethnic groups.</p>
<p Align=justify>The war of colas is in its full swing on the ethnic markets.
Coca and Pepsi target the same public with as much aggressiveness. In order to
seduce the young people, the soda giants organize many events in the
communities by distributing free t-shirts and cans. For example, conscious of
the Latinos' love for football, Coca had organized a small World Cup in some
schools in Texas because there is a high Hispanic population, giving drinks to
the participants. The Fanta soda (Coca Cola's property) appeared in the United
States after an absence of twenty years only because the Latinos love this
drink in Latin America. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>? <u>The case of Mattel</u></strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The case of Mattel with its famous &#171;Barbie&#187; created
in 1959, is particularly interesting. From the beginning of the eighties, Black
Barbies, Asians or Latinos were already on the market but it was still at the
basis the White Barbie which body had been colored. The advertising campaigns
accorded no place at that time for minority dolls. Mattel introduced Christie,
the first ethnic doll created in 1968 which was African and which had been
followed by Theresa, the Latino in 1988 and Kira, the Asian in 1990 16<a
name="fnref16"></a>(<A HREF="#fn16">*</A>). It is only since the beginning of
the nineties that a real strategy has been put in place and that the dolls
adopted the body type of the different ethnic groups, put on the market and
supported by advertising campaigns appearing in ethnic magazines or TV
programs. It is called &#171;go ethnic&#187; by Mattel. The results have been
amazing. In only one year, the sale of Black Barbies (Asha, Nichelle, Jamal...)
has been doubled. A multiethnic Barbie was created in 2002 as well and reflects
the racial mixture, called Kayla 17<a name="fnref17"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn17">*</A>). She has slightly a darker skin than Caucasian Barbie and
vaguely Asian facial features, but she still has the same body measurements and
can wear the same clothes as her blonde counterpart. A Shakira Barbie doll has
been recently created at the effigy of the Colombian singer. </p>
<p Align=justify>In 2000, Mattel decided to launch the first Barbie running for
President, &#171;Barbie for president 2000&#187;, three candidates were
represented in order to reflect the multicultural nature of the country: a
caucasian Barbie, an African American Barbie and a Hispanic Barbie. &#171;This
snub from Mattel Inc., the nation's largest toymaker, has angered many Asian
Americans, who already feel overlooked in many spheres of U.S. life despite
being the nation's third largest minority.&#187;18<a name="fnref18"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn18">*</A>) Concerned with the politically correct, the next year,
Mattel launched Lea, an Asian doll, prettier than Kira, the first Asian
doll.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>? <u>The case of L'Oreal with
Softsheen-Carson</u></strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The French world leader in cosmetics, L'Oreal, is among the
best experts in ethnic marketing. Indeed, the company purchased Softsheen
Products Inc. in 1998, leader in ethnic hair products, and two years later,
Carson Inc., world leader in ethnic cosmetics. SoftSheen-Carson realized 200
million dollars turnover in 2003. Today, the company's market share in the
United States is 28 %. The success was so high that the cosmetic world leader
put in place a research center in Chicago in order to develop its offer by
studying more the black hair and skin. Today, SoftSheen-Carson represents 12%
of the world market for hair products made for black women. Softsheen-Carson
devotes time and money to familiarize the consumers with the products by using
the sampling technique which consists in distributing free samples. Based on
its success, L'Oreal recently took over Mizani, a company specialized in
professional hair products for Black women as well.</p>
<p Align=justify>L'Oreal noticed that black women spend three times more than
Caucasian women. They use nine times more hair products, seven times more
makeup and five times more cares than white women in the same conditions. There
exist in the USA about 6500 beauty shops for ethnic products and black women
are less faithful to a brand than Latinas because of the huge choice of
products.</p>
<p Align=justify>The huge advertising campaigns where appear one Asian woman,
one Caucasian woman and one Black woman shows L'Oreal high interest for ethnic
communities because L'Oreal adapts to the nature of each woman. The two Latino
actresses, Penelope Cruz and Eva Longoria are the ambassadors of L'Oreal's
campaign.</p>
<p Align=justify>According to estimations, ethnic women spend 1.6 billion
dollars on beauty products in big stores and 3.5 billion dollars in beauty
shops. The president of Softsheen-Carson said that 80 % of the world
populations present a certain degree of ethnicity through the multiple
crossbreeding. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>? <u>The case of Nestl&eacute;</u></strong></p>


<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc2"></A>The enforcement of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, NAFTA, in the nineties, made it easier to import Latino items. The
big alimentation giant, Nestl&eacute;, became conscious of the potential of the
Latinos and understood that the best way was to import items already
appreciated in America Latina in cities with a big Latino population like New
York or Miami. Nestl&eacute; is 27th among a list of the 60 biggest advertisers
on the Latino market. Aware of their love for coffee with cream, sugar and
cacao or cinnamon, Nestl&eacute; created Nescafe Frothe to seduce the Latino
market. According to an article, Nestl&eacute; launches Nescafe Frothe in US
19<a name="fnref19"></a>(<A HREF="#fn19">*</A>), Nescafe Frothe was first
launched in 2001 in Los Angeles, a test market. </h1>


<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc3"></A>Nescafe understood as well that in order to have
success, the brand should implant among the community thanks to the grassroot
marketing. For example, during a charity celebration-Church has an important
place among the Latinos and Nestl&eacute; distributed many samples of Nescafe
Frothe.</h1>


<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc4"></A>?The case of Sears</h1>


<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc5"></A>Sears, the 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" rel="nofollow">American</A> mid-range
chain of 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International" rel="nofollow">international</A> 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_store" rel="nofollow">department stores</A>
and the largest retailer in the United States is also responding to the demand
in Asian communities for a larger selection of smaller sizes for all apparel
categories.&nbsp; Moreover, Sears launched a pantyhose line with a variety of
shades and sheer textures to complement a black woman's skin color and
accommodate her figure.&nbsp;Black women tend to have fuller hips and slimmer
ankles than the mass market. </h1>

<p Align=justify><strong>F- The limits of ethnic marketing</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Ethnic marketing is a delicate art. No matter how important
the minorities love to be cuddled, they are not dupe and don't hesitate to
boycott a brand if they judge it impious. So companies have to deal with them
carefully. Moreover, some companies are afraid to resort to ethnic marketing in
order not to be accused of racism in case of heavy-handedness. Humor has to be
handled with caution.</p>
<p Align=justify>The thing to avoid in the world of ethnic advertising is of
course the literal translation. Certain companies learned it at their expense.
Bill Imada, expert in the Asian market, gave the example of a company that
wanted to translate &#171;do you have a minute?&#187; in Korean. In Korea, this
expression is used to solicit a woman in a bar.</p>
<p Align=justify>The other trap is the use of stereotypes. In the eighties,
Chevrolet, the American car brand, broadcasted a TV advertising directing a
black woman using her posterior to shine her car-a joke that the black
community didn't appreciate.</p>
<p Align=justify>Moreover, the cultural sensitiveness has to be considered as
well. General Mills, a company mainly concerned with food, intended to woo the
Hispanics in the beginning of the nineties with the Bunuelitos breakfast
cereals. The campaign directing a grandmother burying the cereals in her garden
in order to put them out of her grandchildren's hands has been a real failure.
Indeed, the advertising hurt the Hispanics' feelings because they are Catholics
one hand and on the other hand, it wasn't realistic. Felipe Korznny 20<a
name="fnref20"></a>(<A HREF="#fn20">*</A>) adds that a Latino grandmother would
prefer to die rather than depriving her grandchildren of food.</p>
<p Align=justify>Finally, those who do not consider the various backgrounds and
cultural nuances in their marketing are making a big mistake. Indeed many
marketers tend to put a Korean, a Chinese, a Japanese in the same category
whereas they are very different from each other (the language for example) and
don't have the same needs.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>IV- THE MEANS TO REACH THE NEW AMERICA</strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>A- The history of ethnic advertising</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The arrival of television in the houses conducted the black
community to not only long for respect and equality but for material things as
well, for external signs of wealth proper to white consumers. The Afro
Americans want to reach the American dream as their fellow countrymen. Blitzed
by advertisings and programs made for the white population, black people wish
to be described as full-fledged consumers.</p>
<p Align=justify>It is only since the middle of the sixties that the ethnic
minorities have been represented as consumers in ads, broadcasted in the Media.
During the proslavery period, Afro Americans didn't appear in the advertising
industry which was only for the white population. When the Afro Americans took
their first steps in the advertising campaigns, they were usually represented
as servants, domestics or as matter of distraction for white Americans which
was not benefit for them. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="ethnic-marketing-in-the-united-states2.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=justify>    </p>
<p Align=justify>                                                 An ad for NHM
hotel in 1936</p>
<p Align=justify>Until the immigration Reform Bill in 1965, marketers used to
estimate that the best way to earn money was to target the white population. As
a consequence, the black population was ignored by the Media. In 1963, the
first positive ad for a black appeared in a New York newspaper. It represented
an elegant black man making a call for the New York Telephone Company.  Then
they started to appear in ads for alcohol, tobacco and fast foods.</p>
<p Align=justify>In 1956, Coca Cola Company started to target ethnic groups,
beginning with Afro Americans 21<a name="fnref21"></a>(<A HREF="#fn21">*</A>).
At the end of the sixties, marketers began to wonder whether they had to
represent Afro Americans in mass media or in specialized media like Ebony
magazine. The Black community has then been neglected by the media in favor of
the Hispanic community.</p>
<p Align=justify>  </p>
<p Align=justify><u>Hispanics</u></p>
<p Align=justify><u> </u></p>
<p Align=justify>Since the sixties, Hispanics began to be the favorite ethnic
group for marketers thanks to their rapid growth rate. Conscious of the
language barrier, in 1986, publicists started to translate their advertisings
in Spanish.  </p>
<p Align=justify>Surveys show that the language of Hispanic immigrants on the
American territory is above all their mother tongue. Thereby, in 2000, a study
on Hispanics showed that 58% prefer to speak Spanish rather than English. 80%
speak their native tongue among their family. 4% of Hispanics consult ethnic
Medias and 63% declare to be more likely to buy a product if the advertising
appears in a Hispanic media. </p>
<p Align=justify>Today, the adverts towards the Hispanic market are still few
but the number is expected to increase. Big companies like Chrysler and
Polaroid have increased their advertising campaigns budget.</p>
<p Align=justify>In 2000, the <em>Roslow Research group</em> made a survey with
600 persons. The aim was to prove the effectiveness and the impact of
advertisings in Spanish against English. The result is that an ad in Spanish is
four times more convincing than an ad in English. Latinos remember more ads in
Spanish than in English. As a consequence, the increase of ads in Spanish is
necessary to reach the Hispanic market.</p>
<p Align=justify><u>Afro Americans</u></p>
<p Align=justify>&nbsp;Afro Americans spend 40% more time watching television
than the national average. Thus, they are easy to reach and are more likely to
watch TV adverts. However, if the advert is not directly made for them, it
won't have the same impact. Indeed, according to a survey led by CAB
Multicultural Marketing Resource Center, 56% of Afro Americans are more
attentive to ads where the casting is mainly composed of Blacks.</p>
<p Align=justify><u>Asians</u></p>
<p Align=justify>Asians buy many magazines and news papers. They watch
television in English and in their mother tongue as well. However, they prefer
to watch TV ads in their own language because if an advertiser makes the effort
to speak to them in their language this means that he respects them and see
them as consumers. Thus, an ad in Korean, Chinese or Japanese will be better
kept in mind.</p>
<p Align=justify>However, advertisers only devoted an insignificant part of
their budget to ethnic marketing: 1% according to estimations, a ridiculous
figure especially as the ethnic groups buying power (79 million of Americans
out of 281 millions in 2000) is estimated at $ 1 trillion per year. 22<a
name="fnref22"></a>(<A HREF="#fn22">*</A>)</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>B- The television </strong></p>
<p Align=justify>There exist a great number of ethnic televisions especially
Hispanic televisions.23<a name="fnref23"></a>(<A HREF="#fn23">*</A>) Today,
ethnic minorities are more represented in television ads. According to a survey
realized in the magazine <em>Marketing to the Emerging Majorities</em> (2001),
36% of ads appear with ethnic minorities during primetime in New York City.</p>
<p Align=justify>One commercial break out of three appears with Afro Americans
as a leading role. Asians appear in 6% of the ads and Hispanics appear in 3% of
them. WB and UPN are the television national networks with more ethnic
advertisings. Many ads addressed to ethnic groups are shot by celebrities like
Serena and Venus Williams for Wrigley's gum and Penelope Cruz for a perfume by
Ralph Lauren. </p>
<p Align=justify>This chart represents the percentage of TV ads where appear
the different ethnic groups during primetime. What is obvious is the
predominance of Afro Americans on the small screen. </p>

<p Align=justify>The survey led by <em>Marketing to the Emerging
Majorities</em> revealed also that ads for the Blacks are broadcasted during
the Afro Americans series (54%).</p>
<p Align=justify>The Hispanic community is almost away from advertising during
prime time because on the one hand  it is difficult to distinguish them
physically from the Whites and on the other hand, because they prefer to watch
the Spanish television whereas the Blacks are very close to the American TV
programs. The number of Hispanics who watch television in Spanish grew from 33%
to 39% since the birth of Hispanic television.</p>

<p Align=justify><strong>C- The magazines </strong></p>
<p Align=justify>According to a survey carried out by <em>Marketing to the
emerging majorities</em>&nbsp;over 17 magazines destined to the mass market,
the advertising with ethnic people only represented 19% out of 435
advertisings. They moved to 29% in 1999. </p>
<p Align=justify>We notice that People, Entertainment Weekly, Sports
Illustrated and US Weekly have the biggest number of advertisings targeting the
ethnic communities. The Time magazine, Elle, Ladies Home Journal and Esquire
target less these communities. Entertainment Weekly and Cosmopolitan are both
the only magazines targeting more the ethnic communities in 2001 rather than in
1999 with an increase of 25%. Despite the 39% of advertising towards the ethnic
communities in 1999, the Time magazine doesn't use anymore ethnic advertisings
since 2001. The Oscar awarded actress for <em>Die</em> <em>another day 24<a
name="fnref24"></a>(<A HREF="#fn24">*</A>)</em>, Halle Berry, was the fifth
black to appear on the cover of the Cosmopolitan magazine since 1964, preceded
by the top model Naomi Campbell in 1990. Halle Berry is part of a tiny cadre of
nonwhite celebrities who are considered to have enough crossover appeal to
appear on the cover of mass consumer magazines.</p>
<p Align=justify>According to an article in the New York Times, &#171;even as
black and Hispanic women slowly make their way onto the covers of magazines of
various genres, black males still find themselves mainly confined to a ghetto
of music and sports magazines.&#187;25<a name="fnref25"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn25">*</A>)</p>
<p Align=justify>Since the beginning of the 70s, the number of newspapers for
Hispanic community increased by 219% and the number of radio channels has been
doubled since 1990.</p>

<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc6"></A>V-THE EXCEPTION OF FRANCE</h2>

<p Align=justify>Contrary to other European countries as England, Germany or
Netherlands, France continues to stand up to the temptation of ethnic
marketing. At the origin, France wants the immigrants to assimilate into the
French culture and to adopt the American melting pot concept. </p>
<p Align=justify>The first article of the fifth French Republic Constitution
which specifies that: &#171;&nbsp;<em>La France est une R&eacute;publique
indivisible, la&iuml;que, d&eacute;mocratique et sociale. Elle assure
l'&eacute;galit&eacute; devant la loi de tous les citoyens sans distinction
d'origine, de race ou de religion.&nbsp;&#187; </em>is the first obstacle to
ethnic marketing in France. Indeed, according to Pascal Blanchard, targeting
the other is making a difference. Thus, ethnic marketing runs counter to the
republican principles.</p>
<p Align=justify>It is almost impossible in France to know officially how many
immigrants are on the French territory. It isn't politically correct because
the French Republic only recognizes full-fledged French people no matter what
your race, origin or religion is. There are no official statistics, and no
integration balance sheet. <em>&#171;Il y a un tabou dans ce pays qui consiste
&agrave; dire : si vous cr&eacute;ez des cat&eacute;gories en fonction de
l'origine ethnique, vous stigmatisez le sentiment d'appartenance &agrave; une
communaut&eacute; et vous aurez des revendications de type quotas positifs
&#187; 26<a name="fnref26"></a>(<A HREF="#fn26">*</A>),</em> explains Philippe
Bataillle.</p>
<p Align=justify>It is only since 1992 that a researcher from INED 27<a
name="fnref27"></a>(<A HREF="#fn27">*</A>), Michele Tribalat, published a
survey over immigration in which she talks about new criteria like the ethnic
belonging based on the mother tongue and the criteria of the ethnic origin. She
adds a new category <em>native born Frenchman</em> which triggered a real
controversy among the demographers because they found it racist. Herv&eacute;
Brad, another INSED researcher will say a few years later that the demography
is a new way for racism expression in France.</p>
<p Align=justify>Since this media blitz, there has been no survey in order to
have official figures over immigrants and companies don't take the risk because
they can't evaluate the financial power of the different groups.</p>
<p Align=justify>However, ethnic marketing elbows shyly in France. It is a new
phenomenon, especially since the victory of France during the 1998 World Cup as
the French team is composed of members of ethnic minorities. France is more
heading toward the multicultural marketing this means that all the ethnic
groups are mixed together following the melting pot technique. </p>
<p Align=justify>What is striking is that France welcomes more immigrants than
any other European country, mainly from North Africa (Moroccans, Algerians, and
Tunisians) and from Sub-Saharan Africa. There were already 1 million immigrants
in France in 1881.</p>
<p Align=justify>The Sopi Communication Agency, created in 2003 is the first
pioneer for ethnic marketing in France. It believes in the potential of ethnic
minorities.  </p>
<p Align=justify>In France, the Mecca Cola drink is a good example of ethnic
marketing. &#171;Don't drink idiot, drink committed!&#187;  This drink was
created in 2002 for the North African community and lauds the humanitarian aid.
Another example is the milk <em>laban</em> with Bridel. The only ethnic
television is <em>Beur TV </em>and for the ethnic radio we can find <em>Africa
n&#176;1, Radio Orient, Beur FM </em>and ethnic magazines like Amina for
African women and Yasmina for Arab women. In some supermarkets we can find a
halal 28<a name="fnref28"></a>(<A HREF="#fn28">*</A>) and a kosher 29<a
name="fnref29"></a>(<A HREF="#fn29">*</A>) section.</p>


<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc7"></A>Conclusion</h1>

<p Align=justify>T</p>
<p Align=justify>he advent of ethnic marketing in the 21<sup>st</sup> century
shows the importance of the ethnic markets in the United States and becomes
compulsory for every company who wants to make business and succeed. From 2050,
the ethnic groups will overhaul the white population. A company that doesn't
find any point in reaching them is bound to fail. Yesterday it was interesting
to target them but today it is crucial. Ethnic groups are large enough to whet
any marketer's appetite. However, business remains the main motivation and
consumers are far from being equal for marketers as the more you are rich, the
more you will interest them. The example of John Johnson magnate in the world
of advertising for black people is a good illustration: no discrimination when
there are potential profits. There exist agencies for Asians, Hispanics but not
for Indians for example because they are judged too poor and they represent a
small group in the total population. </p>
<p Align=justify>I have studied throughout this memoire the different marketing
strategies in order to reach these minorities ignored during a long time but it
is still a real challenge for big American companies because they have to
develop their means to speak to them and avoid hurting their sensitiveness by
being awkward in their advertisings.</p>
<p Align=justify>The ethnic diversity is very important in the United States,
indeed there are many ethnic groups like Indians, Israelites, Polishes,
Iranians...but I focused on the three main groups. Companies must increasingly
appeal to minority groups and reflect their cultural preferences to succeed. To
remain successful marketers have to create advertising that reflects the way
America look today, not yesterday. Even sexuality is taken into account as the
marketers focus also on the gay market.</p>
<p Align=justify>What explains the success of ethnic marketing in the United
States is the fact that the ethnic minorities integrate less and less without
conflict. The founding fathers of America made their best to avoid importing in
America ethnic conflicts. In order to reach this goal, their main obsession was
to earn money. The British writer Samuel Johnson declared that humans are never
more harmless than when they are busy in earning money. </p>
<p Align=justify>The case of France is very interesting because as the United
States, France counts a great number of immigrants but isn't ready to adopt
ethnic marketing and doesn't find a point in wooing the ethnic groups despite
the small efforts.</p>
<p Align=justify>In this era of the <em>browning of America 30<a
name="fnref30"></a>(<A HREF="#fn30">*</A>), </em>at a time where a black might
become the President of the United States during the 2008 presidential
campaign, Barack Obama might be more representative, thanks to his Caucasian
and Afro American origins, of the multicultural society that makes today's
United States.</p>
