<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc0"></A>ABSTRACT</h1>

<p Align=justify>In sales contracts, consumers are protected on a multilevel
basis. Indeed, European rules, in particular the Directive of 1999 on certain
aspect of the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantee, stand alongside
the provisions of Member States themselves.</p>
<p Align=justify>At the national level, the form and the content of consumer
protection vary greatly. In France, the system of latent defect and
&#171;garantie des vices caches&#187; appears to be complicated and is not
designed for consumers' use. Conversely, in the UK, consumers are granted with
a right to reject faulty goods on which they can efficiently rely. As a matter
of fact, these differences have not been lessened by the Directive of 1999
which provides for minimal harmonisation.</p>
<p Align=justify>The Commission observes that this practice of minimal
harmonisation has led to the fragmentation of the regulatory framework in
Europe. This is contrary to its goals to strengthen the internal market by
increasing cross-border transactions and reinforcing consumer confidence. This
is why it has launched on 2008 a Proposal on consumer rights providing for a
full harmonisation Directive. However, both this method and the Proposal's
content itself appear to lead to a great decrease in consumer protection. In
addition, the Proposal fails in achieving the other objectives it has been
assigned.</p>

<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc4"></A>CONCLUSION</h1>

<p Align=left><strong>CONSUMER SALES AND GUARANTEES IN</strong></p>
<p Align=center><strong>EUROPE</strong></p>
<p Align=center><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>&#171;<em>The beauty of the Single Market is that by removing
barriers we should not have to choose between business and consumer interests
</em>&#187;<sup>1</sup>. Made the 15 March 2010 by V. Reding during a speech in
Madrid, this statement replaces consumer protection in the context of the
internal market. Indeed, from the European Union's perspective, the balance to
be stricken between consumer protection and business interests is assessed
through its ability to strengthen the internal market. More importantly, the
belief that this particular method eludes the traditional scheme opposing
consumer protection one the one hand and economic interests on the other is at
the core of the European Community's reasoning. This statement also shows that
economic issues lay at the basis of the European Union's action on the field of
consumer. This explains the content and the form of the European regulation as
regard consumers.</p>
<p Align=center>Before going any further, the reasons why consumers are ought
to be protected<br>should be recalled. When contracting with professional,
consumers are deemed to be<br>in a weaker position than the other party. This
is mostly due to their lack of</p>
<p Align=justify>information and to the fact that in modern transactions, most
contracts are contracts of adhesion which cannot be negotiated. Thus, rules
generally aim at providing more information to consumers, at offering them a
right of withdrawal from the contract or at giving them particular and more
generous grounds on which they can base their claim.</p>
<p Align=justify>This being in mind, it shall be precised that consumer
contracts are amongst the most common contracts which take place on a daily
basis. In other words, more than concerning everyone, consumer contracts are at
the basis of consumers' consumption, which is to say one of the driving forces
of our modern economy . As such, providing that a law efficiently protecting
consumers can strengthen their confidence and thus induce them to consume, we
understand why the European Union sees consumer law as a matter of economic
significance. As such, sales contracts are one of the areas where consumer
protection is of great significance.</p>
<p Align=justify>In Europe, consumer sales are regulated both at the European
level, in particular through the Directive of 1999 on certain aspect of the
sale of consumer goods and associated guarantee<sup>2</sup>, and at the
national one by each Member States. However, this fragmented regulatory
framework is criticised by the Commission as preventing business from providing
goods and services in other Member States and as undermining consumers' market
3</p>
<p Align=left>confidence in the internal . This is why the</p>
<p Align=center>Commission published a <em>Green Paper on the Review of the
Consumer Acquis </em>on<br>2006 which was followed on October 2008 by a
Proposal for a Directive of the</p>
<p Align=right>4</p>
<p Align=center>European Parliament and the Coun cil on Consumer Rights (the
Proposal) . The<br>Proposal's most striking feature is the fact that it
provides for a full harmonisation</p>
<p Align=justify>Directive. As such, if it was adopted, Member States would not
be allowed to maintain or introduce in their own legal system any law which
would provide for a different level of protection, even more generous, as the
one laid down in the Proposal.</p>
<p Align=justify>The Proposal has been the object of many articles and
attracted many critiques. This great interest can be explained by the fact that
it provides for a system whereby Member States would lose a part of their
sovereignty over the regulation of consumers. Even more, as it stands know, the
Proposal threaten some existing rules already provided for by Member States
such as the French syst em of latent defect and the UK's right of rejection. As
consumer contract law goes at the heart of many legal systems, these
consequences are regarded with circumspection and all details of the Proposal's
content are closely analysed<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left>6</p>
<p Align=left>Even though the Pr oposal gathers existing Directives</p>
<p Align=left>four regulating a wide area of</p>
<p Align=justify>consumers' contracts, the scope of this work is narrower as it
only concerns sales contracts and, more precisely, consumers' rights when
confronted to a faulty or nonconforming good. As this work will only concern
consumers' <em>legal </em>protection, commercial guarantees are excluded from
its scope. In addition, we will only focus on the French and the UK's legal
framework as well as on the Proposal currently debated.</p>
<p Align=center>It will be seen that generally speaking, where the law
generally misses its point is by<br>not acknowledging the fact that in
practice, consumers are generally reluctant to<br>defend their rights in front
of a judge. Indeed, to put it concretely, a consumer</p>
<p Align=right>confronted to a problem with the 40 euros coffee-maker he
purchased will most</p>
<p Align=left>7</p>
<p Align=justify>certainly not be willing to go to courtas the time and the
costs involved in such process do not worth the trouble of so
doing<sup>8</sup>. Moreover, consumers are generally speaking largely unaware
of their rights and, when some of them are known, they are often
misunderstood<sup>9</sup>. Thus, it is here submitted that a good law
protecting consumers should be clear enough to be understandable by lay people
and should in the same time be usable by them without any judge's help. That
would put them on an equal footing when contracting with professionals.</p>
<p Align=justify>Accordingly, keeping in mind these practical concerns, the
main question underlying this whole work is the following one: how good are the
current and upcoming provisions protecting consumers in sales contracts?</p>
<p Align=center>As a matter of fact, the English approach of consumer
protection is more practical</p>
<p Align=left>10</p>
<p Align=left>and more in line with the considerations</p>
<p Align=left>above . Indeed, analyses of the concrete</p>
<p Align=justify>obstacles standing on the way of consumers confronted to
faulty goods have been undertaken<sup>11</sup> and it will be demonstrated that
the English legal system appears to be more adapted to consumers. Conversely,
the French system provides for highly technical rules which set a theoretically
fair balance between buyers and sellers. It will be showed, however, that these
provisions appear to be, to say the least, unwieldy for consumers [I]. Finally,
the Proposal is also concerned with some of the weaknesses affecting national
laws. However, its main shortcoming concerns the effects it has on these rules
and the level of protection already granted to consumers by Member States
[II].</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc5"></A>I. The current regime in France and in the UK</h2>

<p Align=justify>As buyers are most of the time the weaker party when
purchasing goods, Member States have long recognised that they are ought to be
adequately protected against the stronger bargaining power of the professional
seller they are contracting with. As such, all Member States have rules
regulating buyer sales and guarantees, and sometimes rules regulating more
precisely consumer sales and guarantees. However, as these rules were sometimes
deemed to be too low in certain countries and to impede the development of the
internal market, the EU decided to provide for a minimum set of protection that
all Member States would have to reach, providing that they were however allowed
to go further in the protection granted to consumers if they wished
to<sup>12</sup>. Thus, following the Green Paper on Guarantees for Consumer
Goods and After-Sales Services published by the Commission in
1993<sup>13</sup>, the Directive on certain aspect of the sale of consumer
goods and associate guarantees (the Directive) was launched in
1999<sup>14</sup>, all Member States being in charge of transposing it.</p>
<p Align=justify>Amongst Member States, such transposition led to different
difficulties, controversies and solutions depending on national traditions,
cultures and legal systems. Consequently, measures of transposition varied
greatly between Member States. Some chose the &#171;great solution&#187;
(&#171;<em>la grande solution</em><sup>15</sup>&#187;), a full reform leading
to a monist regime as regard the regulation of all sales contracts, as Germany
for instance<sup>16</sup>. Conversely, some chose the &#171;small
solution&#187; (&#171;<em>la solution de transposition
minimaliste</em><sup>17</sup>&#187;) leading to a dual regime, as France and
the UK for instance. Indeed,</p>
<p Align=justify>both in France and in the UK, the Directive was transposed by
adding specific rules applicable to consumers in addition to those already
existing for all buyers and which remained mostly unaffected.</p>
<p Align=justify>Such way of transposing, though allowed and having the
advantage to protect national legal systems, implies a pilling up of
legislations which is questionable in terms of clarity and intelligibility.
Indeed, in France for instance, consumers have the choice between the
regulation coming from the Directive and the general law of contract. Such
piling up of regulations leads to complexity, incoherence as regard notions
which definition differs depending on the law and confusion as regard
applicable regimes<sup>18</sup>. In addition, overlaps between national and
European regulations, called &#171;double-banking&#187;<sup> 19,</sup> are to
be avoided for the sake of easy-understanding and easy -access to law which are
primordial issues in the field of consumer protection.</p>
<p Align=justify>This part is aimed at giving an overview of the rules
currently regulating consumers throughout France and the UK. More precisely,
national rules and European rules (the Directive) will be differentiated. As
regard national rules, it will be demonstrated that both legal systems have
different views on the ways consumers are best protected. Indeed, whereas civil
law countries' rules are drafted to ensure that parties perform their
obligation as agreed, common law countries focus instead on the termination of
the contract if it is not been honoured as specified<sup>20</sup> . Both in its
content and method, the efficiency of the UK's method as regard the French one
will be demonstrated.</p>
<p Align=justify>As regard the Directive, it is important to note straight away
that a Proposal for a reform of the rules regulating consumers, including
consumer sales and guarantees, has been launched in 2008 21 . The content of
the Proposal is not strictly speaking so different from the content of the 1999
Directive which content will be further analyzed from a more critical
perspective (<em>II. The Proposal for a Directive on consumer rights </em>). As
a result, we will only give an overview of the rules laid down in the Directive
(A) before detailing the national rules applicable both in France (B) and in
the UK (C).</p>
<p Align=left><strong>A. The Directive of 1999 on certain aspect of the sale of
consumer goods and associated guarantees</strong></p>
<p Align=left>22</p>
<p Align=justify>After 15 years of discussions and debates , the Directive of
1999 was finally adopted with the objective to provide for a high degree of
consumer protection in Europe and to promote the internal market, as stated
right at the beginning of the text<sup>23</sup>. To fulfill its objective, the
Directive draws upon different sources, most importantly the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods<sup>24</sup> and,
subsidiary, the British legal system and some principles of civil law 25 .</p>
<p Align=left>26</p>
<p Align=left>The Directive only provides for harmonisation</p>
<p Align=left>minimum . Minimum harmonisation</p>
<p Align=justify>means that Member States must follow the Directive's
provisions as a minimum set of protection for consumers but are allowed to
maintain or to create rules which provide for a better protection<sup>27</sup>.
As a consequence, there are divergences between the provisions stated in the
Directive and the rules implemented by Member States</p>
<p Align=left>when transposing it. Thus, as the Directive has not been
transposed exactly as it</p>
<p Align=left>28</p>
<p Align=justify>stands by Membe r States which all provided for some
modifications , this part only aims at describing the main features of the
Directive's rules. A more critical assessment of the rules it lays down will be
carried out when detailing the measures of transposition in France and in the
UK.</p>
<p Align=center>The Directive does not regulate all aspects of consumer sales
and guarantees. As an<br>example, no rules about damages are provided for by
the Directive and this matter is</p>
<p Align=left>29</p>
<p Align=justify>thus to be ruled by Member States national laws . As a matter
of fact, the two most important parts of the Directive are the provisions
concerning the non-conformity (1) and the remedies available for consumers
(2).</p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc6"></A>1. Non-conformity</h3>

<p Align=justify>The Directive provides that all goods have to be in conformity
with the contract of sale<sup>30</sup>. More precisely, the Directive provides
that goods are deemed to be conforming if they comply with four criterions
listed in article 2(2) of the Directive. These criterions are cumulative and
consumers only have to prove that one of them is not fulfilled to prove
non-conformity. Thus, goods must 31:</p>

<blockquote>
<p Align=left>&#183;  Comply with the descriptions given by the seller and, if
applicable, comply with the sample or model presented;</p>
<p Align=left>&#183;  Correspond to the normal use usually made for this kind
of goods;</p>
<p Align=left>&#183;  Correspond to the particular use the consumer intends to
make with the goods as long as such particular use was known by the seller;
and</p>
<p Align=left> </p>
<p Align=justify> <br>&#183; Be of normal quality and perform as expected for
this kind of goods, taking into account their nature and any public statements
about them made by the seller or the producer, in particular in advertising and
labeling.</p>
<p Align=justify> Here, it must be noted that the Directive's notion of
non-conformity does not encompass the situation where the good is delivered in
wrong quantity. In such cases, the remedies applicable would be those of the
Member States themselves<sup>32</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left> In certain cases, the good does not have to comply with the
public statement referred to in the last condition if the seller can prove
that<sup>33</sup>:</p>
<p Align=left>&#183;  He was not aware and could not reasonably be aware of the
public statement;</p>
<p Align=left>&#183;  The statement had been corrected prior to the sell;
and</p>
<p Align=left>&#183;  The consumer's decision could not have been influenced by
the statement.</p>
<p Align=justify> In addition, if the consumer &#171;<em>was aware, or could
not reasonably be unaware</em>&#187; of the lack of conformity or if such lack
of conformity is due to the materials provided by the consumer, then the good
is not deemed to be non-conforming<sup>34</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify> Moreover, it must be proved that non-conformity existed prior
to the sale of the good<sup>35</sup>. However, such proof can be very difficult
to provide, especially when dealing with complex goods such as laptops or cars.
Thus, except if they resort to an expert, either consumers or sellers will have
trouble to prove that a particular breakdown is due to a misuse from the
consumer or from a defect which already existed before the sale. Therefore,
albeit balancing consumers and sellers' interests is a matter of the</p>
<p Align=left> </p>
<p Align=justify> finest alchemy, as regard the issue of proof it can be said
that the Directive successfully takes over this challenge. Indeed, during the
first sixth months following the delivery of the goods all problems affecting
them are deemed to result from a defect which already existed moment of the
purchase 36</p>
<p Align=left> the</p>
<p Align=left> at . Even though the seller</p>
<p Align=justify> can still prove the contrary, in particular if such
presumption is not compatible with the nature of the good (a lettuce for
instance) or the lack of conformity (the good's defect obviously flows from a
misuse by the consumer)<sup>37</sup>, this provision will most of the time
allows the consumer to claim for a remedy without any contest. Conversely,
after the first sixth months, the consumer has the burden to prove that the
good was non-conforming prior to its purchase.</p>
<p Align=left> In addition, it is important to note that sellers are liable for
the non-conformity of the goods they two the delivery 38</p>
<p Align=left> sell only during a period of after</p>
<p Align=left> years ir . Moreover, the</p>
<p Align=center> Directive provides that consumers must inform the sellers of
any lack of conformity</p>
<p Align=right> 39</p>
<p Align=justify> within a period of two months following the revealing of such
lack of conformity . As it will be highlighted later, these limitations are
rather harsh and have, in fact, seldom been transposed by Member States.</p>
<p Align=left> As soon as non-conformity is established, consumers are entitled
to remedies.</p>

<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc7"></A> 2. Remedies</h3>

<blockquote>
<p Align=left> The Directive not contain any provision regard damages 40</p>
<p Align=left> does as . For other</p>
<p Align=left> remedies, the Directive offers consumers select 41</p>
<p Align=left> four choices they can . What is</p>
<p Align=left> rather new compared to the Member States' existing legal
framework is the hierarchy</p>
<p Align=left>  42</p>
<p Align=center> provided by the directive . This distinctive feature show that
the Directive is before<br>all aimed at ensuring the performance of the
contract by giving to sellers, in case of</p>
<p Align=right> 43</p>
<p Align=justify> failure, the opportunity to solve the problem and make the
goods conforming . More precisely, remedies are organised in two tiers, repair
or replacement first (a) and rescission or reduction of price then (b).</p>
<p Align=left> a. Repair and replacement</p>
<p Align=justify> In case of non-conforming goods, consumers have first the
choice between repair and replacement<sup>44</sup>. However, albeit this choice
has to be done by consumers, sellers have the final word since they can refuse
the remedy chosen on the ground that it is impossible or disproportionate and
can then carry out the other remedy (replacement or repair, as the case may be)
45.</p>
<p Align=justify> A remedy is deemed to be disproportionate if it entails u
nreasonable costs on the seller<sup>46</sup>. To assess such unreasonable
costs, article 3(3) of the Directive specifies that the value of the good (if
it was conforming), the importance of the lack of conformity and the existence
of alternative remedies which do not cause significant inconvenience to
consumers are taken into account. As an example, a seller can refuse to replace
a car with a slight defect (defective lights for instance) which can be easily
fixed without any inconvenience and can choose instead to repa ir it. In this
example, replacing a car because its lights are merely broken is obviously
disproportionate. However, it is important to keep in mind that most of the
time, regardless of the defect affecting the good, the seller will prefer to
repair it rather than replace it, mostly for financial reasons. It is thus
important that consumers have the</p>
<p Align=left>  choice at first and that this choice can only be amended in
case of impossibility or disproportion, which have to be demonstrated.</p>
<p Align=center> Once the remedy has been cho sen, the seller must carry it out
free of charge, this<br>being seen quite broadly since it involves the cost
related to postage, labour and<br>materials<sup>47</sup>. In addition, the
seller must carry out the remedy within a reasonable time</p>
<p Align=left> 48</p>
<p Align=center> and without any great inconveni ence for the consumer . The
reasonable time and<br>great inconvenience must be assessed as regard the
nature of the good and the</p>
<p Align=left> 49</p>
<p Align=justify> purpose for which the consumer required the good . As an
example, whereas a car's light can be expected to be repaired in a couple of
days, it usually takes longer to repair a laptop as it often has to be sent to
a special repair shop.</p>
<p Align=center> If the consumer is not entitled to repair or replacement,
presumably when these</p>
<p Align=left> 50</p>
<p Align=justify> remedies are impossible or disproportionate , or if the
remedy chosen has not been achieved within a reasonable period of time or
without great inconvenience, the consumer can claim for a price reduction or a
rescission of the contract<sup>51</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left> b. Rescission and reduction of price</p>
<p Align=justify> First of all, it is worth noting that the Directiv e is
rather lapidary on these remedies. As an example, the Directive only provides
that rescission is not available if the lack of conformity is
minor<sup>52</sup> but does not give any definition of rescission or any
guidance as to the consequences of such remedy and the ways to carry it out.
This is rather surprising as such remedy leads to the termination of the
contract and as, in practice, a lot of disputes arise on the consequences
attached to it<sup>53</sup>. This lack of precision</p>
<p Align=left>  shows the importance given by the Directive to the performance
of the contract rather than its termination.</p>
<p Align=justify> Conversely, in case of reduction of price, the consumer keeps
the good but is entitled to &Ograve;<em>an appropriate reduction of the
price</em>&Oacute;<sup>54</sup>. It seems to be fair to consider that this sum
of money should be the difference between what has actually been paid and what
would have been paid by the consumer for the defective good<sup>55</sup>.
However, here again, no precisions is provided by the Directive.</p>
<p Align=center> <strong>B. The current regime in France - A fragmented
regulatory<br>framework</strong></p>
<p Align=justify> Contrary to the UK<sup>56</sup>, in France, many debates
arose as regard the best way to transpose the Directive of 1999. Indeed, some
authors claimed that the Directive should be transposed as part of a broad
reform of the Civil Code modifying and simplifying the general lawof sale 57 .
However, most authors supported another view and argued that a transposition
<em>a minima </em>providing for a new regime would be the most adequate
solution. They declared that as such, the new law created would naturally fit
in the Consumer Code (Code de la consommation) and were opposed to any
amendment to the Civil Code<sup>58</sup>. Indeed, as a matter of fact, in
France, the Civil Code is seen as a national pride and few authors actually
dare to suggest its amendment. All these disputes led to a delay in the
transposition of the Directive which was condemned by the European Court of
Justice (ECJ) the 1 July 2004<sup>59</sup>. On</p>
<p Align=left>  2004<sup>60</sup>, it was finally decided to transpose the
Directive in the Consumer Code and,<br>accordingly, this process led to the
adoptio n of Ordinance of 17 2005 61</p>
<p Align=left> the February</p>
<p Align=left> which offers to consumers a new set of rules on which they can
base their claim<sup>62</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify> What was at the core of the arguments dividing the doctrine
was the relevance of the dual regime existing between latent defect (garantie
des vices cach&eacute;s) and what is called in France &#171;obligation de
d&eacute;liverance conforme&#187; or &#171;garantie de conformit&eacute;&#187;
(conforming delivery). Pursuant to article 1603 of the Civil Code 63 , both
obligations have to be complied with by all sellers but remain by nature
different. Put it simply, latent defect refers to the quality of the good
purchased (a defective car which engine does not work for instance) whereas the
&#171;garantie de conformit&eacute;&#187; refers to the good's compliance with
the contract's specifications (a yellow car instead of the red car described in
the contract for example). This distinction was the stumbling-block dividing
authors as some of them believed it unnecessary, complicated and
irrelevant<sup>64</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>As a matter of fact, with the legal regime coming from the
Directive of 1999 which adds a new lay to the existing and confusing dual
system set in the Civil Code, overlaps and difficulties as regard the handling
of such rules are unavoidable. In addition, other provisions which concern the
general law of contracts, such as misrepresentation or the error about a
substantial quality of the good for instance, can also be used by buyers
willing to escape from a contract which provided them with a non-conforming
good<sup>65</sup>. Thus, it can be said that the French law of sale applicable
to consumers has become dreadfully complicated. That is why there are calling
for a reform simplifying the law of sale in general<sup>66</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left> </p>
<p Align=justify> As latent defects and the &#171;garantie de
conformit&eacute;&#187; are applicable to all buyers, from lay people to
transnat ional companies, the rules are not especially designed for consumers
and are unwieldy to use as regard daily transactions concerning low or
medium-value goods. Moreover, the complexity pertaining to both regimes is
highly questionable since it is confusing for consumers. Conversely, as we will
see in next part (<em>C. The current regime in the UK - A unified and efficient
regime</em>), the system currently prevailing in the UK is much simpler and the
regime easier for consumers' use. As a consequence, for the sake of consumers'
understandability, one could think of a <u>single regime</u> especially shaped
for consumers which would draw upon the European notion of non-conformity but
would in any case provide for a better protection. Such system would make it
much easier for consumers to defend their rights in front of sellers.</p>
<p Align=justify> In the scope of this part, we will first analyse the dual
regime laid down in the Civil Code which provide s two grounds on which buyers
can base their claim depending on the nature of the problem affecting the
product: non-conformity to the contract (1) or latent defect (2). Then, we will
have a look at the rules transposing the Directive of 1999 and creating a new
and unique regime of non-conformity (3).</p>
<p Align=center> <strong>1. The &#171;obligation de deliverance
conforme&#187;</strong></p>
<p Align=justify> The &#171;obligation de d&eacute;livrance conforme&#187; is
laid down in the Civil Code from article 1604 to article 1624. As a matter of
fact, the regime has been mostly shaped by judges themselves and is contractual
by nature<sup>67</sup>. If the notion of &#171;obligation de</p>
<p Align=left> </p>
<p Align=justify> d&eacute;livrance conforme&Oacute; is in theory very clear
(a), its distinction from latent defect can in practice be very difficult to
draw (b) and its regime is not designed for consumers&Otilde; use (c).</p>
<p Align=center> a. Notion of &Ograve;obligation de d&eacute;livrance
conforme&Oacute;<br>The &Ograve;obligation de d&eacute;livrance
conforme&Oacute; is an obligation lying on sellers who have to</p>
<p Align=right> 68</p>
<p Align=justify> make sure the good delivered to buyer s conforms with all
contractual specifications . Proving this absence of conformity is easy.
Indeed, as it is an obligation of result (an obligation to c ertain result)
69</p>
<p Align=left> achieve a , it is enough to show that there is a difference</p>
<p Align=justify> between the good's description in the contract and the good
actually put in possession of the buyer<sup>70</sup>. As an example, a watch
which is described as being able to go under water will be non-conforming if it
breaks as soon as it is in contact with water. Even a slight difference is
regarded as a breach of the &#171;obligation de d&eacute;livrance
conforme&Oacute;, as expresse d in two cases delivered the same day by the Cour
de cassation. In the first one, the car&Otilde;s colour was slightly different
from what was depicted and in the second one, the home furnishing's ironworks
were not exactly as described and, aesthetically, the buyer was not
satisfied<sup>71</sup>. In both cases, the goods were considered as being
non-conforming.</p>
<p Align=justify> Furthermore, it is important to note that as the
&Ograve;obligation de d&eacute;livrance conforme&Oacute; is part of the
contract's execution, it encompasses situations where the seller does not
provide the goods, provides the wrong quantity of goods or provides them with a
delay.</p>
<p Align=left> </p>
<p Align=center> b. Distinction with latent defect</p>
<p Align=justify> At first sight, the &#171;garantie de conformit&eacute;&#187;
and latent defects are easily distinguishable from each other. As an example, a
table which is in plastic instead of wood would be regarded as non-conforming.
Conversely, if the table is, as agreed, in wood but is full of woodworms, then
it contains a latent defect. However, such clarity can be blown on both a
theoretical and a practical ground. First, it can be said that a good which is
flawed is a non-conforming good since a buyer would obviously not agree to
purchase a faulty item. In other words, as it is self-evident that the good on
which buyers and sellers agree must be free of flaw, if there is in fact a
defect, then the item could be simply regarded as non-conforming. This
reasoning is the one prevailing in the UK where the law provides that there are
implied terms in the contract which prevent buyers from delivering goods which
contain a defect. Moreover, on a practical ground, the distinction made in the
Civil Code can lead to absurd results. Indeed, coming back to our table eaten
away by woodworms, if the buyer especially mentioned in the contract his
willingness to buy furniture which does not contain any woodworms, then the
very same table with the very same defect would be regarded as non -conforming
rather than containing a latent defect.</p>
<p Align=center> As a result, some authors and lawyers have been willing to
merge both concepts.</p>
<p Align=left> 72</p>
<p Align=justify> This so -called monist doctrinewas not only based on
intellectual arguments since the regime attached to latent defect and the
&#171;obligation de d&eacute;livrance conforme&#187; was used to be different,
in particular as regard the period during which a complain could be lodged.
Indeed, whereas a buyer confronted to a non-conforming good could act during
ten years<sup>73</sup>, a buyer discovering a latent defect only had a brief
period (&#171;bref</p>
<p Align=left> </p>
<p Align=justify> d&eacute;lai&Oacute;) to lodge a claim. Thus, whenever buyers
were late to take action, lawyers would allege that the good containing a
latent defect was<em> per se</em> a non-conforming good. As a consequence, they
based their claim on a breach of the &#171;obligation de d&eacute;livrance
conforme&Oacute; instead of latent defect and thus asserted that they were
still on time<sup>74</sup>. For a while, some judges of the Cour de cassation
were convinced and enlarged the notion of &Ograve;obligation de
d&eacute;livrance conforme&Oacute; in order to encompass the notion of latent
defect<sup>75</sup> whereas some other resisted and stick to the traditional
distinction<sup>76</sup>. The definition of the &#171;obligation de
d&eacute;livrance conforme&Oacute; was then not merely non-conformity to the
contract but also non -conformity to the utilisation of the good, which
permitted to include latent defects. However, even though some authors are
still defending this view, this monist conception is now
abandoned<sup>77</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left> c. Regime of the &#171;obligation de d&eacute;livrance
conforme&Oacute;</p>
<p Align=justify> The provisions related to the period during which a claim can
be lodged are rather buyer-friendly (i). However, the regime of the
&Ograve;obligation de d&eacute;livrance conforme&Oacute; as a whole is not
designed for consumers which are likely to face difficulties when using it.
Indeed, albeit the provisions concerning the proof itself are rather clear and
easy to comply with, the importance given to the reception of the good does not
really fit with consumers' interests (ii). Likewise, in practice, the remedies
available are hard to carry out as regard consumers' position (iii).</p>
<p Align=left> </p>
<p Align=center> i. The period during which a claim can be lodged</p>
<p Align=justify> We shall first recall that the &#171;obligation de
d&eacute;livrance conforme&Oacute; is contractual by nature<sup>78</sup>. To
put it concretely, when a seller delivers a non-conforming good, he is in
breach of contract. Thus, it is the statute of limitations as regard contract
law which is applicable. This statute deeply in 2008 79</p>
<p Align=left> has been modified . Before the reform, the</p>
<p Align=center> period to lodge a claim for non-conformity was of 30 years and
was beginning at the</p>
<p Align=left> 81</p>
<p Align=justify> delivery of the good <sup>80</sup>. Since the reform, the
period is of five years and begins when the buyers knew or should have known
the fact permitting them to exercise an action<sup>82</sup>. More precisely,
the period begins at the delivery of the good if the nonconformity is
immediately detectable or at the discovery of the non -conformity if it is
hidden<sup>83</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify> This provision seems to be reasonable as 5 years is a period
long enough to lodge a claim. Moreover, the fact that this period is flexible,
which is to say that it does not begin at the same moment depending on whether
the defect is apparent or not, is an interesting way to strike the balance
between buyers and sellers with more accuracy. As a matter of fact, if the
defect is apparent, it is only fair that the period of time begins at the
delivery of the good. Conversely, when the non-conformity is non-apparent, it
is normal that the period of time begins only at the moment of the discovery of
the non-conformity. Thus, as such, these provisions protect efficiently
consumers who will always have a reasonable time to lodge a claim.</p>
<p Align=center> Finally, in any case, the period during which a buyer is
entitled to lodge a claim for<br>non-conformity is limited by article 2232 of
the Civil Code<sup>84</sup>. Indeed, buyers have a</p>
<p Align=left>  maximum of twenty years to complain from the moment they
purchased the good regardless of the moment they detected the defect.</p>
<p Align=center> ii. The issues pertaining to the proof</p>
<p Align=justify> The notion of &#171;obligation de d&eacute;livrance
conforme&#187; includes both non-performance (when the seller does not provide
any good at all) and non-conforming performance (when the seller provides a
non-conforming good). As a result, the provisions concerning the burden of
proof are dual: sellers have to prove that they have</p>
<p Align=left> 86</p>
<p Align=justify> delivered the g ood to buyers <sup>85</sup> during the agreed
period of deliverywhereas buyers have to prove that the good they have received
does not conform to the contractual specifications<sup>87</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify> Thus, proving the non-conformity or the delivery is not very
burdensome either for consumers or for sellers. Indeed, the former only have to
show the differences existing between the good delivered and the contractual
specifications whereas the latter can easily prove the delivery by ensuring
that all buyers sign a receipt at the reception of the good.</p>
<p Align=justify> However, as regard consumer protection, things get tricky
when the goods purchased are not delivered immediately but later. In this case,
the buyers see the goods for the first time <em>after</em> the conclusion of
the contract and what is called a <u>reception</u> of the goods takes place. In
practice, professionals often ask buyers to sign a receipt stating that the
good if free of apparent defect, sometimes even before the buyer has the time
to proceed to any verification<sup>88</sup>. But even in the absence of such</p>
<p Align=left>  receipt, buyers have nonetheless a duty to examine the goods at
their reception and</p>
<p Align=left> 89</p>
<p Align=justify> have to verify their conformity to the contract . Then, if
they find a defect or a detail from which they can infer that the good might be
non -conforming, they must either express reservations of directly refuse the
good. As an example, the delivery of a green car instead of a white one is
obviously an apparent non-conformity which must be noted by the buyer. The
reservations or refusal have to be given at the reception of the good or
briefly after it<sup>90</sup>. If the buyers accept the good without any
reservations, they will not be able, later on, to complain for any<em>
apparent</em> non-conformity they should have noticed<sup>91</sup>. Such point
has been argued at length in cases law but the judges' position always remained
still<sup>92</sup> . However, if the non-conformity is hidden and cannot be
discovered at the reception, the buyers will still be entitled to lodge a claim
for non-conformity later even though they did not express any reservation at
the reception<sup>93</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify> Such consequences given to the reception of the good are
rather ruthless, especially for consumers who might not know these rules. Such
provisions are understandable in the field of business where there is a need
for rapidity and legal certainty bu t do not seem very useful as regard
consumer sales. Moreover, even though judges have a tendency to be more lenient
with consumers<sup>94</sup>, in practice, some of them are likely to be
unmindful when verifying the good delivered. In addition, consumers might not
dare to protest right away when they detect a non-conformity and may then
exceed the length of time (not detailed but short) allowed to complain. Thus, I
think that these provisions should be removed when the buyers are consumers
since their mere inattention and their ignorance of the applicable rules should
not lead to the lost of all remedies.</p>
<p Align=left> </p>
<p Align=justify> It can be argued that, in the field of consumer sales, the
rules pertaining to reception are not often applicable. Indeed, they only
concern goods delivered to buyers and not those purchased and taken directly at
the store, which is in practice the most common modality. However, it should be
recalled that goods delivered are often expensive and are of those for which
consumers might be willing to take action in case of non-conformity. Thus, the
provisions regarding the reception of goods are of great relevance in the
protection of consumers.</p>
<p Align=center> iii. Remedies available for non-conforming goods</p>
<p Align=justify> It is worth recalling that the &#171;obligation de
d&eacute;livrance&Oacute; conforme is contractual<sup>95</sup>. As such, the
remedies available are those applicable for contract law in general. However,
as diverse and powerful as these remedies are, they remain difficult to handle
for consumers. Indeed, admittedly, what is first striking when looking at the
French remedies English variety 96</p>
<p Align=left> as compared to those providing for in law is their .</p>
<p Align=center> However, in practice, most of the remedies available for lack
of conformity can only<br>be commanded by a judge while consumers are generally
reluctant to spend time</p>
<p Align=left> 97</p>
<p Align=justify> and money going to court unless the good purchased is really
expensive . As a matter of fact, in practice, most difficulties encountered by
consumers concern goods for which they think it does not worth the trouble to
go to court<sup>98</sup>.</p>
<p Align=center> Moreover, except for damages, prior to any claim for remedies,
buyers must first give<br>a formal notice to sellers pointing out the
non-conformity of the good or the non-<br>performance of the
contract<sup>99</sup> . Such formal notice is aimed at warning sellers that</p>
<p Align=left> </p>
<p Align=justify> they have to perform the contract as agreed and gives them
another chance to do so. However, some <em>a priori</em> of formal notice
100</p>
<p Align=justify> situations exclude the given any . Indeed, if a cake is
purchased for a wedding and is not delivered (non-performance) or if a wrong
cake is delivered (non-conformity), then, after the wedding, there is nothing
the seller can do to perform again the contract since no cake is needed anymore
and the wedding is already ruined. Thus, the buyer can ask directly for a
remedy. But except in these kinds of situation , the necessity to give a formal
notice is rather heavy and works as a disincentive for buyers, especially
consumers, confronted to nonconforming goods and willing to obtain remedies.</p>
<p Align=left> 101</p>
<p Align=justify> Buyers who have the choice amongst all remedies made
available to them . This is important as they can select the one which best fit
to their situation and which is the most adequate to solve their problem.</p>
<p Align=justify> Generally speaking, the remedies available for buyers are
aimed at ensuring the proper performance of the contract by the sellers
(&aacute;), those leading to its termination being seen as last resort remedies
(&acirc;)<sup>102</sup>. In any case, damages are available regardless of the
remedy chosen (&atilde;)<sup>103</sup>.</p>
<p Align=center> &aacute;. Remedies encouraging the right performance of the
contract</p>
<p Align=justify> Remedies which do not lead to the destruction of the contract
and induce its performance are the withholding of performance, specific
performance, replacement and price reduction.</p>
<p Align=left>   The withholding of performance (&#171;exception
d'inex&eacute;cution&#187;)</p>
<p Align=left> Intellectually speaking, it is considered that the sell er must
first perform the contract</p>
<p Align=left> 104</p>
<p Align=justify> before any payment is due by the buyer . Thus, albeit the
Civil Code does not explicitly provides for it, if the seller does not deliver
the good or if he delivers a nonconforming good, the buyer is allowed to retain
payment until the contract is performed as agreed 105 . Moreover, the
withholding of performance needs not be ordered by a judge so buyers can use it
as they want, the only condition being that the non-performance or the
non-conforming performance of the sellers must be serious. Thus, such remedy
seems at first sight to be rather strong and to be an efficient incentive
encouraging the sellers' performance.</p>
<p Align=justify> However, in contracts concluded between consumers and
professionals, the consumer is often required to pay prior to the delivery of
the good. Thus, in practice, the withholding of performance is not used by
consumers.</p>
<p Align=left>  Specific performance (&#171;ex&eacute;cution en nature&#187;)
and constraint (&#171;astreinte&#187;)</p>
<p Align=left> Specific performance is a remedy laid down in article 1610 of
the Civil Code which obligate which contract 106</p>
<p Align=left> s the seller to deliver a</p>
<p Align=left> good conforms to the or, if it is not</p>
<p Align=center> possible, an equivalent good<sup>107</sup>. Specific
performance is thus a very powerful remedy</p>
<p Align=left> 108</p>
<p Align=justify> since it can lead to the replacement of the good or its
reparation . In addition, when commanding specific performance, the judge can
even force the seller to perform under constraint<sup>109</sup>. This means
that the seller will have to pay a sum of money per day, week or month until
compliance with the judge's instruction is fully met 110 .</p>
<p Align=left> </p>
<p Align=justify> However, constraint is in practice rarely ordered in
consumers' sales as it is limited to the business field . Moreover, specific
performance is a judiciary remedy and, as already highlighted, consumers
usually do not take the trouble to go at court to defend their rights unless
the good is of great value.</p>
<p Align=left>  Replacement</p>
<p Align=left> Replacement is a remedy rather unknown and its name is in fact
quite misleading.</p>
<p Align=left> 111</p>
<p Align=justify> Indeed, it is not the good which is replaced but the other
party . To put it concretely, a buyer confronted to the non-performance of the
contract by the seller (seller 1) can ask another seller (seller 2) to provide
him with the good<sup>112</sup>. What is very interesting is that the buyer
does not have to pay seller 2 since it is seller 1 who has to make such
payment. However, providing that only a judge can allow for replacement, here
again, this remedy does not fit for consumers and is in practice only used
between professionals.</p>
<p Align=left>  Price reduction (&#171;r&eacute;faction&#187; or <em>action
quanti minoris</em>)</p>
<p Align=justify> This remedy is not provided for in the Civil Code but has
been made available, after many hesitations 113 , by judges 114 . Thus, in
practice, its regime is rather unclear depending on whether the good is
non-conforming or whether the sel ler has merely not performed his
obligation<sup>115</sup>. At first sights, it seems that this remedy is more in
line with consumers' interests and the Directive of 1999 also provides for it.
However,</p>
<p Align=left>  conversely to the Directive's system, price reduction has to be
commanded by a judge, which is, again, problematic as regard consumers.</p>
<p Align=center> &acirc;. Remedy leading to the termination of the contract:
resolution</p>
<p Align=justify> Buyers confronted to a non-conforming good are entitled to
claim for resolution of the contract<sup>116</sup>. Resolution leads to the
termination of the contract with retroactive effects. More precisely, parties
are deemed to be in the situation they would have been if they had never
contracted. Thus, the buyer has to give back the good purchased and the seller
the price paid for it by the buyer. The regime of resolution is rather
buyer-friendly since they do not have to return the good but only have to make
it available to the seller. Moreover, sellers cannot ask for an indemnity on
the ground that the buyer used the good<sup>117</sup> or for the wear and tear
caused by the utilisation of the good<sup>118</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify> As regard these consequences, such remedy is very powerful
for buyers and works as an incentive for sellers who do not want to lose all
benefits arising from the contract. However, it has to be noted that unless
specifically allowed in the contract, which is in practice unusual in consumer
sales, resolution has to be decided by a judge. Moreover, to be allowed by
judges, the non-conformity or the nonperformance to the contract must not be
trivial and must reach a certain level of</p>
<p Align=left> gravity 119120</p>
<p Align=justify> . Even though the level of gravit y required is not very high
, such remedy is uneasy to carry out for consumers. As a comparison, the
resolution provided for in article L. 114-1 of the Consumer Code (created by
the transposition of the Directive of 1999) is automatic and consumers need not
see a judge<sup>121</sup>. Likewise, the English</p>
<p Align=left> </p>
<p Align=justify> system provides consumers with a right to terminate the
contract which can be used without any judge's help. Thus, here again, the
French remedy seems at first glance to be interesting but, when closely
analysed, appears to be unwieldy for consumers.</p>
<p Align=center> &atilde;. Damages<br>In the French legal system, the integral
compensation for any prejudice suffered is</p>
<p Align=left> 122</p>
<p Align=justify> set up as a principle . Thus, damages cover a wide area and
can repair virtually all losses endured by the consumers<sup>123</sup>
including those related to the delay until the right performance of the
contract is done<sup>124</sup>, the reparation carried out by a third-party to
render the good conforming<sup>125</sup>, the difference in terms of value
between the good delivered and the conforming good expected<sup>126</sup> or
even moral damages.</p>
<p Align=center> To obtain damages, buyers must prove that the prejudice they
suffered is certain,</p>
<p Align=left> 128</p>
<p Align=justify> foreseeable <sup>127</sup> and that it has been caused by the
lack of conformity . These conditions are usually easy to fulfill and a
consumer who suffered a prejudice will not, in practice, have any difficulty to
obtain a full compensation for the prejudice he suffered as a consequence of
this non-conformity. Here again, damages have to be granted by a judge.
However, this is a normal modality as such remedy could not work without a
judge.</p>
<p Align=center> <strong>2. Latent defect</strong></p>
<p Align=center> The regime of latent defect, also called hidden defect,
originated in Roman law where<br>it was especially created to regulate the sale
of slaves and animals since these kinds</p>
<p Align=left>  of sellers swindlers 129</p>
<p Align=left> were as</p>
<p Align=left> seen . Until the XXth century, it had a limited role and</p>
<p Align=justify> was rather unused. However, with the development of
consumption and the increasing in goods' complexity which makes it harder for a
buyer to detect a problem affecting a good, latent defect experienced a growing
use.</p>
<p Align=justify> Latent defect has been laid down in the Civil Code since the
beginning and can be found from article 1641<sup>130</sup> to article 1649. As
such, the regime of latent defect is available for all buyers. However, it is
worth noting that prior to the ordinance of 2005 which transposed the Directive
of 1999, article L. 211 -1<sup>131</sup> of the Consumer Code provided
specifically that the regime of latent defect was applicable for consumers and
reproduced <em>verbatim </em>the corresponding articles of the Civil Code.</p>
<p Align=justify> The notion of latent defect is seen as complementary to the
&#171;obligation de d&eacute;livrance conforme&#187;. Indeed, as the latter
makes sure that the buyers is provided with conforming goods, the former
ensures that the buyers can fully enjoy these goods since they must be free of
flaws. If the notion of latent defect is rather easy to understand (a),
regrettably, its regime is not shaped for consumers' use (b).</p>
<p Align=left> a. The notion of latent defect</p>
<p Align=justify> Firs of all, it is worth noting that latent defect is a
guarantee due by the seller to the buyer and does not have any contractual
basis. The notion of latent defect refers to the quality of the good. More
precisely, the good delivered must not contain any hidden defect preventing the
buyer from using it. The notion of latent defect is best</p>
<p Align=left>  described by detailing the four conditions a flow must
fulfilled to be regarded as a hidden defect.</p>
<p Align=left> i. The <em>existence </em>of a defect</p>
<p Align=left> A defect is a flaw which affects the utility of the good or
decreases so much its potential use that the buyer would not have acquired it
or would have purchased it for</p>
<p Align=left> 132</p>
<p Align=justify> a much lower price . As an example, a coffee-maker which is
unable to make coffee or a car which brakes are not working would both be
considered as containing a latent the good 133</p>
<p Align=left> defect. The defect is ascertained as regard norm use</p>
<p Align=left> al of the , not</p>
<p Align=center> the particular use a buyer might make of it<sup>134</sup>.
However, if such specific use is known<br>by the seller<sup>135</sup> or if the
good is sold especially for a specific purpose, then the defect<br>will be
determined with regard to this particular use<sup>136</sup>. As an example, a
dog sold for</p>
<p Align=left> reproduction is not expected to have the same pet 137</p>
<p Align=left> qualities as a dog sold as a .</p>
<p Align=left> Generally speaking, proving the <em>existence </em>of a defect
is not difficult.</p>
<p Align=left> ii. A defect affecting the <em>utilisation </em>of the good</p>
<p Align=justify> The defect must affect the utilisation of the good, which is
to say that it must not be too slight<sup>138</sup>. As an example, a car which
is a bit noisy when driven in reverse would most likely not be considered as
defective. It is important to note that the gravity of the defect is assessed
in a different way depending upon the remedy requested by the buyer. Indeed,
judges are likely to be stricter when evaluating the seriousness of the flaw if
the buyer asks for the resolution of the contract rather than a price</p>
<p Align=left>  reduction<sup>139</sup>. However, consumers who are in good
faith generally do not have problems in showing that the defect is serious
enough.</p>
<p Align=left> iii. A<em> hidden</em> defect</p>
<p Align=left> This condition is the <em>non-apparent </em>140</p>
<p Align=left> double. First, must</p>
<p Align=left> defect be , as a laptop which</p>
<p Align=justify> cannot go on the internet for example. Being
non-professional, consumers are not required to inspect the good but only to be
reasonably caution when purchasing<sup>141</sup>.<sup> </sup>Thus, no judge
would expect a consumer to verify that a lawn mower is in practice able to cut
the grass for instance. As such, except if they are acting in bad faith, buyers
will not have problem as regard the fact that the flaw must be non-apparent.</p>
<p Align=left> defect must be buyer 142</p>
<p Align=left> Moreover , the also <em>unknown </em>from the . Indeed, if the
latter</p>
<p Align=justify> actually knows that the television he is purchasing can only
provides the programs in black and white, he or she cannot complain on such
ground later. The buyer is presumed to be unaware of the defect affecting the
good and it is the seller who has to prove that such flaw was already known
purchasing 143</p>
<p Align=justify>  by the buyer when . Thus, here again, consumers acting in
good faith will generally not face any problem as regard their ignorance of the
flaw.</p>
<p Align=left> iv. A defect<em> anterior</em> to the purchase</p>
<p Align=center> Finally, the defect must exist prior to the purchase of the
good and, more precisely,</p>
<p Align=left> 144</p>
<p Align=left> before the property over the good transferred</p>
<p Align=left> is . On this matter, it is important to</p>
<p Align=center> distinguish the origin of the defect from the moment when it
manifests. As an</p>
<p Align=left> </p>
<p Align=justify> example, if an animal becomes ill after its purchase but it
can be proved that the virus which caused the illness was already in the
animal's blood before it was bought, then the buyer can claim that there is a
latent defect. However, the proof of the anteriority has to be provided by the
buyer, which is in practice very difficult unless the defect</p>
<p Align=left> 145</p>
<p Align=center> appeare d very quickly after the purchase of the good .
Indeed, even though there is<br>no presumption as regard the anteriority
existence of the defect, as it is the case in<br>the Directive of 1999, in
practice, judges infer the existence of a latent defect from the</p>
<p Align=left> 146</p>
<p Align=justify> fact that the problem appeared soon after the good has been
bought . To put it concretely, consumers experiencing problems soon after they
have bought a good will generally no have problem to prove that the defect
existed priori to the purchase.</p>
<p Align=justify> In other cases, in practice, an expert is often used in order
to prove that the defect was already latent in the good before its
purchase<sup>147</sup>. Such necessity can be very onerous for buyers since
they have to pay for the expert and are reimbursed only if they win the case.
Thus, in practice, consumers can be deterred from going to court and ask for an
expert's evaluation. Indeed, a fair quantity of problems encountered by
consumers concern inexpensive goods which worth neither the trouble nor the
costs of asking an expert to prove the anteriority of the defect.</p>
<p Align=left> However, if buyers can prove that the problem affecting the good
fulfills these four conditions, they will be able to claim for a remedy.</p>
<p Align=left> </p>
<p Align=center> b. The regime of the action</p>
<p Align=justify> Before going any further, it is interesting to notice that
the rules governing the reception of the good as regard the &#171;obligation de
d&eacute;livrance conforme&Oacute; do not apply to latent defect<sup>148</sup>.
This seems in fact logical as latent defect are<u> hidden</u> and as only
the<u> apparent</u> non-conformity of the good is covered by its reception.</p>
<p Align=left> If the time limit to lodge a claim is long enough (i) the
functioning of the remedies available makes it hard to use for consumers
(ii).</p>
<p Align=center> i. The period during which a claim can be lodged</p>
<p Align=left> Prior to the Ordinance of 2005, buyers could only complain
within a brief period (&Ograve;bref d&eacute;lai&Oacute;) discovery good 149</p>
<p Align=left> after the of a defect affecting the . Such brief period was</p>
<p Align=justify> rather unclear<sup>150</sup> and led to several disputes in
cases law until it was recently abandoned and replaced by a period of two
years<sup>151</sup>. This period is to be distinguished from the the of 1999
152</p>
<p Align=left> one provided for in Directive . Indeed, albeit they</p>
<p Align=justify> both provide for a two years length of time during which
buyers are entitled to lodge a claim, the period begins at the discovery of the
defect for buyers complaining for a latent defect whereas it begins right at
the delivery of the good for consumers complaining for non-conformity on the
ground of the ordinance of 2005. Thus, the period of two years stated in the
Ordinance is mechanically shorter. This difference is paradoxical since on this
point, it can be more interesting for a consumer to rely on the regime of
latent defect, as a professional buyer, than on the specific regime especially
designed for consumers.</p>
<p Align=left> </p>
<p Align=justify> In addition, the period provided for in the Ordinance is
close since it begins at the delivery of the good. Conversely, the period
stated for latent defect is open for it only begins at the detection of the
defect, providing that such detection can be made years after the delivery of
the good. As a matter of fact, judges are ready to accept that a latent defect
can be discovered more than 200 years after the creation of the
good<sup>153</sup>. This case shows that the regime of latent defects does not
provide any security to sellers who can receive claims many years after the
delivery of the good. For this reason, such open period can be questioned as it
leads to legal uncertainty for sellers. Moreover, the open period is also
problematic since it relies on the good faith of buyers who can make up the
moment of discovery of the defect to avoid the two years time limit.</p>
<p Align=justify> However, the advantages of an open period appear to surpass
its drawbacks. First of all, it can be noted that in practice, the more buyers
will wait before they complain and the more it will be difficult for them to
prove that the defect existed prior to the purchase of the good and that it
does not result from the normal wear and tear resulting from its utilisation.
In addition, the life span of numerous goods is much longer than two years so
an open period is adjusted to each kind of good. Conversely, a closed period of
two years is too short for goods such as car or washing machine which are
expected to last longer than two years and for which a latent defect can be
discovered after such length of time. Furthermore, it would be unfair to deny
any right to complain to buyers who discover a defect after two years following
the delivery since they would be in a situation where they had lost a right
<em>before</em> knowing they had it<sup>154</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left> </p>
<p Align=justify> In any case, as for non-conformity, the open period for
latent defect is not indefinite since the statute of limitation stated in
article 2232 of the Civil Code applies. Accordingly, buyers have a maximum of
twenty years to complain from the moment they purchased the good regardless of
the moment they detected the defect.</p>
<p Align=center> ii. The remedies</p>
<p Align=center> First of all, it is worth noting that the obligation lying on
sellers to provide a good free<br>of defect is an obligation of result
(obligation to achieve a certain result). Thus, the</p>
<p Align=left> 155</p>
<p Align=left> fact that sellers are unaware of the flaw affecting the good or
did not commit any fault<sup>156</sup> is immaterial and will not stop buyers
from obtaining a remedy.</p>
<p Align=center> Pursuant to article 1644 of the Civil Code<sup>157</sup>,
buyers who purchased a good with a<br>latent defect have the choice between two
remedies: resolution of the contract (&aacute;)<br>and price reduction
(&acirc;). The choice given to buyers between these two remedies is</p>
<p Align=left> 158</p>
<p Align=justify> absolutely free, which is really favourable for buyers . In
addition, buyers can also claim for reparation or replacement of the product
affected by a latent defect (&atilde;). Finally, in any case, buyers are
entitled to damages for any loss they have suffered as a result of the
non-conformity of the good (&auml;).</p>
<p Align=center> &aacute;. The resolution of the contract (&#171;action
r&eacute;dhibitoire&#187;)</p>
<p Align=center> Resolution is the most used remedy<sup>159</sup> and leads to
the termination of the contract<br>with retroactive effects. Generally
speaking, the effects of the resolution for latent</p>
<p Align=left> </p>
<p Align=justify> defect are the same as those applicable for the resolution
for non-conforming goods<sup>160</sup>: the return of the good to sellers and a
full refund for buyers. The slight differences in terms of regime will anyway
be highlighted.</p>
<p Align=center> Resolution provides buyers with a really strong bargaining
power since they can still</p>
<p Align=right> 161</p>
<p Align=center> terminate the contract even after a rep air has been carried
out if it failed . In<br>addition, they can <em>impose </em>resolution to
sellers even if they have first asked for price</p>
<p Align=left> 162</p>
<p Align=justify> reduction or for the replacement of the good . However,
contrary to the &#171;garantie des vices cach&eacute;s &#187;, to obtain the
refund, the buyers need to return themselves the good to the
sellers<sup>163</sup>. In addition, if sellers cannot claim for an indemnity on
the ground that the buyers used the good 164 , they can however, contrary to
the solution applicable for non -conformity, ask for a compensation for the
depreciation of the good<sup>165</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify> At first sight, it seems that the rules are rather harsh for
sellers since as soon as a latent defect is detected, they can lose the
contract and all the benefits pertaining to it. On the other hand, however, as
highlighted as regard non-conformity, buyers still have to ask a judge to order
the resolution. Thus, here again, such rule is rather difficult to put in
practice by consumers when the good purchased is not of great value.</p>
<p Align=center> &acirc;. Price reduction (&#171;r&eacute;faction&#187; or
<em>action quanti minoris</em>)</p>
<p Align=center> Instead of resolution, buyers can also ask for price
reduction. Accordingly, they will<br>obtain a sum of money corresponding to the
difference between the price paid for the</p>
<p Align=left> </p>
<p Align=justify> good and its actual value when taking into account the
defect<sup>166</sup>. It is important to note that technically, the fraction of
price given back to buyers has to be decided by experts<sup>167</sup>. Thus,
consumers confronted to a latent defect need to go to Court to obtain a price
reduction. Such process is heavy and is likely to discourage most of them from
so doing, unless the good concerned is of great value.</p>
<p Align=center> <strong>y</strong>. Repair or replacement of the good</p>
<p Align=justify> Buyers can also choose specific performance and can thus ask
sellers for a repair or the replacement of the good<sup>168</sup> . Generally
speaking, these remedies are preferred by sellers who then do not lose all
benefits arising from the contract. As regard replacement, it seems that such
remedy can be asked by the buyers when the good purchased is not individualised
and can be replaced by another good which is exactly the same as the former
one. As a example, a new car is a good w hich is not individualised and can be
replaced whereas an original 1956 Thunderbird purchased in 2010 is unique and
could not be replaced if it proves itself to be defective. Theoretically,
repair and replacement have to be ordered by a judge.</p>
<p Align=justify> However, in practice, buyers can threaten sellers of
resolution in order to obtain the replacement of the good or its
reparation<sup>169</sup>. This depends however upon the respective bargaining
power of the parties. As far as consumers are concerned, this bargaining power
is often small and they can experience difficulties in the obtaining of this
kind of remedy.</p>
<p Align=left> </p>
<p Align=center> &auml;. Damages</p>
<p Align=center> Regardless of any other remedy chosen, buyers can also claim
for damages for the<br>losses they suffered<sup>170</sup>. Damages can be
obtained for the compensation of a wide</p>
<p Align=right> 171</p>
<p Align=justify> variety of prejudices corresponding to the costs which arose
from the sale , the unavailability of the good<sup>172</sup> or, more broadly,
to all the costs caused by the defect itself<sup>173</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify> The obtaining of damages is subject to the proof of the
defect, the prejudice it caused and the casual link between them both. No
further conditions are required to obtain compensation for the costs which
arose from the <u> conclusion of the contract<sup>174</sup>.</u></p>
<p Align=justify> However, for the obtaining of any other damages, the bad
faith of the sellers has to be proved. In fact, sellers are in bad faith if
they knew that the good sold contained a latent defect<sup>175</sup>. At first
sight, it seems that this proof is very difficult to show. However, all
professional sellers are deemed to be aware of all defects affecting the goods
they sell, providing that such presumption is conclusive unless the buyer is
also a professional from the same specialty<sup>176</sup>. Thus, at least when
contracting with consumers, professional sellers are always considered as being
in bad faith and are thus always liable for all damages resulting from the
latent defect affecting the good. This is very protective of consumer
interests.</p>
<p Align=left>  <strong>3. The Directive's implementation in France</strong></p>
<p Align=left> Directive without deficiencies 177</p>
<p Align=left> The has been transposed in French Law by the</p>
<p Align=justify> Ordinance of 2005 and can be found in the Consumer Code from
article L. 211 -1 to L. 211-18<sup>178</sup>. As the Directive's content has
already been analysed, we will only look at the specificities of the French
measure of transposition and what is new compared to the existing legal
framework in France.</p>
<p Align=justify> First of all, it is worth noting that the scope of
application of the Ordinance is much narrower than the one of latent defect and
the &#171;garantie de conformity&#187;. Indeed, the Ordinance only applies to
contracts concluded between consumers and professionals<sup>179</sup> and which
concern tangible movable items<sup>180</sup>. However, consumers are free to
choose any regime they want and do not have to rely on the Ordinance of
2005<sup>181</sup>. On the one hand, this situation is a good thing as all
three regimes are different and, depending on the problems they encounter,
consumers will be best protected by a different set of rule<sup>182</sup>. On
the other hand, this situation can be criticised as leading to confusions for
consumers, especially the less educated one<sup>183</sup>, who are rather
unlikely to understand easily their rights.</p>
<p Align=left> The two main important points of the Ordinance of 2005 concern
the notion of non conformity (a) and its regime (b).</p>
<p Align=left>  a. The notion of non-conformity</p>
<p Align=justify> The notion of non-conformity itself is at the core of the
transposition of the Directive<sup>184</sup>. Indeed, as it is a monist
conception which is thus new compared to the existing framework in France, its
transposition was carried out very carefully. To make it simple, according to
the new concept of conformity, goods have to be as specified in the contract
agreed between the consumer and the seller (equivalent to the &Ograve;garantie
de conformity&Oacute;) and must also be able to work properly (equivalent to
the latent defect).</p>
<p Align=justify> It is worth noting that France transposed the notion of
non-conformity differently from the way it is provided for in the Directive.
Indeed, the Directive provides for a <em>presumption</em> of conformity when
some criterions are fulfilled whereas France only provides for a general about
fitness 185</p>
<p Align=left> requirement goods' . Moreover, the French</p>
<p Align=justify> transposition of the notion of non-conformity is dual, but
not as the provisions of the Civil Code<sup>186</sup>. Indeed, it distinguishes
between contracts which are negotiated and those which can only be agreed as
such and cannot be negotiated, the so-called adhesion contracts<sup>187</sup>.
Accordingly, to be conforming, a good must:</p>
<p Align=justify>&#183;  Correspond to the use usually made for this kind of
good and, if applicable, to the description and the sample given by the seller
and to the public statement made by the seller or the producer
<sup>188</sup>;<u> or</u></p>
<p Align=justify>&#183;  Have the characteristics specifically agreed by the
parties or correspond to the use the consumer is willing to make of the good as
long as such use has been known and agreed by the seller<sup>189</sup>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p Align=justify>Such distinction is rather well-thought and intellectually
relevant as there is, in practice, a clear distinction between adhesion
contracts and contracts which can be negotiated and for which the consumer can
ask for specific requirements. Moreover, it can be noted that this distinction
is not completely different from the distinction between latent defect and the
&#171;garantie de conformit&eacute;&#187; in the Civil Code. Indeed, whereas
the part referring to adhesion contracts<sup>190</sup> broadly corresponds to
the &#171;garantie de conformit&eacute;&#187;, the part about negotiated
contracts<sup>191</sup> corresponds in fact to the concept of latent
defect<sup>192</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left>In addition, as with latent defect and in accordance with the
Directive, the nonconformity good must be ignored by the consumer 193</p>
<p Align=left>of the and cannot take its origin</p>
<p Align=left>in the materials himself 194</p>
<p Align=left>the consumer provided . Likewise, the seller cannot be held</p>
<p Align=justify>liable on the basis of public statements he was not and could
not reasonably be aware of<sup>195</sup> although, conversely to the directive,
no reference is made to the correction of the public statements and the fact
that the consumer might not have been influenced by them<sup>196</sup>. This
difference is thus more protective of consumers who are less likely to face a
denial of their right from sellers claiming the irrelevance of such public
statement.</p>
<p Align=justify>Furthermore, it can be noted that, as in the Directive, France
did not assimilate the delivery of the wrong quantity of goods to
non-conformity. This solution was nonetheless conceivable and has in fact been
carried out by Germany<sup>197</sup>.</p>
<p Align=center>The only difficulty as regard the notion of non-conformity and
its inclusion in the<br>French legal system is that nothing is specified as
regard the importance of the</p>
<p Align=left>198</p>
<p Align=justify>reception of the good . Indeed, as already highlighted as
regard the &#171;garantie de conformit&eacute;&#187;, when being delivered, it
is important that the consumer expresses reservation if the good seems to be
non-conforming, or even refuses it. Otherwise, he will not be entitled to claim
for any apparent non-conformity. As nothing is specified, one can wonder
whether such obligation is also applicable for consumers under the new
regime<sup>199</sup>. This is a fairly important question as regard the
consequences at stake: the lost of all rights to claim remedy for the consumer.
Regrettably, no case law has clarified this point yet and consumers are thus
advised to make all reservations as regard possible non-conformity of the good
when it is delivered to them.</p>
<p Align=left>b. The regime of non-conformity</p>
<p Align=justify>Whereas the time limit during which consumers are entitled to
complain is not so much protective and not free of defect (i), the presumption
of anteriority is a new and very welcome provision in French law (ii) and the
functioning of the remedial scheme, although providing for a hierarchy, appears
to be rightly designed for consumers (iii).</p>
<p Align=center>i. The period during which a claim can be lodged</p>
<p Align=center>The Directive of 1999 provides for two distinct length of time
during which consumers<br>can claim for non-conformity, one of two years from
the delivery of the good and<br>another one of two months from the moment when
the consumer detected the non-</p>
<p Align=justify>conformity<sup>200</sup>. However, providing that the
Directive is of minimal harmonisation, France decided to transpose only the
first period. Accordingly, consumers confronted to a non-conforming good have
two years from the delivery to complain<sup>201</sup>.</p>
<p Align=center>The fact that the two months period has not been transposed in
French law is<br>satisfactory for consumers who then enjoy a longer period to
complain. However, the</p>
<p Align=left>202</p>
<p Align=justify>two years period duly implemented is rather short , especially
for goods which are expected to last much longer such as televisions or
bicycles for instance. Moreover, this two years period begins right at</p>
<p Align=justify>the delivery of the good and not, as for latent defect, when
the defect is detected. As a consequence, consumers discovering a defect three
years after the delivery of the good will then not be allowed to lodge a claim.
This is highly questionable as they will have lost their right before even
knowing they had it.</p>
<p Align=justify>Finally, it can be noted that no clue is given as regard the
applicability of the two years time limit to the claim for damages, in
particular when no other remedy is asked by the consumer<sup>203</sup>. Indeed,
damages are not provided for by the Directive and their allocation is thus
governed by national laws. This is an important question as if the time limit
does not apply consumers who are late to claim for other remedies will be
willing to obtain their compensation on this other ground. As such, this legal
uncertainty is questionable.</p>
<p Align=center>ii. The presumption of anteriority</p>
<p Align=left>204</p>
<p Align=justify>The non -conformity of the good must exist prior to its
delivery . In conformity with the Directive, all defects arising within six
months following the delivery of the good are deemed to be
anterior<sup>205</sup> . This presumption can be fought if the seller can prove
that the presumption is not compatible with the nature of the good or with the
non- confo rm ity<sup>206</sup>. Indeed, as an example, a tomato is obviously
not supposed to last six month.</p>
<p Align=justify>Such presumption is a great step forward for consumers since
it did not exist in French law prior to the Ordinance of 2005. Albeit judges
were sometimes lenient and easily ready to regard any defect appearing soon
after the delivery of the good as being anterior to the delivery<sup>207</sup>,
as a matter of fact, the proof lying on consumers was rather burdensome.</p>
<p Align=center>iii. The remedies</p>
<p Align=justify>The Directive of 1999 provides for four remedies in case of
non-conformity and, most importantly, provides for a hierarchy as regard the
choice between these remedies. The transposition operated by the Ordinance is
conformed to the Directive's provision<sup>208</sup>. As these provisions have
already been detailed (<em>A. The Directive of 1999 on certain aspect of goods
and associated guarantees</em>), they will not be recalled here. However, the
principle of a hierarchy is questionable as it lowers consumers' choice and,
thus, their bargaining power. As a matter of fact, this hierarchy is not
protecti ve of consumers' interest since terminating the contract or</p>
<p Align=left>obtaining a price reduction are legitimate claims which should
not be granted only as second tiers remedies.</p>
<p Align=justify>In accordance with the Directive, resolution is not available
for a minor nonconformity and the remedies must be carried out free of charge
for consumers. However, conversely to the Directive, the Ordinance specifically
allows consumers to claim for damages<sup>209</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>As compared to the two-hundred-years old regimes set in the
Civil Code, the new one provided for by the Ordinance in accordance with the
Directive does not refer to any judge's help. This means that in daily
transactions, consumers can claim for remedies directly to the sellers and need
not to give any formal notice or to ask a judge to provide the
remedy<sup>210</sup>. This is also true for the resolution of the contract
which can be, though as a second tier of remedy, decided by consumers on their
owns. Likewise, it is self-evident that the first tier of remedy provided,
replacement or reparation, has to be asked directly to the seller. As a matter
of fact, it is only if the sellers refuse to carry out any remedy that
consumers will face a dilemma: does the good&Otilde;s value worth the trouble
and the money to go to court? As such, assessed only on thi s highly practical
ground, the new regime is much handier, and thus much more protective of
consumers.</p>
<p Align=left><strong>C. The current regime in the UK - A unified and efficient
regime</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The current regulatory framework applicable in the UK is based
on the Sale of Goods Act 1979 as amended by the Sale and Supply of Goods Act
1994 (the SoGA) and by the Sales and Supply of Goods to Consumer Regulations
2002 (referred to as the Regulations)<sup>211</sup> which transposed the
Directive of 1999. Thus, the regime applicable to all buyers and the one
applicable only to consumers as resulting from the Directive of 1999 are both
laid down in the same Statute. As a result, consumers benefit from the general
provisions laid down for all contract of sales as well as from the provisions
especially designed for consumers sales. As the regime especially designed for
consumers fits naturally in the general framework of contract sales
law<sup>212</sup>, the law applicable to consumers is particularly clear. This
is especially true in comparison to the French regime. Moreover, it is worth
noting that oddly enough, the French regime has been greatly construed by
judges and do not rely as much on writing rules than the English system which
is plainly established on the SoGA.</p>
<p Align=justify>In addition, the UK's notion of non-conforming good is unique
and encompasses both the French notion of latent defect and the
&Ograve;garantie de conformit&eacute;&Oacute;. As such, both the complexity and
the confusion pertaining to the French legal system on this matter are avoided.
Moreover, more than being clear, the regime set in the SoGA is particularly
protective of buyers as it offers them remedies, and in particular the right of
rejection, which use is simple and which can be exercised without any judge's
help. As such, buyers, and in particular consumers, are granted with a strong
bargaining power and are thus well-protected.</p>
<p Align=justify>Before going any further, it is important to keep in mind that
within the UK, the English, the Welsh and the Northern Ireland law can
sometimes be different from the Scottish law<sup>213</sup>. Thu s, all relevant
differences will be highlighted throughout our analysis.</p>
<p Align=justify>Except on a few issues adapted to consumers, the notion of
non-conforming good is a unique and general one applicable to all buyers (1).
Conversely, the remedial scheme is dual: one laid down for all contract of
sales and available for all buyers without restriction and another one
especially drafted for consumers (2).</p>
<p Align=left><strong>1. The notion of non-conforming goods</strong></p>
<p Align=left>Non-conforming goods will also be referred to as faulty goods.
Goods do not conform</p>
<p Align=right>214</p>
<p Align=justify>when there are in breach of an express or an implied term of
the contract of sales . The first hypothesis is easily understandable: a seller
who expressly states that the mobile phone sold can go on the internet whereas
in fact it cannot is in breach of an express term of the contract. As a
consequence, the buyer is entitled to all contractual remedies available for
breach of contract. Conversely, the concept of &#171;implied term&#187;,
detailed in sections 13, 14 and 15 of the SoGA, is not self-evident from a
continental point of view. Yet, it is at the core of buyers' protection in
contract of sales and is one of the most used provisions of the
SoGA<sup>215</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left>The notion of &#171;implied term&#187; is a system whereby some
goods' characteristics, being regarded as of great significance, are considered
as being included in all contracts of</p>
<p Align=justify>sales exactly as if the parties have decided to include it
themselves<sup>216</sup>. As the parties have never specifically agreed on this
point, this system of implied terms is a &#171;legal fiction&#187;.</p>
<p Align=justify>If a good does not comply with one of the implied
characteristics detailed in the SoGA, the seller is in breach of this term,
which is to say in breach of contract. In English law, there are two kinds of
breaches of contract: the breach of warranty, which is regarded as a minor
breach, and the breach of conditions which is regarded as an important
breach<sup>217</sup>. Only the latter breach gives without contest a right to
the party who suffered it to terminate the contract<sup>218</sup> . However, as
far as consumers are concerned, this distinction is most of the time
irrelevant. Indeed, the SoGA provides that as regard consumers' sales, minor
defects or minor non-compliance are <u>always </u>treated as breaches of
conditions<sup>219</sup> . As a result, providing that sellers cannot exclude
any implied term i n a consumer contract<sup>220</sup>, consumers confronted to
a nonconforming good are entitled, regardless of the seriousness of the defect,
to all contractual remedies, including the termination of the contract.</p>
<p Align=center>Furthermore, sellers cannot defend themselves by arguing that
they have done all</p>
<p Align=left>221</p>
<p Align=left>they could to ensure that the good was of quality</p>
<p Align=left>satisfactory . Such provision is</p>
<p Align=justify>equivalent to the French notion of obligation of result
whereby a party has to achieve a certain result and does not have any way of
defense if such result is not reached. This provision is thus protective of
buyers' interests as there is no debate as regard the existence of a fault
attributable to the seller.</p>
<p Align=left>The implied terms specifically stated in Sections 13, 14 and 15
of the SoGA are only</p>
<p Align=left>222</p>
<p Align=center>the basic one and the list provided is thus not comprehensive .
As a result, a buyer<br>can always argue that a particular trade or local
custom exists and provides for</p>
<p Align=left>223</p>
<p Align=center>another implied term not listed in the SoGA . Likewise, buyers
can also claim that a</p>
<p Align=right>224</p>
<p Align=justify>particul ar term, though not listed, is necessary to give to
the contract its efficacy . As an example, in <em>Mash and Murrell v Joseph I
Emmanuel</em>, the goods' ability to withstand the journey which had to be done
was considered as an implied term of the contact. Thus, as the potatoes did not
withstand the journey, they were regarded as non-conforming<sup>225</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>The system of implied terms is rather inventive. Indeed, as it
has a contractual basis, it gives the right to consumers, in any case, to
escape from a contract which provided them with a faulty good. Thus, consumers
are granted with a strong bargaining power. As a consequence, consumers' claims
for a repair or a replacement for instance are likely to be agreed by sellers
who are threatened by the fact that consumers might impose the termination of
the contract. However, sellers can always choose to ignore consumers' claim.
Consumers would then have to go to court to obtain the refund. Nonetheless,
this system seems better than the French one laid down in the Civil Code
whereby most of the times, consumers' claims for a remedy <u>must</u> be
commanded by a judge.</p>
<p Align=justify>Three main matters are of significance as regard the goods'
conformity to the implied terms of a contract. More precisely, to comply with
the implied terms stated in the SoGA, a (ii) 227</p>
<p Align=left>good must be as described (i) <sup>226</sup>, must be of &#171;
satisfactory quality&#187; and</p>
<p Align=left>must fit with its purpose (iii)<sup>228</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left>i. The goods must comply with their description or with the
sample</p>
<p Align=justify>Section 13 of the SoGA provides that in sales by description,
there is an implied term that the goods sold will correspond to their
description. Albeit there has been many debates surrounding the notion of
description&#187; 229</p>
<p Align=left>&#171;sales by , it is nowadays assumed</p>
<p Align=center>that every good which contains words of description, on their
packaging for instance,<br>are sales by description<sup>230</sup>. Thus, it can
be said that virtually all sales are concerned<br>with the provisions laid down
in Section 13. However, that does not mean that all</p>
<p Align=right>231</p>
<p Align=left>words written in relation to a good are treated as part of this
good's description . Indeed, what is important good 232</p>
<p Align=left>is whether the words are used to describe the and</p>
<p Align=left>whether the buyer relied on the description before purchasing the
good<sup>233</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>Where a contract of sale is regarded as a sale by description,
judges have to decide whether a given good complies with the description
attached to it. As a matter of fact, judges appear to be largely in favour of
buyers and to regard any slight discrepancy between a good's description and
its real characteristics as being a breach of the implied term that the good
must conform to its description. As an example, cans were regarded as being
non-conforming to their description where, though the right number was
delivered and their packaging was irrelevant for the buyer, they were packed in
boxes of 24 instead of boxes of 30<sup>234</sup>. As a result, Section 13 of
the SoGA appears to give buyers an efficient ground on which they can rely when
they are confronted to a good which is not as described by the seller.</p>
<p Align=justify>In addition, if the sale is a sale by sample, the SoGA
specifically provides that the good must be free of any defect which is not
apparent on a reasonable examination of the sample<sup>235</sup> . One the one
hand, this means that buyers cannot complain for a defect which was apparent on
the sample. However, on the other hand, it is easy for buyers to show that the
good purchased does not comply with the sample presented and that it does not
conform. The significance of this provision must not be underestimated as some
kind of sales are usually made by sample, such as the sale of paving for
instance.</p>
<p Align=left>ii. The goods must be of &Ograve;satisfactory quality&#187;</p>
<p Align=justify>Under the Sale of Good Act 1893, any good which was not of
&#171;merchantable quality&#187; was regarded as faulty<sup>236</sup>. However,
the <em>Sale and Supply of Goods Report</em> drafted by the Law in 1987 237</p>
<p Align=left>Commission and the</p>
<p Align=left>Scottish Law Commission criticised such</p>
<p Align=justify>condition as being unclear for both buyers and
sellers<sup>238</sup> and suggested instead that goods should be of
&#171;acceptable quality&#187;. This report led to the amendment of the SoGA
1979 by the Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994 which provides that goods must be
of &#171;satisfactory quality&#187;<sup>239</sup> .</p>
<p Align=justify>Section 14 of the SoGA details all the characteristics which
make a good of satisfactory quality. Accordingly, goods are considered as being
of satisfactory quality if &#171;<em>they meet the standard that a reasonable
person would regard as satisfactory, taking account of any description of the
goods, the price (if relevant) and all other relevant
circumstances</em>&Oacute;<sup>240</sup>. More precisely, the terms provided by
the SoGA includes the goods' state and condition, their fitness for the
purposes such kind of goods are</p>
<p Align=right>usually used, their appearance and finish, their freedom from
minor defects, their</p>
<p Align=left>241</p>
<p Align=justify>safety and their durability . As already highlighted, all
elements which make a good of satisfactory quality are described in the SoGA as
being &#171;implied terms&#187; in all contracts of sales<sup>242</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left>In practice, the assessment as to whether a good</p>
<p Align=justify>is of satisfactory quality or not can be very difficult to
carry out and depends upon numerous factors such as the good itself and the
circumstances of the sales. Indeed, as an example, the good's age and</p>
<p Align=left>243</p>
<p Align=center>price is of great significance since a cheap or an old good is
not expected to reach</p>
<p Align=right>244</p>
<p Align=justify>a level of quality as high and to perform as well as an
expensive or a n ew one . Section 14(2A) provides specifically that the good's
price is taken into consideration as being part of the &#171; <em>other
relevant circumstances</em>&#187;. No specific reference is made to the age of
the good but, in fact, judges take this element into account on the same basis,
which is to say as being part of the &#171;<em>other relevant
circumstances</em>&#187;.</p>
<p Align=justify>Moreover, it is worth noting that sellers are protected as
regard all defects and specific points they have shown to the buyers before the
purchase. Indeed, such matters are not considered as implied terms and
consumers cannot complain about them<sup>245</sup>. Likewise, if an examination
is done prior to the conclusion of the contract, defects which are apparent on
a reasonable examination of the good or which are ought to be revealed by such
examination are not regarded as implied terms either<sup>246</sup>. However,
buyers are not required to carry out such examination, which is a good point .
In addition, it must be noted buyers cannot claim for remedies in case of fair
wear and tear or if they misused the good<sup>247</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>In addition, when the buyer is a <u>consumer,</u> the
Regulation, in accordance with the Directive it has transposed, adds another
implied term. Indeed, Section 14(2D) of the SoGA includes in the &#171;
<em>other relevant circumstances</em>&#187; the public statements on the good
made by the seller or the producer, especially those made in advertisings or on
the labeling. However, sellers can defend themselves by showing that they were
not aware and could not reasonably be aware of this public statement, that such
statement has been withdrawn or corrected in public or if they prove that the
consumer could not have been influenced by the statement<sup>248</sup>. In such
cases, sellers will not be regarded as being in breach of contract.</p>
<p Align=left>iii. The goods must fit for their purpose</p>
<p Align=justify>Section 14(3) of the SoGA specifically provides that when
buyers makes known to sellers that they intent to use of good for a particular
purpose which is different from the normal use such kind of goods are usually
purchased, the good must fit for this specific purpose<sup>249</sup>. Here
again, what is important is the description of the good, an issue already dealt
with under Sections 13 (sales by description), 14(2A) and 14(2D) of the SoGA.
However, the specificity of this provision is that it allows more flexibility
for buyers. Indeed, they can buy a good for a specific use which requires
qualities not included in the good's description without loosing the protection
they are granted with. However, the particular use the good will be used for
must be drawn to the sellers' attention<sup>250</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left>If, somehow, the goods are non-conforming, the sellers are in
breach of contract and, subsequently, consumers can claim for remedies.</p>
<p Align=left><strong>2. The remedies</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>In addition to the remedies stated for all buyers (a), Section
48 of the SoGA also provides for specific remedies especially designed for
consumers by the Regulations (b).</p>
<p Align=left>a. The traditional remedies in the UK</p>
<p Align=justify>As highlighted above, a non-conforming good is a good which
does not fit with the implied terms stated in the SoGA or any other relevant
terms as those agreed by the parties or those coming from customs. Sellers
delivering faulty goods are in breach of contract and buyers are thus entitled
to remedies. These remedies can be the termination of the contract and the
rejection of the goods (i), the withholding of performance (ii), specific
performance (iii) and damages (iv)<sup>251</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left>i. The termination of the contract and the right of rejection</p>
<p Align=justify>The termination of the contract and the right of rejection are
two different figures (&aacute;) but as far as consumers are concerned, the
right of rejection is emblematic and the focus must then be put on it
(&acirc;).</p>
<p Align=center>&aacute;. An overview on the termination of the contract</p>
<p Align=center>First of all, when consumers are entitled to terminate the
contract that does not mean<br>they <em>must </em>do so. Indeed, in English
law, the termination of the contract is seen as a<br>matter of
&#171;election&#187; and the party who suffered the breach can choose to
terminate</p>
<p Align=right>252</p>
<p Align=center>the contract or to continue its performance (affirmation of the
contract) . No</p>
<p Align=left>particular from choice 253</p>
<p Align=left>is required to make the and the only thing which matters is</p>
<p Align=left>&#187;254</p>
<p Align=justify>that there must be &#171; <em>unequivocal words or conduct
</em>. Thus, consumers should be aware that their choice can be, for instance,
inferred from the mere fact that the good is rej ected <sup>255</sup>. This
shows the ambiguous relationship existing between the right of rejection and
the right to terminate the contract, especially in contracts of sales.</p>
<p Align=justify>The rejection of the good is a way for the aggrieved party to
express his choice to terminate the contract. However, in practice, the
rejection of the good does not necessarily lead to the termination of the
contract. As an example, say a seller has a period of time of one week to
perform a contract which consists in the delivery of a television. If he
delivers it on Day 2 but it appears to be non-conforming, then the buyer can
reject the good but wait for another delivery to be made on time. Thus, if a
conforming good is delivered on Day 5, the buyer will have exercised his right
of rejection without terminating the contract. As regard consumers, we have
seen that</p>
<p Align=right>256</p>
<p Align=left>any non -conformity, even slight, gives them the right to
terminate contract</p>
<p Align=justify>the . However, this does not force them to do so and they can
instead wait for a conforming delivery to be done.</p>
<p Align=justify>On a more intellectual ground, the termination of the contract
is the proper name of the remedy consumers are entitled to when they suffer a
breach of contract. Thus, as far as they are concerned, talking about the right
of rejection <u>as a remedy</u> is an abuse of language as it is only a
<em>modality </em>of exercise of the right to terminate the contract.</p>
<p Align=justify>It shall be noted that the termination of the contract is not
the equivalent to the French resolution for latent defect or &#171;garantie de
conformit&eacute;&Oacute;. Indeed, as r egard resolution it is assumed that the
co ntract has never existed and its destruction has thus retroactive effects.
Conversely, the UK's notion of termination does not entail any retroactivity
and the contract simply goes to an end<sup>257</sup>. Thus, in practice,
consumers can claim damages on a contractual ground.</p>
<p Align=justify>As consumers' most common and known way to terminate the
contract is by rejecting the good, we will especially focus on it. We will
nonetheless keep in mind that it remains a mere <em>modality </em>of the
termination of the contract.</p>
<p Align=center>&acirc;. A focus on the right of rejection</p>
<p Align=right>258</p>
<p Align=justify>The regime pertaining to the right of rejection has been
created by cases law and was first codified in the Sale of Goods Act 1893
though it was not defined there and has never been defined in any statute
since. In practice, the right of rejection is very popular amongst consumers as
they do not have to litigate but only to tell the sellers that they reject the
good. It is thus to sellers to decide whether it is worthwhile to go to court
or not. As such, the right of rejection is seen as one of the most
emblematic</p>
<p Align=justify>provision protecting consumers in the UK. Before detailing
further its use for consumers, it is worth noting that in addition to
non-conforming goods, those delivered late 260</p>
<p Align=left>in wrong quantity <sup>259</sup> or delivered can be rejected by
consumers. This</p>
<p Align=justify>precision is important since late delivery of goods is a
matter of great significance in consumers' sales. Allowing them to take an
efficient action in this case is thus a good way to protect them.</p>
<p Align=justify>The most problematic provisions as regard the right of
rejection concern the examination of the goods, their acceptance and the length
of the reasonable period. The exercise of the right of rejection will also be
further detailed.</p>
<p Align=left> The examination of the good</p>
<p Align=center>The first point which was discussed in early cases law was the
existence of an<br>obligation to inspect the goods prior to the purchase.
Albeit such inspection was</p>
<p Align=left>261262</p>
<p Align=justify>required until the mid -twentieth century , it was later
abandoned and buyers were then given the right to inspect the good
<em>after</em> the property passed and to reject it in case of
non-conformity<sup>263</sup>. This step forward was established in law with the
1994 amendment of the SoGA<sup>264</sup> and is to be approved. Indeed, it does
not seem reasonable to me to require from buyers, especially when they are
consumers, to examine all goods before they acquire them. It seems better to
give them some time after the purchase to do so.</p>
<p Align=left> The acceptance of the good</p>
<p Align=left>The right of rejection is granted to consumers confronted to
faulty goods as long as they do not ed good 265</p>
<p Align=left>have accept the . Indeed, pursuant to Section 11(4) of the</p>
<p Align=justify>SoGA, the breach of contract is to be treated as a breach of
warranty if the buyer has accepted the good. As already highlighted, a breach
of warranty does not give buyers the right to terminate the contract. Thus, if
the good has been accepted, consumers cannot reject it.</p>
<p Align=left>Acceptance occurs when consumers:</p>
<p Align=left>&gt; Intimate to sellers that they have accepted the goods
<u>(intimation)<sup>266</sup>;</u></p>
<p Align=right>&gt; Use the good in a manner which is not consistent with the
seller' s</p>
<p Align=right>ownership of the goods <u>(inconsistent act,</u> providing that
consumers do not</p>
<p Align=left>act in such a manner by merely asking the seller for
repair<sup>267</sup>); &gt; Keep the good during a <u>reasonable
period<sup>268</sup></u></p>
<p Align=justify>The first two conditions leading to the acceptance of the good
are rather clear. Intimation does not lead to any difficulty as the consumer
positively expresses its acceptation of the good. Likewise, the use of the good
in an inconsistent manner is usually rather clear. What is in fact difficult to
assess is the acceptance inferred from the retaining of the good during a
reasonable period. Such issue is of great practical significance providing that
most of the times, acceptance is actually inferred from the</p>
<p Align=left>fact that consumers keep the good without complaining during a
reasonable period of time.</p>
<p Align=left> The reasonable period</p>
<p Align=center>What exactly amounts to a reasonable period of time is not
clearly stated and can<br>hardly be anticipated<sup>269</sup>. Indeed, little
cases laws are available to make this point</p>
<p Align=left>clearer<sup>270</sup> and some contradictory 271</p>
<p Align=left>of them are even . That is why the assessment of</p>
<p Align=left>272</p>
<p Align=left>the reasonable period is regarded as a matter fact</p>
<p Align=left>of . Thus, only general</p>
<p Align=left>observations can be drawn as regard the length of a reasonable
period and what is relevant for its calculation.</p>
<p Align=justify>First of all, consumers are not considered as having accepted
the good until they had the opportunity to examine them and to ascertain
whether it is of satisfactory quality<sup>273</sup>. However, providing that
such examination of the goods can take place after the purchase, in of period
274</p>
<p Align=left>it has consequences the length the reasonable . As</p>
<p Align=justify>such, the reasonable period cannot be less (but can be more)
than the time it takes to examine the goods purchased<sup>275</sup>. However,
it is important to keep in mind that the issue is whether the buyers had the
time to inspect the good, not whether they had the time to discover the defect.
Thus, as a matter of fact, the reasonable period often ends prior to the
detection of the defect if it is hidden.</p>
<p Align=left>276</p>
<p Align=left>More precisely, t he <em>Truk </em>case provides that a
reasonable period is the period</p>
<p Align=left>during which a rejection is reasonable as regard the buyer and
the seller' s situation.</p>
<p Align=left>As an example, in the <em>Berstein </em>case, the buyer was ill
and the judge took this fact into consideration in the assessment of the
reasonable period.</p>
<p Align=justify>Even though no exact anticipation as to the length of the
reasonable period can be made, it is important to note that <em>Consumer
Direct</em>, an online service giving advices on various issues concerning
consumers and funded by the government, reports that after two weeks, consumers
often have trouble to exercise their right to reject. However, the period
during which consumers can reject goods is probably longer than two
weeks<sup>277</sup>. This example shows clearly that uncertainty leads directly
to practical difficulties and to a decrease in consumers' rights.</p>
<p Align=justify>Admittedly, the right of rejection must be limited in time as
otherwise it would lead to legal uncertainty for sellers. However, this
limitation should be clearly stated, or, at least, more guidance should be
given. Indeed, if the right of rejection is <em>per se </em>very protective of
consumers, the fact that they can only exercise it during an undefined period
of time undermines their right. This uncertainty is thus highly questionable
and is to be regretted.</p>
<p Align=justify>In addition, it appears that the period of rejection is rather
short, probably not more than two or three months at most. Thus , when
confronted to latent a defect or latent non-conformity which is often
discovered months after the delivery of the good, consumers will not be able to
reject the good and will thus loose all the bargaining power this remedy offers
them. Thus, I believe that the period of time during which a good can be
rejected should be longer, six months for instance. This is the same period as
the one stated in the Directive and which concerns the presumption of</p>
<p Align=justify>anteriority of the non-conformity. Both provisions are, in
nature, very different. However, as they both put the consumer in a strong
position when confronted to a faulty good discovered shortly after the delivery
of the good, it makes sense to me to set a similar period for both of them.</p>
<p Align=left> The exercise of the right of rejection</p>
<p Align=center>Buyers exercise their right of rejection by intimating the
sellers of such rejection.<br>Thus, the strength of the right of rejection lies
on the fact that buyers can freely use it</p>
<p Align=left>278</p>
<p Align=justify>and need not to obtain its application by a judge . They only
need to do so if sellers refuse to refund the price paid<sup>279</sup>. More
than the content of the right itself, I believe that giving the power to
terminate the contract directly to buyers is <em>per se </em>the best way to
protect them. Moreover, unless otherwise agreed in the contract, buyers do not
have to return the goods to the sellers who have to take them
themselves<sup>280</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left>If faulty goods have already been accepted, no matter how, buyers
have lost their right to rejection but are still entitled to damages.</p>
<p Align=left>ii. The withholding of performance</p>
<p Align=center>Conversely to France, under the SoGA, the delivery of the good
and the payment of</p>
<p Align=left>281</p>
<p Align=justify>the price ar e concurrent conditions . This means that sellers
must be willing to transfer the possession of the good in exchange of its price
in the same time that buyers must be willing to pay the good in exchange of its
possession. Thus, under this scheme, in principle, no party can withhold
performance as this performance is a</p>
<p Align=left>of contract 282</p>
<p Align=left><u>condition</u> the . However, parties can provide that one of
them, the seller</p>
<p Align=justify>for instance, must first perform his obligation. In our
example, the buyer 's performance would then be <u>conditional</u> on the
seller having delivered the goods. Then, if the seller does not deliver the
goods, the buyer will be entitled to withhold performance<sup>283</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>However, this kind of agreement is rather uncommon in
consumers' sales and, in any case, consumers are generally required to pay
before or at the delivery of the good. Thus, they can rarely use this right.</p>
<p Align=left>iii. Specific performance: theory and practice</p>
<p Align=justify>Under the SoGA, buyers are entitled to specific performance
284 . However, it is to be noted that as compared to civil law countries, this
remedy is not automatic and rather hard to obtain from a judge. Indeed, courts
are generally reluctant to command specific performance since it is assumed
that when other remedies are more</p>
<p Align=left>285</p>
<p Align=justify>adequate, then they are ought to be com manded instead . Thus,
as far as ordinary goods are concerned, it is considered that it is more
adequate for buyers to obtain a refund and then to buy another good to another
seller than to obtain specific performance<sup>286</sup>. This remedy is then
difficult to obtain for consumers since they are often concerned with ordinary
goods.</p>
<p Align=center>However, in practice and even though there is no legal support
for such claims,<br>consumers can ask for repair or replacement, which are
forms of specific<br>performance. Indeed, when consumers are entitled to
terminate the contract and</p>
<p Align=justify>reject the good, they are also in a position which allows them
to ask, instead, for another remedy. In practice, it is likely that consumers
are only willing to have an efficient and conforming good and they need not to
terminate the contract if they can obtain satisfaction in another way. As such,
replacement or repair can then be satisfactory, or even price reduction if the
defect or the non-compliance is, for instance, minor. As a mater of fact,
unless such demands appear to be too expensive, sellers are usually happy to
accept repair, price reduction or replacement instead of rejection of the good
as thus, they do not lose all benefits arising from the contract.</p>
<p Align=left>iv. Damages</p>
<p Align=center>Consumers can claim damages, regardless of whether they have
rejected the goods</p>
<p Align=right>288289</p>
<p Align=justify>or not <sup>287</sup>, in case of non -delivery , late
delivery or delivery of faulty goods . The general requirements as to the
conditions which must be fulfilled to obtain damages, such as the condition of
foreseeability, will not be recalled. It is only important to keep in mind that
the scope of damages which can be recovered in the UK is narrower than in
France. Indeed, as an example, it is difficult for a party to obtain remedies
for the benefits he was expecting to earn if the contract had been performed
correctly. Likewise, consumers are unlikely to be able to obtain damages for
distress, inconvenience or disappointment<sup>290</sup>. If fewer losses can be
recovered in the UK as compared to France, as far as consumers are concerned, I
believe that the rules stated are satisfying. Indeed, consumers are not
concerned with businesses issues and with economic losses, for instance.</p>
<p Align=justify>In addition, in contract law, the prejudiced party is under a
general duty to mitigate his loss. This flows from the general principle that a
plaintiff can only recover what arises in the course of events 291</p>
<p Align=left>ordinary . As regard consumers, that means they</p>
<p Align=justify>have to report the non-conformity as soon as possible to
prevent the good from deteriorating further or to cause any other
damages<sup>292</sup>. Albeit this looks similar to the obligation to notify
the non -conformity within a period of two months stated in the Directive, it
is in fact different. Indeed, it only concerns the granting of damages and is
only relevant when the non-conformity can, by its nature, deteriorate further
the good or cause more damages. As such, this limitation seems reasonable.</p>
<p Align=center>As regard the assessment of damages, the SoGA provides
guidelines which are<br>helpful to determine what can be recovered by a buyer
confronted to a non-<br>conforming good . Accordingly, the measure of damages
is the &#171;<em>estimate loss directly</em></p>
<p Align=left>&#187;293</p>
<p Align=justify><em>and naturally resulting in the ordinary course of event
</em>, from the breach of contract. More precisely, in case of faulty good,
what can be recovered is the difference in terms of value between the faulty
the one 294</p>
<p Align=justify>product received and expected . In addition, consumers can
also ask for damages for any losses caused by the defective good itself, such
as the losses caused by a leaking dish washer for instance<sup>295</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left>b. The remedies especially designed for consumers</p>
<p Align=center>The Directive of 1999 has been transposed in English law by the
Sales and Supply of<br>Goods to Consumer Regulations 2002 (the Regulation)
which adds new rules as<br>regard consumers<sup>296</sup>. These new provisions
can be found in Section 48 of the SoGA</p>
<p Align=justify>and are perfectly included in the SoGA. Indeed, the new rules
apply if the goods delivered do not conform to the contract of sale and they
are non-conforming if they are in breach of the express or implied terms of the
contract as provided for under Section 13, 14 and 15 of the SoGA<sup>297</sup>.
Rules are therefore clear and the regime provided for all buyers is <em>per se
</em>comprehensive and easily understandable.</p>
<p Align=justify>Providing that the main features of the Directive have already
been analysed, we will only highlight the particularities pertaining to the
English transposition. First of all, it can be noted that the Directive is not
deeply shattered by the Regulation. Indeed, the government assured that no
lowering of the protection already granted to consumers</p>
<p Align=left>298</p>
<p Align=justify>would flow from the transposition of the Directive . Thus, as
an example, the Department of Trade and Industry, which was in charge of
implementing the rules coming from the Directive, did not enforce the Directive
rules about the consumers' obligation to notify any defect within two months of
its discovery. To sum up, the new rules do not undermine consumers existing
rights but only improve the one they already have .</p>
<p Align=center>One of the most important improvements for consumers is the
fact that they have the</p>
<p Align=right>299</p>
<p Align=justify>possibility to ask the sellers for the reparation or the
replacement of the good , providing that such repair or replacement must not be
carried out with significant inconvenience for the consumer and must be
performed at the seller's costs<sup>300</sup>. Thus, consumers can efficiently
rely on a legal ground to make such claim and not only on their bargaining
power, as it was the case before. Such possibility is of great importance since
most of the time, what consumers want is a good which works properly and are
thus not necessarily willing to reject it.</p>
<p Align=left>As provided for in the Directive, the seller can refuse to access
to the consumer's claim if replacement is disproportionate 301</p>
<p Align=left>the repair the</p>
<p Align=left>or impossible or and must</p>
<p Align=justify>then rescind the contract or reduce the price of the good.
However, as compared to the Directive, no hierarchy of remedy is provided. As a
result, consumers can directly ask for rescission or price reduction without
asking first for repair or replacement.</p>
<p Align=justify>Finally, in accordance with the Directive, when a
non-conformity is detected within a period of six months following the delivery
of the good, the non-conformity is presumed to have existed prior to the
delivery<sup>302</sup>. Thus, consumers can easily obtain one of the four
remedies listed (i.e. repair, replacement, price reduction or rescission) if
they find a problem with the good within such period. This is, again, an
improvement of consumers' rights.</p>
<p Align=left><strong>3. The time limit to lodge a claim</strong></p>
<p Align=left>Buyers confronted to faulty goods can only claim for remedies
within a time period of</p>
<p Align=left>303</p>
<p Align=justify>six years from the sale in England, Wales and Northern Ireland
and five years from the discovery of the problem in Scotland<sup>304</sup>.
This time limit also applies to consumers since the two years time limit
provided for by the Direct ive of 1999 has not been transposed in the UK.</p>
<p Align=center>The time limit is satisfactory in Scotland where it begins at
the detection of the<br>problem. It can be argued that in England, Wales and
Scotland there are situations<br>where the six years time limit beginning at
the sale of the good will be too short.</p>
<p Align=justify>Indeed, as regard some goods which are supposed to last for a
very long time, such as cars for instance, buyers might discover that they do
not conform<em> after </em>this period of six years has elapsed. However, I
believe that six years is a rather long period which strikes a fair balance
between buyers' protection and sellers' interests and needs for legal
security.</p>
<p Align=center><strong>***</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The French and the UK's system are very different. Indeed, a
consumer buying a good in London can rely on a single set of rules which he can
easily put in practice without any judge's help. Conversely, a consumer
acquiring an item in Paris has many grounds on which he can rely to complain,
but most of them require him to go to court. Thus, generally speaking,
consumers enjoy a better protection in the UK than in France. These differences
show how diverse can be the protection of consumers and highlight the
fragmentation of the legal rules applicable to consumers in Europe. This is at
the core of the Commission's critiques and explains why the Proposal it has
launched on 2008 aims at full harmonisation. However, arguably, nor the method
of unifying consumer protection neither the Proposal's content are good ways to
protect consumers.</p>


<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc8"></A>II. The Proposal for a directive on consumer rights -
How good is it for consumers?</h1>

<p Align=justify>The Proposal for a directive on consumer rights is part of a
process of reviewing the Consumer Acquis <sup>305</sup> which started in 2004
with the aim to simplify and complete the existing regulatory fram ework
regarding consumer law<sup>306</sup>. The objective of the Review is the
creation of a consumer internal market which rightly balances the call for
competitiveness in the business field and the need for high protection as
regard consumers<sup>307</sup>. Albeit these two aims seem at first sight
divergent, providing that an adequate balance is stricken in the Proposal, the
rules it lays down are said to have many positive consequences for both
consumers and business<sup>308</sup>. Before going any further, it shall here
be recalled that the Proposal brings together four existing
Directives<sup>309</sup>. However, as defined in the introduction, this work is
only aimed at analysing some of the consumers' rights provided for under the
Directive of 1999.</p>
<p Align=justify>The objectives pursued by the Commission are described at
length (A). However, when confronted to the content and the form of the
Directive, the Proposal seems unable to achieve its goal (B). Thus, as the
basis on which is erected the Proposal is undermined, there are calls for new
approaches capable of reaching the aims assigned (C).</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc9"></A>A. The Proposal's objectives and the ways to achieve
them</h2>

<p Align=justify>The Proposal postulates that there is a need for new rules
regulating consumer contract law and that these rules are better being
uniformed throughout Europe. The Commission's arguments justifying both
standpoints lie on the same basis, which is mainly economic: the completion of
the internal market .</p>
<p Align=justify>First of all, the Commission notes that the current practice
of regulating consumer law through minimal harmonisation directives has led to
a fragmented regulatory framework<sup>310</sup>. All further drawbacks
highlighted are said to steam from this observation. Firstly, the different
rules currently prevailing all over Europe are said to lead to high transaction
costs for business trading cross-border. Thus, these so-called compliance costs
often deter businesses, especially small and medium-sized
companies<sup>311</sup>, willing to provide goods and services to other
countries in Europe from so doing. As an example, responses from the green
paper showed that 55% of retailers considered the extra costs of complying with
the different rules in Europe as very important or fairly
important<sup>312</sup>. Secondly, even if business actors actually decide to
provide goods and services to other countries, the additional compliance costs
will be included in the prices. As a consequence, consumers are directly
affected since they have either a large choice of goods and services but at
high prices or either a restricted access to them. Thirdly, the fragmented
regulatory framework is also decried for undermining consumers' confidence and
to prevent them from shopping beyond the frontiers of their own country.
Indeed, they do not know on which rules they can rely on and the level of
protection they enjoy in a foreign country. Thus, they</p>
<p Align=justify>think that any problem occurring with goods acquired
cross-border will be very difficult to solve. Conversely, if they felt secure
in the transaction, for instance if they knew they are well-protected even in
another Member States, they would be more disposed to
contract<sup>313</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>For the Commission, these drawbacks stand as obstacles in the
development of the internal market and it is its duty to have them raised.
Indeed, it has to be recalled that the establishment and the development of the
internal market is, since the beginning, one of the European Union's
goal<sup>314</sup>. Thus, the positive consequences said to be brought by a
common set of rules applicable everywhere in Europe regardless of the country
concerned justify the Commission's intervention.</p>
<p Align=left>Put it in a positive manner, the Proposal's objectives are to:</p>
<p Align=justify>&#171;C<em>ontribute to the better functioning of the
business-to-consumer internal market by enhancing consumer confidence in the
internal market and reducing business reluctance to trade
cross-border</em>&#187;<sup>315</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>These objectives can be achieved by &#171;<em>decreasing the
fragmentation, tightening up the regulatory framework and providing consumers
with a high common level of consumer protection</em>&#187;<sup>316</sup>. As
the practice of minimum harmonisation is unable to put</p>
<p Align=left>317</p>
<p Align=justify>an end to the fragmentation of the regulatory framework , the
Commission is of the opinion that a full harmonisation Directive is the best
way to complete the aim assigned to the Proposal.</p>
<p Align=justify>It is worth noting that the Proposal is based on article 114
of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union<sup>318</sup>
(previously article 95 of the EC Treaty). This legal basis specifically states
that the Commission's proposals, in particular as regard consumer
protection,<em> take as a base high level of protection </em>&#187;319</p>
<p Align=left>must &#171; <em>a </em>. However,</p>
<p Align=justify>article 169(2) of the Treaty (previously article 153(2) of the
EC Treaty) on the Functioning of the European Union provides that measures
taken on the basis of article 114 are adopted for &#171;<em>the completion of
the internal market</em>&#187;. Conversely, in accordance with articles
169(2)(b) and 169(3), articles 169(4) states that the Commission's proposals
aiming at certain policy goals, including consumer protection, cannot prevent
Member States from &#171;<em>maintaining or introducing more stringent
protective measure</em>&#187;. As the Proposal provides for full harmonisation,
its primary goal is thus the development of the internal market<sup>320</sup>.
This might explain why the Proposal's content is, as we will see, not so much
consumer-friendly<sup>321</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left><strong>B. The Proposal's ability to reach its
objectives</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The analysis of both its content (1) and its form, which is to
say the fact that it provides for a full harmonisation directive (2), shows
that the Proposal as it is currently designed is not the best way to reach the
aims assigned to it.</p>
<p Align=left><strong>1. The Proposal's content</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The provisions regarding consumer sales and guarantees laid
down in the Proposal are mainly based on what was already stated in the
Directive of 1999<sup>322</sup>. As a matter of fact, while transposing it, a
lot of Member States provided for more protection than what was process
&#171;gold -plating&#187; 323</p>
<p Align=left>stated in this Directive, a called . However, they</p>
<p Align=justify>cannot do the same with the regime the Proposal sets forth.
Indeed, it provides for a<strong> </strong>full harmonisation directive which
means that Member States cannot maintain or introduce provisions different from
the one the Proposal 324</p>
<p Align=left>written down in . To put it</p>
<p Align=justify>concretely, this means that all provisions exceeding those
laid down in the Directive of 1999 will have to be repealed by the Member
States<sup>325</sup> . Thus, the content of the provisions and the exact
protection they grant to consumers are ought to be carefully analysed.</p>
<p Align=justify>This Proposal is highly criticised since except on a few
matters, there is no real improvement of the protection already existing. Even
worst, with the full harmonisation provided for by the Proposal, some rules
which were satisfying as setting a minimum level of protection for consumers
appear to be too low and thus questionable as they have to be transposed
exactly as they are stand in the Proposal. More precisely, it will be seen that
their implementation in some Member States, as France and the UK for instance,
would lead to a decrease in the protection already given to
consumers<sup>326</sup>. Moreover, this part will also show that many
provisions stated in the Proposal are far from being clear and need to be
interpreted by judges. Likewise, the rules stated do not give any bargaining
power to consumers in case of disagreement with sellers. Finally and more
generally, it will be</p>
<p Align=justify>demonstrated that the Proposal's rules are not designed to
reach the objectives assigned to it.</p>
<p Align=justify>All these consequences are to be avoided since consumers
regard as natural any improvement of the law protecting them whereas any
regression is seen as unjustifiable<sup>327</sup>. As such, the regression
resulting from the proposal in some Member States will undermine the European
Union's legitimacy. This potential outcome is not to be underestimated
providing that one of the final aim of the harmonisation of European law is the
building of the Europe of the citizens<sup>328</sup>.</p>
<p Align=center>However, it is worth noting that V. Reding, in her first speech
as the new<br>Commissioner responsible for the Proposal, declared that
&#171;<em>it is clear that the proposal</em></p>
<p Align=left>&#187;329</p>
<p Align=justify><em>as it is today does not offer the right level of
protection on all issues </em>. She then added that she was going to work with
the Parliament and Member States in order to increase the level of consumer
protection stated in the Proposal. Thus, when assessing the Proposal, it must
be kept in mind that amendments are going to be added.</p>
<p Align=center>The Proposal provides that seller must deliver goods which are
conforming<sup>330</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left>331</p>
<p Align=justify>Conformity of the good is to be assessed at the time of the
delivery . Thus, the assessment of the Proposal will be made by first analysing
the rules as regard delivery of the good (a) and by having a closer look to the
regime set as regard nonconformity (b).</p>
<p Align=left>a. The delivery of the good</p>
<p Align=justify>Provisions regarding the delivery of the good are in practice
important for consumers, especially when they buy goods online. As this issue
was not dealt with under the Directive, it is a great step forward that it is
tackled by the Proposal. Its article 22 states that the material possession of
the good must be transferred within 30 days</p>
<p Align=left>332</p>
<p Align=justify>from the date of the conclusion of the contract . This is a
default rule and parties are allowed to agree for a longer or a shorter period.
If the seller fails to make a delivery in the agreed period, the consumer is
entitled to a refund of any sum he has paid within seven days after the date
when the delivery was supposed to take place<sup>333</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left>of a long 334</p>
<p Align=left>First all, be</p>
<p Align=left>it can noted that, rule,</p>
<p Align=left>as default period</p>
<p Align=left>the stated is rather .</p>
<p Align=justify>Indeed, in most cases, when the good is purchased directly at
the store for instance, the delivery would be expected to take place
immediately. Moreover, even though the delivery has to be made after the
conclusion of the contract, 30 days remain a long period. Currently, most of
the Member States provides that the delivery must take place within a
reasonable period which is less than 30 days, and some of them</p>
<p Align=left>335</p>
<p Align=justify>even states that the delivery has to take place immediately .
As long as parties can freely provide for another period if necessary, it seems
difficultly understandable why the default rule is so long. It thus seems to
move back consumers' rights as they stand now in most Member States.</p>
<p Align=center>In addition, no guidance is given as regard the notion of late
delivery and non-<br>delivery. To put it concretely, when is a consumer
confronted to a late delivery and/or</p>
<p Align=justify>a non-delivery? These are classic questions which courts have
to solve <sup>336</sup> and for which answers might vary. It is thus
regrettable that the Proposal does not precise them further. As it provides for
full harmonisation, this task should be fully undertaken and should not leave
such important issue to Memb er States an. This is not in line with the
Proposal's aim to put an end to the fragmentation of the rules amongst Member
States.</p>
<p Align=left>b. The regime for non-conforming good</p>
<p Align=justify>The assessment of the Proposal will be made by first analysing
all issues pertaining to non-conformity of a good (i), the time limits allowed
to lodge a claim (ii) and the remedies available for consumers (iii).</p>
<p Align=left>i. The non conformity</p>
<p Align=justify>Provisions regarding non-conformity are at the core of the
balance which is to be found between the consumers and the sellers' interests.
Indeed, non-conformity is the reason why a consumer will complain to the seller
and, consequently, is the very object of the disagreement or even the
litigation arising between them. More than the notion of non conformity itself
(<strong>a</strong>), what is important is the presumption attached to it
(<strong>(3</strong>) and the duty to notify any non-conformity
(<strong>y</strong>).</p>
<p Align=center>&aacute;. The notion of non-conformity</p>
<p Align=justify>Article 24(2) of the Proposal specifies what is exactly meant
by non-conformity and replicates almost <em>verbatim </em>the provisions
already laid down in the Directive of 1999. Thus, we will not develop this
point.</p>
<p Align=justify>However, the Proposal brings a slight change in its article
24(3) which , as tiny as it seems at first sight, can have in practice
significant consequences. The Proposal specifies that there is no lack of
conformity if the consumer, when contracting, was aware or &#171;<em>should
reasonably have been aware</em>&#187; of the non -conformity of the good
purchased<sup>337</sup>. As a comparison the existing Directive provided that
there is no lack of</p>
<p Align=left>338</p>
<p Align=justify>conformity if the consumer &#171;c <em>ould not reasonably be
unaware </em>&#187; of it . Where the Directive states a negative rule
(consumers &#171;<em>could not</em>&#187;), the Proposal provides for a
positive rule (the consumer &#171;<em>was</em>&#187; and
&#171;<em>should</em>&#187;). Thus, one can wonders whether the modification
brought by the Proposal could be interpreted as putting on consumers an onus to
investigate the good before purchasing it<sup>339</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>If such interpretation was to be true, the Proposal would go
too far since it would impose on consumers an unfair and too heavy duty. It is
not denied that consumers claiming for a remedy because of an obvious defect
they could not be unaware of are likely to be acting in bad faith and should
not be granted such remedy. However, consumers are ought to think that any good
looking normal at first sight is actually normal. This is especially true as
regard complicated goods such as laptop as well as for pre -packaged good for
which an examination is in fact impossible<sup>340</sup>. Even the Vienna Sales
Convention itself, which applies to international sales contracts</p>
<p Align=left>occurring between <em>professionals, </em>does not put such a
duty on the buyer's shoulders<sup>341</sup>.</p>
<p Align=center>&acirc;. The presumption of non-conformity</p>
<p Align=justify>When a good does not work properly or does not work at all, it
can be difficult to prove whether this problem comes from a defect affecting
the good or whether the good has in fact been badly used or damaged after it
has been purchased. This is especially true concerning complex goods, as
cameras for instance. Thus, the outcome of the case often depends upon the
party on which lies the burden of proof. Indeed, it is as hard for a consumer
to prove that the good purchased is actually defective than for a seller to
prove that it is the consumer who is responsible for the problems which
occurred<sup>342</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left>That why s principle the six presumption 343</p>
<p Align=left>is the Proposal the</p>
<p Align=left>replicate of months</p>
<p Align=left>already laid down in the of 1999 344</p>
<p Align=left>Directive . It however changes the moment when</p>
<p Align=justify>the period begins (the passing of risk in the Proposal instead
of the delivery in the Directive of 1999). Indeed, if during the first sixth
months after the passing of risk a problem occurs, the defect is presumed to
have already existed when the risk passed. Conversely, if the defect appears
after the first sixth months, then it is the consumer who has to prove that the
problem occurred because the good is defective. It shall here be recalled that
in fact, risks pass usually at the delivery of the good<sup>345</sup>. This
rule seems to be reasonable and to strike an equitable balance between the
consumers and the sellers' interests. However, it can be regretted that such</p>
<p Align=justify>presumption is not further extended. Indeed, even though this
opinion is not agreed by everyone<sup>346</sup>, I think that the presumption
should apply after the good has been replaced or repaired. Indeed, in both
cases, the good was not conforming and a remedy was granted to the consumer.
However, the new good or the good replaced is ought to be as good as a new one
and I do not see why the presumption described above should not apply again in
these cases.</p>
<p Align=center>&atilde;. The duty to notify</p>
<p Align=justify>Article 28 of the Proposal provides that consumers, to be able
to lodge a claim for lack of conformity, must notify any such non-conformity
within two months after the moment they discovered it<sup>347</sup>. Such rule
was already provided for under the Directive of 1999 but, after many debates,
was made optional, and many countries did not implement it<sup>348</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>This rule seems to me to be unfair and hardly justifiable as
regard the overall balance of the Proposal. Indeed, consumers already have to
prove that the good they have purchased does not conformed and, except during
the first sixth months, that this non-conformity already existed when they
acquired it. Thus, I do not see the <em>rationale </em>of any rule aiming at
increasing the burden of the proof consumers have to provide. Furthermore I
think that a two months notice is anyway too short.</p>
<p Align=center>Moreover, providing that proving the existence of any
non-conformity will get harder<br>as the time passes, it is in the consumers'
interest to notify such lack of conformity as<br>soon as
possible<sup>349</sup>. Thus, if they do not actually notify such
non-conformity within</p>
<p Align=justify>two months, one can reasonably assumes that something
impeached them from so doing. As an example, if the good was purchased far away
from where is living the consumer, in a nother Member State for instance, all
information necessary to give any notice to the seller, at first place his
details, can be hard to find. As a result, such provision actually hampers
consumers' cross-border acquisitions since it will be harder, in practice, to
obtain a remedy for goods purchased in another country. Providing that the
Proposal seeks to facilitate cross-border transactions, this rule seems to be
even less understandable.</p>
<p Align=justify>As a matter of fact, this rule already existed in the current
Directive and was already implemented by some Member States. However, an
analysis of the overall context in these countries shows that this duty to
notify was implemented as a counterbalance to other rights already granted to
consumers. In the Netherlands for instance, such duty exists but the consumers
have the possibility to claim for remedies throughout the economic life span of
the product and can freely choose the remedies they prefer. Accordingly,
stating a duty to notify was seen as counterbalancing such strong power given
to consumers. Providing that no such power is given to consumers in the
Proposal, the imposition of a duty to notify is highly questionable.</p>
<p Align=justify>Finally, it must be noted that the Proposal's provisions are
rather lapidary and do not tackle the consequences of a failure of the duty to
notify. Does the consumer lose all remedies? That would be very harsh. In any
case, here again, the Proposal's rule is not clear enough and, if it was to be
adopted as it currently stands, would lead to a decrease in the protection
granted to consumers in many Member States.</p>
<p Align=left>ii. The duration of the guarantee: the two years cut-off
period</p>
<p Align=justify>The provisions as regard the duration of the guarantee are at
the heart of any set of rules regulating consumer sales since they provide for
the length of time during which consumers are entitled to claim for a remedy in
case of non-conformity. While consumers call for a long period, businesses
argue that they are in need for some legal certainty and cannot carry the risk
of hav ing to comply with consumers' complain for a too long period. As in the
current Directive<sup>350</sup>, the Proposal provides that consumers have two
years from the delivery of the good to lodge a claim for
non-conformity<sup>351</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>The Proposal provides for a full harmonisation directive. As a
result, the two years period originally stated as a minimum guarantee in the
Directive of 1999 is now turned into a maximum period from which Member States
cannot derogate. Such consequence is highly questionable and many authors see
this short period as a &#171;<em>large step back</em>&#187;<sup>352</sup> in
consumers' protection and argue for its deletion or, at least, its
extension.</p>
<p Align=justify>In addition, it must be noted that this two years period
starts right at the delivery of the good and not at the discovery of the
non-conformity. This means that after this two years period, even though
consumers can prove that the good they acquired does not conform and that such
non-conformity already existed at the moment of the delivery, they will not be
entitled to claim for remedies. Thus, this period is too short, especially for
goods which are expected to last for much longer than two years. Consequently,
if consumers want to enjoy a longer protection when buying these</p>
<p Align=justify>kind of items, their only choice is to purchase a commercial
guarantee which is often costly. Moreover, such short period does not work as
an incentive for producers to design goods intended to work for a longer
period. Such outcomes can hardly be seen as protecting consumers.</p>
<p Align=center>Moreover, a lot of Member States allowed for a longer period.
As an example, the<br>legal guarantee lasts for up to five years in Norway and
Scotland, six years in<br>England, Wales and Northern Ireland and throughout
the economic lifespan of the</p>
<p Align=left>353</p>
<p Align=justify>good in the Netherlands . In these Member states, the
implementation of a two years period would have odd effects. Indeed, in the UK
and in the Netherlands for instance, this longer period concerns all contract
of sales and is therefore applicable for both consumers and non-consumers.
Thus, if the Proposal's provisions were to be applied as they stand now in
these countries, non-consumers would enjoy a greater protection than consumers.
Thus, the latter would be likely to pretend they are not consumers or were not
acting as consumers when purchasing the nonconforming good in order to
beneficiate from the better rule<sup>354</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>Technically speaking, there are two ways to improve the
existing rule: either provides for a longer period, such as the six years
period in England, Wales and Northern Ireland for instance, or to states that
this two years period begins at the discovery of the non -conformity of the
good, such as in France as regard the two years period for latent defect for
instance.</p>
<p Align=center>Furthermore, it is to be noted that there is no suspension of
the two years cut-off<br>period when the goods are under repair. Conversely, in
case of reparation, a new</p>
<p Align=justify>period of two years applies from the moment when the consumer
is in possession of the replaced good<sup>355</sup>. Such difference is rather
surprising providing that a consumer who had his good repaired is as much
entitled to expect for a conforming good for a period of two years as a
consumer who had his good replaced. Moreover, since sellers are the one who
have the choice between repair and replacement<sup>356</sup>, one can assume
that, in addition with the fact that it is generally less expensive, they will
prefer to carry out repair to avoid the renewal of the two years period.
Finally, as<em> </em>such, this provision will not encourage sellers to be
diligent in the reparation of the goods<sup>357</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left>iii. The remedies</p>
<p Align=left>The Proposal provides that consumers are entitled to repair,
replacement, price reduction and rescission (<strong>a</strong>) as well as for
damages (<strong>13</strong>).</p>
<p Align=center><strong>a</strong>. The hierarchy in the remedial scheme:
repair or replacement first, price<br>reduction or rescission second</p>
<p Align=justify>The hierarchy was already provided by the Directive of 1999
which functioning has already been detailed (<em>A. The Directive of 1999 on
certain aspect of the sale of goods and associated guarantees</em>). Thus, this
part only aims at analysing the changes made to it and at explaining the
consequences that its implementation in all Member States would have.</p>
<p Align=justify>When transposing the Directive of 1999, some Member States
have chosen to implement the hierarchy, such as Germany and France for
instance, whereas some other States, UK, chose to choice consumers 358</p>
<p Align=left>as</p>
<p Align=left>such the leave the to . In the UK,</p>
<p Align=justify>all buyers are entitled to reject the good at a first stage.
However, as the Proposal provides for a full harmonisation directive, the UK
would not be allowed to leave such remedy to consumers. Thus, where
professional buyers would be able to terminate the contract and reject the good
if it appears to be non -conforming, rules would be less consumer-friendly for
consumers who would, as a first tier of remedy, be only able to ask for repair
or replacement. This absurd situation shows that as it stands now, Member
States are likely to be unwilling to accept the Proposal.</p>
<p Align=justify>Moreover, under the Proposal, consumers' possibility to choose
between the remedies is even more restricted than under the Directive. Indeed,
the latter let the primary choice between all remedies to the consumer:</p>
<p Align=justify>&#171;<em>In the first place, the consumer may require the
seller to repair the goods or he may require the seller to replace them, in
either case free of charge, unless this is impossible or
disproportionate</em>&#187;<sup>359</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left>Conversely, the Proposal states:</p>
<p Align=left>&#171;<em>The trader shall remedy the lack of conformity by
either repair or replacement according to his
choice</em>&#187;<sup>360</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>Thus, under the Proposal, consumers cannot even choose the
remedy they think the most appropriate to solve the lack of conformity they
suffered. Such restriction is questionable as consumers are the prejudiced
party and should therefore be able to choose. If it is true that sellers are
not necessarily at fault when delivering a nonconforming good since they can be
unaware of such non -conformity, consumers are definitely not at fault
themselves. Thus, sellers should be the party who carries the risk and should
not be given the power to select the remedy. Moreover, as they are primarily
concerned with financial considerations, they are likely to choose the less
costly solution which will often be the repair of the good, even though the
good should in fact be replaced. Furthermore, consumers are left with no
bargaining power since they have to accept the remedy chosen by the seller. In
the consumers' field, such bargaining power is of great significance since in
practice, it is the first defense consumers can oppose to sellers. The second
defense is the judge but, as already highlighted, consumers are often unlikely
to go to court, especially when the good at stake is not very expensive. Thus,
the Proposal's provision leads to an unwelcome decrease in consumers'
protection<sup>361</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>In addition, in practice, contrarily to the result sought,
this Proposal's rule is likely to prevent consumers from purchasing goods
abroad. Indeed, as they cannot ask for the termination of the contract, they
will have to accept a repair or the replacement of the good. However, if the
item has been bough abroad, that means consumers will have to send it back to
the seller and then wait for it to be repaired or replace. Such scheme involves
a heavy process which lies on consumers who will thus prefer to buy goods close
to the place where they are living as it will then be easier to comply with the
Proposal's provisions.</p>
<p Align=justify>Moreover, when it comes to price reduction and termination of
the contract, th e rules appear to be unclear and ambiguous. As an example, no
guidance is provided regarding the calculation of the price reduction. Yet, as
sellers are in a more powerful position, they can impose their way of
calculation which can then be at the consumers' disadvantage. Thus, for the
sake of consumers' protection, more details on this point would have been
welcomed.</p>
<p Align=justify>Likewise, no information is given as to the way the contract
is to be terminated and the consequences attached to such termination. Thus,
these issues are left to national laws, which is rather surprising considering
the fact that the termination of the contract is likely to be problematic and
considering the aim of the Proposal which is to harmonise the law on field
362</p>
<p Align=left>his</p>
<p Align=left>t . As a matter of fact, Member States provide for</p>
<p Align=left>363</p>
<p Align=justify>many different manners to terminate the contract . As an
example, in France, such termination has to be commanded by a judge (latent
defect and &#171;obligation de d&eacute;livrance conforme) or can be freely
used (lack of conformity provided for by the Ordinance of 2005) whereas in the
UK, consumers can freely choose it. Moreover, a lot of questions are left
unanswered such as how the parties have to undo the performances they have
already made. Indeed, providing that the rescission of the contract brings it
to an end with retroactive effects, questions such as whether consumers have to
pay for the utilisation of the good and whether the decrease in the good's
value and its fair wear and tear have to be supported by consumers are left
open.</p>
<p Align=justify>Furthermore, the reasons entitling consumers to claim for
price reduction and rescission of the contract are not enough detailed. The
Proposal states that consumers can claim for the second tier of remedy if:</p>
<p Align=left>&Ograve;<em>(a) The trader has implicitly or explicitly refused
to remedy the lack of conformity</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p Align=left>(b)  <em>the trader has failed to remedy the lack of conformity
within a reasonable time</em></p>
<p Align=left>(c)  <em>the trader has tried to remedy the lack of conformity,
causing significant inconvenience to the consumer</em></p>
<p Align=left>(d)  <em>the same defect has reappeared more than once within a
short period of time</em>&Oacute;<sup>364</sup>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p Align=center>If the Proposal gives helpful indication by saying that the
assessment of the<br>&#171;<em>reasonable time</em>&Oacute; and the
&Ograve;<em>significant inconvenience</em>&Oacute; has to take into account
the</p>
<p Align=center>nature of the good and the purpose for which the consumer has
purchased it, in</p>
<p Align=center>practice, these notions are likely to be debated at court and
will have to be explained<br>further by judges. Moreover, no further
explanation is given as regard the<br>reappearance of the defect within a short
period. This new limb is an improvement</p>
<p Align=justify>since it was not provided by the existing Directive. However,
the notion of &Ograve; <em>same defect</em>&Oacute; is unclear since we do not
know whether it must affect the same good or the replace or repaired good. Here
again, this notion will have to be explained by judges. Such outcome is
questionable as rules applicable to consumers should be clear</p>
<p Align=left>enough to be understood and applied by both parties to the
contract and should be usable by consumers on their own.</p>
<p Align=justify>Finally, the remedial scheme does not take into account some
situations where consumers have lost all confidence in the sellers' and their
goods. In such cases, consumers will only be willing to bring the contract to
an end. As an example, if a car's brakes appear to be defective, the consumer
might not have trust in this car anymore and will not want to have it repaired,
replaced or even to have its price reduced. These remedies would simply be
inadequate as the consumer will just be willing to terminate the contract and
give back the car. However, following the Proposal's rules, the consumer would
be forced to accept a repair or a replacement. Thus, generally speaking, it can
be said that the Proposal's rules do not give enough flexibility as regard the
remedies available for consumers and should thus be amended.</p>
<p Align=center>&acirc;. Damages</p>
<p Align=justify>The existing Directive does not provide for any rules as
regard damages. Thus, this issue was governed by Member States' themselves
which all have different ways to tackle it. As an example the scope of damages
which can be recovered under French law is wider than under English law.
Surprisingly, the Proposal barely deals with this matter and only states that
&#171;<em>consumer may claim damages for any loss not remedied</em>&Oacute; by
the repair, replacement, price reduction or rescission, as the case may be.
This can be the case if a car's engine explodes and blows away a garage, for
instance. Under the Proposal, in such case, the consumer would be able to claim
for damages which would be awarded in accordance to his national rules. As a
result, differences between Member States in the way damages are to be granted
and as</p>
<p Align=justify>regard the scope of damages which can be recovered, such as
damages covering disappointment or distress for instance, will
remain<sup>365</sup>. This is questionable since the Proposal's aim is to
harmonise consumer sales.</p>
<p Align=center><strong>2. The Proposal's method - Full
harmonisation</strong></p>
<p Align=center>Full harmonisation is a rather new approach which was announced
in the 2002<br>Communication on the Consumer policy strategy 2002 -2006 of 7
May 2007<sup>366</sup>. It was</p>
<p Align=left>367</p>
<p Align=justify>then a method used in four Directives dealing with consumer
protection . As the Proposal is also following this approach, a lot is at stake
for Member States which will lose their sovereignty over some matters. As such,
&Ograve;<em>full harmonisation will probably be the most Proposal
</em>&#187;368</p>
<p Align=left><em>controversial aspect of the </em>. If this way of acting is
the best</p>
<p Align=justify>one in order to achieve the objectives stated by the
Commission, then little can be said to criticise it. However, from this
perspective, this approach seems in fact undesirable and has even been
described as a &#171;<em>toxic package</em>&Oacute;<sup>369</sup>. Indeed, the
meaning of full harmonisation is rather obscure (a) and a directive which
provides for full harmonisation does not seem to be the best way to achieve the
Proposal's objective (b). In addition, generally speaking, it is doubtful that
any unified solution is desirable (c).</p>
<p Align=left>a. The uncertain extent of the full harmonisation</p>
<p Align=left>Article 4 of the Proposal states:</p>
<p Align=justify>&#171;<em>Member States may not maintain or introduce, in
their national law, provisions diverging from those laid down in the Directive,
including more or less stringent provisions to ensure a different level of
consumer protection</em>&#187;.</p>
<p Align=justify>Likewise, two decisions delivered by the ECJ on 23 April 2009
make clear that in case of a full harmonisation Directive, Member States cannot
adopt rules which are more protective of consumers than those laid down in the
Directive. These decisions are concerned with the Directive on unfair
commercial practices<sup>370</sup> and state:</p>
<p Align=justify>&#171;<em>(...) the Directive fully harmonises those rules at
the Community level. Accordingly (...), Member States may not adopt stricter
rules than those provided for in the Directive, even in order to achieve a
higher level of consumer protection</em>&#187; <em>371</em>.</p>
<p Align=left>These decisions are confirmed by another decision delivered by
the ECJ on 14 January 2010 372<sub>.</sub></p>
<p Align=justify>The impossibility for Member States to keep their own existing
rules protecting consumers beyond the standards laid down at the EU level flows
clearly from both article 4 of the Proposal and the words of the ECJ itself.
However, the extent to which Member States are prevented from so doing remains
unclear. In other words, the ascertainment of what falls within the Directive's
scope and what does not is not self- evident. As V. Reding acknowledges
herself, this is due to the fact that the relationship between cons umer
contract law and general contract law is not clear<sup>373</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>To put it concretely, if the Proposal was to be adopted,
Member States would have to transpose it exactly as it stands and could not
maintain or implement different rules<sup>374</sup>. However, this is only true
in the fields which are regulated by the Proposal. Conversely, in other areas,
nothing precludes Member States from providing for different rules that those
laid down in the Directive. As an example, while Member States could not give
up the hierarchy of remedies for consumers, they would not have to provide for
it for all contracts of sales since the Proposal is only concerned with
consumer protection. Beyond this apparent simplicity, it can be difficult to
determine which fields are concerned with the Proposal and which fields are
not. To stick to our example, if there were a hierarchy of remedies applicable
for consumers whereas other buyers would remain free to choose the remedy they
want, would consumer be entitled to rely on the general law of sale and claim
for the remedy they want? If the answer is yes, then the Proposal's objective
to bring to an end the existing fragmented regulatory framework in Europe is
clearly illusory. Conversely, if the answer is no, which seems to be the right
way to interpret the notion of full harmonisation<sup>375</sup>, absurdly,
consumers would be likely to pretend they were acting for a professional
purpose in order to avoid being qualified as consumer and to beneficiate from
more lenient rules. Indeed, we have already seen that as they are currently
shaped, the French and the English rules protecting consumers are often
provided for all buyers<sup>376</sup>. Thus, providing that the Proposal leads
to a regression in consumers' protection, if France and the UK were only to
implement the Proposal in the field of consumer law, professional buyers would
be more protected than lay people buying as consumers. Such outcome is
described as a &#171;<em>legal mess</em>&#187;<sup>377</sup> and is highly
criticised by authors.</p>
<p Align=center>To avoid this &#171; <em>legal mess </em>&#187;, Member States
can rightly decide to extend the scope of<br>the Directive while transposing
it. Such process is referred to as &#171;spontaneous<br>harmonisation&#187; of
law and permits to preserve a certain unity and coherence between</p>
<p Align=left>378</p>
<p Align=justify>general contract law and consumer contract law . Thus, as an
example, Member States could decide that the two years time limit to lodge a
claim applicable to consumers is in fact applicable to all buyers. However,
this shows that the Proposal's influence in national law might be far greater
than assumed at first sight and that the frontiers between the Proposal and
national law are blurred and vague<sup>379</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>Moreover, as a matter of fact, the only thing certain about
full harmonisation as stated in the Proposal is the uncertainty it provides for
Member States as regard its influence on other fields it does not specifically
govern. Indeed, the Proposal will need the European Court of Justice (ECJ)'s
help to clarify its scope. However, in the mean time, no definitive answers
will be available and this will introduce legal uncertainty in all Member
States<sup>380</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>In addition, the Proposal threatens wide areas of national
law, both in France and in the UK. Indeed, some main features of consumers'
protection in France and in the UK are in the questioning room. As an example,
as it provides for a right to terminate the contract as a first tiers of
remedy, the English right of rejection is incompatible with the Proposal which
provides for a hierarchy in the remedies. Likewise, the French latent defect
provides that if the good appears to be defective, buyers have two years to
lodge a claim <u>from the moment they discovered the defect.</u> This seems to
be incompatible with the Proposal which provides for a period of two years
<u>from the passing of risk.</u> These are only examples and generally
speaking, many rules</p>
<p Align=left>deeply settled in national legal systems might have to be removed
in accordance with the Proposal.</p>
<p Align=right>b. Is a full harmonisation Directive the right way to reach the
Proposal's</p>
<p Align=left>objectives?</p>
<p Align=justify>Full harmonisation is the way chosen by the Proposal to
provide for a high level of consumer protection as well as to fulfill its other
objectives. However, we have already seen that full harmonisation does not go
without drawbacks and that its coverage area is unclear. These shortcomings are
ought to be further detailed in order to assess the Proposal's ability to reach
the aim it targets.</p>
<p Align=center>The Proposal points out the fragmented regulatory framework
currently prevailing in<br>Europe as being very costly for businesses willing
to sell goods or provide services in</p>
<p Align=left>381</p>
<p Align=justify>other member States and, thus, as hampering cross -border
transactions . However, no empirical evidences are given by the commission to
support this allegation and these costs have never calculated 382</p>
<p Align=left>been . Even more, as M. Loos argue, whether a</p>
<p Align=justify>common set of rules will increase cross-border trade and will
decrease prices for consumers is far from being certain<sup>383</sup>. In fact,
a lot of different reasons are said to prevent companies from doing business
outside the country where they are implanted, such as commercial practices,
languages, customs, lack of knowledge</p>
<p Align=left>384</p>
<p Align=justify>about people needs and about the right ways to meet the
demand... None of these concerns would be answered by a full harmonisation
Directive. In addition, if law is a factor of importance, tax law or procedural
law are more likely to be problematic than consumer law<sup>385</sup>.
Actually, the extent to which the fragmented regulatory framework</p>
<p Align=left>in Europe as regard consumer law actually impedes cross-border
business remains unknown<sup>386</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>The Proposal also justifies full harmonisation by saying that
the instauration of a common set of rules will strengthen consumer confidence
and is thus a way to allow them to fully enjoy the internal market. However,
here again, the Commission does not detail further this opinion and does not
give any evidence showing that consumers' confidence would be reinforced by the
implementation of a full harmonisation directive<sup>387</sup>. Albeit there is
a lack of studies on this matter, I do not believe that legal considerations
play an important role in consumers' decision to shop abroad or not.</p>
<p Align=center>In practice, one of the most common ways for consumers to shop
in another Member</p>
<p Align=right>388</p>
<p Align=justify>State is the internet. In this case, consumers are often
attracted by low pricesor by the fact that some items are only available
online. However, I doubt that they actually wonder which law will be applicable
to the contract they are going to conclude. It is even more doubtful that legal
matters can prevent them from buying on the internet. In fact, they probably do
not particularly care of the exact location of the seller as long as it does
not increase the price they will pay. Actually, it is interesting to notice
that even in their own country, consumers are generally more reluctant to shop
when they are far away from where they live because they know that if something
goes wrong, it will be harder to solve the problem<sup>389</sup>. This
disinclination is not due to the legal framework but to obvious geographical
considerations<sup>390</sup>. Thus, as long as consumers are ready to shop
online, they agree to ta ke the risk that if a problem arises, it will be more
difficult to solve. Hence, what is of significance is not full</p>
<p Align=right>&#187;391</p>
<p Align=justify>harmonisation since it is thus a &#171;<em>solution to an
irrelevant or non existent problem </em>. Instead, what really matters is the
Proposal's ability to provide consumers with a way to solve their problem
simply and, if possible, without any judge's help. A common set of rules
applicable similarly everywhere in Europe would assist consumers in the
understanding of their right <em>after </em>a problem occurred but would
probably not work</p>
<p Align=right>as</p>
<p Align=left>an <em>incentive </em>to make them purchase a good in a foreign
country.</p>
<p Align=justify>Moreover, generally speaking, it must not be forgotten that
consumers shop, first of all, in their own country. Providing that the proposal
will lead, in some Member States, to a decrease in the level of protection
consumers are currently enjoying, I do not see how this will strengthen their
confidence in the internal market. Instead, such consequence is more likely to
undermine consumers' confidence in the European institutions. Full
harmonisation is therefore likely to have more drawbacks than advantages. Thus,
a deeper analysis of the potential consequences of the Proposal should be
undertaken before going forward.</p>
<p Align=center>Furthermore, it should be kept in mind that even if the
Proposal's advantages exceed</p>
<p Align=right>392</p>
<p Align=justify>its shortcomings, full harmonisation is costly and, thus,
might not be desirable . These costs are, in particular, the price of the
implementation and interpretation of a new body of law which is, in a way,
alien to the national legal system of the country trying to adapt it or, more
likely, to adapt to it<sup>393</sup>. In addition, the existing directive has
just been adapted by member States which just get used to it. Thus, providing
for changes might not be desirable either for consumers and businesses for
which legal certainty is an important issue.</p>
<p Align=center>Finally, whether a full harmonisation Directive is the best way
to achieve<br>harmonisation remains an open question. More precisely, one can
wonder why the</p>
<p Align=right>394</p>
<p Align=justify>Commission did not cho ose to act through a regulation instead
of a Directive . Indeed, even though member States cannot derogate from the
rules laid down in a in the Proposal, they still need to transpose them. As a
result, Member States will still have different national laws using different
languages and concepts which might be interpreted differently. Therefore,
companies willing to trade in other Member States will still need to identify
the right law of transposition and to understand how it works alongside the
given law 395</p>
<p Align=left>countr y's national . Moreover, it must not be forgotten that</p>
<p Align=justify>full harmonisation does not prevent consumers from relying on
other legal basis to solve their problem. As an example, In France, consumers
would still be entitled to rely on the general law of contract and, for
instance, on the error on a substantive quality of the good, to ask the
termination of the contract which provided them with a good which was not at
all the one they were willing to acquire. Likewise, as we have already
highlighted, claims concerning the allocation of damages will be governed by
the national law of each Member States. Thus, the understanding of the system,
even harmonised at the European level, provided by these countries entails a
good understanding of their overall legal system. This process is neither
self-evident nor cost-free. Conversely, is a unified solution is to be taken,
for the sake of clarity a regulation would have made sense since it would have
been immediately and similarly applicable to all Member
States<sup>396</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left>c. Is a unified solution the ideal solution?</p>
<p Align=justify>More than merely aiming at the implementation of a particular
<em>rule</em>, the Proposal targets in fact a policy goal. Thus, in particular
in the field of consumer protection, I am of the opinion that a unified
solution is not desirable.</p>
<p Align=justify>The aim of the Proposal is to protect consumers as efficiently
as possible while taking into account reasonable interests of businesses. As
already highlighted, such process involves subtlety as it is necessary to
strike a fair balance between divergent interests. However, all Member States
have a different <em>conception </em>of what is a faire balance, depending on
the value given to the concept of freedom of contract for
instance<sup>397</sup>. Thus, as an example, the Czech Ministry on Trade and
Industry made clear that it regards consumer protection as an aim as long as it
does not &#171;<em>restrict the economic activity of
vendors</em>&#187;<sup>398</sup>. Conversely, we have seen that the UK has for
instance a more generous conception of what is a fair balance. Moreover, Member
States also have different priorities and preferences and are thus unlikely to
strike the balance similarly<sup>399</sup>. Hence, there is no unique answer.
Even more, there should not be any unique answer. Indeed, jurisdictions
providing for different rules can learn from each other<sup>400</sup>. This is
especially true since commercial practices and, thus, ways to protect consumers
continuously change. Therefore, the best scheme to protect consumers is not yet
fully found and is in fact varying. As a consequence, I am of the opinion that
leaving alongside different legal systems providing for different answers is
the best way to follow commercial practices and to protect efficiently
consumers. Put it concretely, I believe that it is better to state only a
minimum threshold of protection than to provide for uniformed and static
rules.</p>
<p Align=justify>In addition, if unified rules are laid down, they should be as
good as possible and, even more, &#171;future proof&#187;<sup>401</sup> .
Indeed, as Member States will not be allowed to modify them and as any
amendment would have to be undertaken at the European level, any flow affecting
the rules could only be corrected after a lengthy and heavy
process<sup>402</sup>. In the mean time, the flaw would remain and would
undermine consumers' confidence. A text is in fact &#171;future proof&#187; if
two conditions are met: first, if the provisions laid down are good and there
is no<u> legitimate claims</u> for any amendment and, second, if the text is
<u>flexible</u> enough to adapt to upcoming and unknown economic
practices<sup>403</sup>. As a matter of fact, the Proposal is fairly criticised
and flexibility is a quality inherently alien to a process aiming at providing
for uniformed rules.</p>
<p Align=justify>Furthermore, as said, the striking of the balance and the
conception of what is a fair balance between consumers and businesses'
interests is different depending on the legal system, culture and history of
any country. Thus, if any law can be &#171;ideal&#187;, what would be ideal in
a country would most probably not be a good rule in another country. That is
why the Proposal leads to regression in some countries while it leads to an
improvement of consumers' protection in other Member States<sup>404</sup>. To
sum up, a unified solution which,<em> per se</em>, lacks flexibility and is
mechanical in its application, is arguably a bad solution for consumers.</p>
<p Align=left><strong>C. Alternative solutions</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Now that we have demonstrated that, as it currently stands, it
is doubtful that the Proposal will reach the aims targeted by the Commission
and is thus, as it currently stands, undesirable for consumers, it is
interesting to have a look at other solutions which could better achieve these
objectives. This approach raises the question of what is the best level law
405</p>
<p Align=left>to regulate consumer . As a mater of fact, a single level</p>
<p Align=justify>regulation might not be the best solution. Thus, three
different ways can be followed, which all involve regulation on a multilevel
basis: full harmonisation on selective matters only (1), minimum harmonisation,
but at a high level (2) or the use of the &#171;blue button&#187; (3). These
suggestions will be assessed through their ability to complete the aims
assigned to the Proposal.</p>
<p Align=left><strong>1. Full targeted harmonisation</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>As we have pointed out, the main criticisms targeting the
Proposal concern the fact that it provides for a full harmonisation Directive.
Indeed, as such, the rules laid down become mandatory for Member States which
cannot provide for a better protection for consumers. However, if the Proposal
was providing for full harmonisation only on specific points which would be
those, in the Commission's view, which really need to be unified throughout
Europe, the Proposal would not faced so much opposition and would be more
likely to be accepted by Member States<sup>406</sup>. This solution is even
referred to as &Ograve;<em>the magical words</em>&#187;<sup>407</sup> and is
supported by many authors, including those of the<em> EC Consumer Law C
ompendium</em> who overtook an in-depth analysis of</p>
<p Align=justify>some European Directive's implementation in Europe, including
the Directive of 1999 <sup>408</sup>. In addition, it is worth noting that V.
Reding declared that she &#171;<em>will consider the option of more targeted
harmonisation where it is practical</em>&Oacute;<sup>409</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>The points to be fully harmonised would have to be clarified
but, following the Commission's reasoning, there would likely be those which
create barriers to trade. As an example, it could be thought that it is
important to unify the period during which consumers can lodge a claim in order
to provide legal certainty in the business field . Conversely, providing for a
strict hierarchy in the remedies consumers are entitled to claim does not seem
to be a major obstacle standing in the way of companies willing to provide
goods or services in other Member States.</p>
<p Align=justify>Thus, such solution would have the advantage to shape the
Proposal in a way which would enable it to reach its objectives. Indeed, as
major barriers to trade would be removed, or at least lowered, the level of
consumer protection would not, generally speaking, decrease. Enjoying both a
satisfying level of protection and some common rules they know and can rely on,
consumers would thus gain confidence in the internal market. In addition, this
solution would permit to leave to Member States their sovereignty over some
matters whose roots are deeply implanted in their history, culture and legal
system.</p>
<p Align=justify>However, arguably, such solution would not provide for any
simplification as it would create a system which would have a complex
relationship with national rules depending on whether a given rule is optional
or provides for full harmonisation. Moreover, the regulatory framework would
remain fragmented and would be ruled at</p>
<p Align=justify>the national level since Member States could keep some of
their provisions and would anyway have to <u>transpose</u> the Directive
themselves. As such, it would not bring clarity to consumer and business and,
though being better than a Directive providing for full harmonisation of its
whole content, is not desirable.</p>
<p Align=left><strong>2. A high level of minimum harmonisation</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>This solution would transform the current Proposal which
stands for full harmonisation to a new Proposal which, as the previous one,
would only provide for minimum harmonisation. However, the aim would be to
grant consumer with a level of protection far higher than in the current
Directive.</p>
<p Align=justify>The main advantage of such solution is to allow Member States
to keep their sovereignty over their law which sometimes goes at the heart of
their legal system. As an example, France could keep its systems of latent
defect and &#171;garantie de conformit&eacute;&#187; which are strongly linked
with the Civil Code and its history. Likewise, the UK could keep its right of
rejection which has been shaped by cases law and lies at the core of the law
ruling the sale of good. Moreover, the pro tection consumers could rely on
would be, generally speaking, higher. As such, consumers' confidence would
increase.</p>
<p Align=justify>However, such solution would not put an end to the fragmented
regulatory framework prevailing in Europe and thus, would not lower the costs
necessary to sell goods and services in other Member States. As such, this
solution is unlikely to attract the Commission's approval.</p>
<p Align=left><strong>3. The so-called &#171;blue-button&#187;</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>This &#171;blue button&#187; is also called the
28<sup>th</sup> law as it would provide for a new set of rules regulating
consumers at the European level<sup>410</sup>. This new set of rules would
merely offer consumers another ground on which they could rely and this new
basis would exist alongside the existing provisions of Member States and would
not threaten them. As an example, this new regime could be set through a
regulation and, as such, would provide for exactly the same protection
everywhere in Europe. Thus, wherever they would be in the European Union,
consumers would always enjoy<em> de facto</em> a minimum level of protection as
they could always rely on this new regime.</p>
<p Align=justify>This solution would protect Member States&Otilde; existing
rules. However, the main weakness of this solution is that it does not provide
for any simplification in the regulatory framework in Europe<sup>411</sup>.
Even worst, it would probably further complicate some matters and would not
raise the so-called compliance costs standing in the way of businesses willing
to trade in other Member States.</p>
<p Align=justify>Nonetheless, I believe that this solution is the best one.
Indeed, as we have demonstrated, bringing to an end the fragmented regulatory
framework in Europe is very difficult, cannot be achieved with a full
harmonisation directive and is anyway not desirable. Thus, the &#171;blue
button&#187; solution can provide for a high level of protection for consumers
<u>similarly</u> applicable throughout Europe. As compared to a minimum and
full targeted harmonisation Directive, the law applicable within all Member
States would be the same. Thus, this would strengthen consumer's</p>
<p Align=justify>confidence in the internal market as they would know that
wherever they are, there is an efficient law on which they can rely if the
contract they are concluding goes wrong. As such, still keeping in mind the
Proposal's objective, this would lead to an increasing of cross-border
transactions and would thus permit the development of the internal market.
Finally, beyond the aims assigned to the Proposal, such solution would also be
an important part of a process leading to the creation of a commune culture
throughout Europe and, thus, to the creation of a Europe of the
citizens<sup>412</sup>.</p>


<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc10"></A>Conclusion</h1>

<p Align=justify>We have seen that the French and the UK's regulatory framework
applicable to consumers are very different. More precisely, we have highlighted
that the French traditional legal system does not provide for an efficient
protection of consumers as it is difficultly usable in daily transactions.
Thus, the Ordinance of 2005, albeit providing for<em> another</em> set of rule,
improves consumers' protection and is thus welcome. Conversely, in the UK,
consumers enjoy a great level of protection due mostly to the efficiency of the
system whereby consumers are allowed to reject non-conforming goods. The
transposition of the Directive of 1999 added to this protection on a few issues
but did not shatter the system as a whole.</p>
<p Align=justify>These differences demonstrate the variety of the existing
regulatory framework applicable in Europe. Such fragmentation of the legal
framework applicable throughout Europe is criticised.</p>
<p Align=justify>More precisely, we have seen that the Commission is concerned
with the increasing of cross-barriers transactions and the strengthening of
consumer confidence. Noting that a minimum harmonisation Directive cannot
achieve these goals, the Commission launched a Proposal providing for a full
harmonisation Directive. However, this Proposal seems hardly capable of
reaching the objectives it targets. Indeed, the fact that it provides for a
full harmonisation directive is not enough to increase cross-border transaction
and even leads to a decreasing in the level of protection consumers already
enjoy both in France and in the UK. Thus, the Proposal must undergo
modifications before it is likely to be accepted by Member States. In line with
the objectives it has been assigned, the most important change should be its
&#171;envelop&#187; as full harmonisation should be given up. Instead, it seems
that providing for a new set of rules <em>similarly</em> applicable throughout
Europe, a 28<sup>th</sup> law or at least a full <em>targeted
</em>harmonisation would better achieve the objectives of the Commission.</p>
