<p Align=justify> Rural areas are facing major challenges today which arise
mainly from globalisation, demographic change and the rural migration of young,
well-trained people. Policies for rural areas aim to contribute to recognising
and making use of strengths and opportunities.</p>
<p Align=justify>The rationale of this study is to describe how higher learning
institutions is contributing to rural development in Rwanda, this target has
been reached by studying  empowerment approach tackles composed of six 
components vulnerable to the poor like basic health/HIV and AIDS,  Rural
Development, income generation, food security, environment, and education.
These elements are assessed concerning the World Bank's four indicators: access
to information, inclusion and participation, accountability, and local
organizational capacity. Another insight is to disclose the opinion of the
people toward the development status of rural area before and after
SPREAD-NUR's assistance. Although the finding in this research showed that all
six aspects are improving in terms of development, the people are not empowered
in all six. Exceptions are in basic health, and environment. The common
misconduct is accountability from concerned parties.</p>
<p Align=justify> Overall, the people appreciate on SPREAD-NUR's services and
perceive that the community is developing in positive direction. To improve the
gaps above, it is recommended to strengthen on National University's
implication in Rural Development enforcement and policy intervention. Selection
of region of interest should be considered carefully while public services
should be improved and standardized. The community common interest should be
prioritized as well. Finally the next leaps of development should be studied
and further investigated. This dissertation is a contribution of the
SPREAD-NUR's knowledge on community development by empowerment approach in
rural development of Rwanda.</p>

INTRODUCTION</h1>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111785"></A><A NAME="toc9"></A>1.1. General
introduction</h2>

<p Align=justify> Rural areas are facing major challenges today which arise
mainly from globalisation, demographic change and the rural migration of young,
well-trained people. Policies for rural areas aim to contribute to recognising
and making use of strengths and opportunities. (Taylor P and J Fransman,
2004).</p>
<p Align=justify>Rural Planning in Rwanda aims to assist local stakeholders to
use information for managing their natural resources by providing methods,
tools, documented examples, and principles (or insights) that would help bring
about successful planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Land-use
administrations, institutions, and stakeholder groups can use planning,
monitoring, and evaluation as mechanisms for rural development. Scientists and
information providers can use them as entry points into development.</p>
<p Align=justify>More than 79.8% of Rwanda's population are to be found in
rural areas where hunger, literacy and low school achievement are common.
Education for a large number of people in rural areas is crucial for achieving
sustainable development in rural areas of Rwanda. Poverty education strategies
are now placing emphasis on rural development that encompasses all those who
live in rural areas (World Bank, 2008). </p>
<p Align=justify>Rapidly changing technologies and increasing globalization
also suggest that better education and training have become essential for
sustainable livelihoods and rural economy competitiveness (FAO/UNESCO Seminar,
5-7 November 2002)</p>
<p Align=justify>In 1997, the Kigali Institute of Science, Technology and
Management (KIST) was formed in Rwanda to address the serious loss of
professional manpower. In 2005 it was awarded the Ashden Award for sustainable
Energy for the large scale innovative implementation and use of Biogas System
within the Rwandan Prisons (

accessed on 19 September 2010).</p>
<p Align=justify>Kigali Institute of Education (KIE) is promoting Distance
Learning, and the Ministry of Education believes that the promotion of Distance
Leaning Policy Statement on teacher training and Management will set a clear
road map for professionalizing the teaching profession in Rwanda and help to
raise the status of teachers both economically and socially. The Ministry also
believes that efforts to improve teachers' capabilities to inculcate the right
kind of values attitudes and skills that will enable the children to become
productive citizens, will translate into real investment in the national
development context (Republic of Rwanda, Ministry of Education, 2007). </p>
<p Align=justify>Nowadays, the approach followed by policy-makers and education
specialists in developing Countries is to focus on practical and occupational
agriculture skill training provided mainly at the secondary and tertiary
levels. Yet, in an environment increasingly shaped by non-farming activities
linked to farming activities, and in policy context dominated by the poverty
reduction agenda through the development of commercial farming or cash-crops;
education for rural development requires a holistic approach going beyond the
narrow boundaries of the traditional agricultural education and training
concept (Faustine K.Bee, 2001)</p>
<p Align=justify>It is in this case that SPREAD in collaboration with National
University of Rwanda has created a partnership to monitor ABAHUZAMUGAMBI
Cooperative of MARABA coffee producer; The main objectives are to promote
MARABA Coffee on international level by providing methods, tools, documented
examples, and principles (or insights) to the producer of MARABA coffee that
would help bring about successful planning, monitoring, and evaluation while
improving the value added of MARABA coffee, promoting social wellbeing of
MARABA coffee producer and targeting rural development.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111786"></A><A NAME="toc10"></A>1.2. Background</h2>

<p Align=justify>In order for the producer of MARABA Coffee to take advantage
of opportunities for growth presented by coffee production and other sectors,
and to overcome supply side constraints, farmers and entrepreneurs of MABARA
Coffee are being supported through technical assistance and investment in
infrastructure and institutions by SPREAD and National University of Rwanda.</p>
<p Align=justify>Recognizing the limitations faced by the farmers of MARABA
Coffee to individually access on credit buyers, and low production with
critical quality SPREAD-NUR is working closely with ABAHUZAMUGAMBI Cooperative
to develop a range of coffee production, marketing and credit services for
these farmers with significant outcomes. And as targeted by SPREAD-NUR, the
value-adding activities of supporting the development of central pulpery
processing, credit access, improved marketing and the development of new
business models for Coffee translate into higher revenues, more income and
improved social wellbeing for the rural poor therefore rural development.</p>
<p Align=justify>Rural development refers to the actions and initiatives taken
to improve the standards of living in non urban neighbourhoods, countryside,
and remote villages. These communities can exemplify with a low ratio of
inhabitant to open space.</p>
<p Align=justify>World rural population are estimated to 57% in 1990 and 50.5%
in 2006, with 30% of land is covered by forests in 2005, with also permanent
cropland 1.1% in 2005, arable land 11% (World Bank, 2008).</p>
<p Align=justify>The programs of rural development are not concerned only with
the developing world; also the developed countries have very active rural
development programs. The main aim of the rural government policy is to develop
the underdeveloped villages.</p>
<p Align=justify>Rwanda known as a land of the thousand hills is a small
country in central Africa and one of the most densely populated nations. Rwanda
has experienced a series of civil and ethnics conflicts since the late 1950s.
In 1994 one million Rwandan people dead and displacing half of the country's
population</p>
<p Align=justify> 2008, 79.8% of Rwandans live in rural areas, with an average
growth rate of 0.6% on the land area of 24.7 thousand km<sup>2</sup> (in 2007),
with a permanent cropland of 11.1% of land area in 2005, arable land 48,6% in
2005 (World Development Indicators, 2008).</p>
<p Align=justify>Since this difficult period, and taking into account of the
percentage of the rural population, the government of Rwanda has sought to
rebuild the country by improving its governance. Rwanda poverty reduction
strategy paper focuses on poverty reduction, and the country's sustainable
economic development. </p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111787"></A><A NAME="toc11"></A>1.3. Statement of the
problem</h2>

<p Align=justify>Rwanda is a densely populated country in which a large
majority of the population depends on agriculture for subsistence. Major axes
of this sector are food security,  sustainable use of soil and water protection
and good management of the forests, as well as biodiversity conservation and
environment promotion.</p>
<p Align=justify>Rural development actions mostly aim at the social and
economic development of the areas. This program is usually top down from the
local or regional authorities, regional development agencies, NGOs, National
government or international development organizations. </p>
<p Align=justify>However rural development actions in Rwanda are still in its
emerging stages, this is why the sustained rural development is still doubtful
in Rwanda. Therefore this study will analyze the contribution of higher
learning institutions in rural development of Rwanda.</p>
<p Align=justify> </p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111788"></A><A NAME="toc12"></A>1.4. OBJECTIVES OF THE
STUDY</h2>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="_Toc274111789"></A><A NAME="toc13"></A>1.4.1. General objective </h3>

<p Align=justify>The general objective of this study is to analyze the
contribution of higher learning institution on rural development in Rwanda.</p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="_Toc274111790"></A><A NAME="toc14"></A>1.4.2. Specific objectives</h3>

<p Align=justify>The study aimed at achieving the following specific
objectives:</p>
<p Align=justify>&#183; To identify the role played by National University of
Rwanda in rural development of Rwanda.</p>
<p Align=justify>&#183; To understand the community's perception to
SPREAD-NUR's contributions.</p>
<p Align=justify>&#183; To recommend measures and model of empowerment to
enhance the effectiveness of SPREAD-NUR in promoting rural development in
Rwanda.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111791"></A><A NAME="toc15"></A>1.5. Research Hypothesis
</h2>

<p Align=justify>Higher learning institutions contribute to the process of
Rural Development in Rwanda.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111792"></A><A NAME="toc16"></A>1.6. Research Questions</h2>

<p Align=justify>&#183; Do higher learning institutions in Rwanda have an
impact on rural development in Rwanda?</p>
<p Align=justify>&#183; Is NUR contributing in rural development in Rwanda
especially in HUYE district where it is located?</p>
<p Align=justify>&#183; Is SPREAD-NUR's partnership significantly influencing
rural development basing on ABAHUZAMUGAMBI Cooperative members?</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111793"></A><A NAME="toc17"></A>1.7. Significance</h2>

<p Align=justify>The research will provide insights into important partnership
issues between SPREAD-NUR and rural community. It will try to measure levels of
empowerment from various aspects of SPREAD-NUR's contributions. </p>
<p Align=justify>The study will attempt to develop empowerment models,
strategies and tools for developing rural communities. The study will also
looks into the roles of SPREAD and NUR in rural development. All in all, it
unlocks and makes way for effective poverty reduction strategies based on
current perspectives which can be applied widely to handle MDGs and harmonize
cooperation among the key actors: civil society, the governments, and people.
</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111794"></A><A NAME="toc18"></A>1.8. Scope of the Study
</h2>

<p Align=justify>This study will be conducted in HUYE District, using the
selected Higher learning Institution National University of Rwanda in
collaboration with SPREAD to understand how they are influencing rural
development. And will only select the empowerment approach because it is the
focus of the project and is a new mechanism evolving in the development program
in Rwanda. There are many aspects to concentrate on but the study tends to
program effectiveness from the viewpoint of degree of satisfaction, objective
attainment, and perception and well being of coffee farmers grouped in
ABAHUZAMUGAMBI Cooperative.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111795"></A><A NAME="toc19"></A>1.9. Limitations </h2>

<p Align=justify>A limitation identifies potential weakness in the research.
One of the weaknesses in this research is that the researcher could not get
some of required data because of the respondents. Also because of limited time
and resources, this study was only limited to some of the aspects of Rural
development. </p>


<h1 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111796"></A><A NAME="toc20"></A>CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE
REVIEW</h1>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111797"></A><A NAME="toc21"></A>2.1. Introduction</h2>

<p Align=justify>This part gives an overall review of existing literature it
covers theoretical framework definitions of key concepts and different theories
about them. The overall purpose of this review is to know about the result of
studies related to topics under study.  </p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111798"></A><A NAME="toc22"></A>2.2. Introduction to Higher
Education for Rural Development</h2>

<p Align=justify>Education for rural people<em> </em>is crucial to achieving
both the Education for All (EFA) goals, and the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, ensuring universal primary
education by 2015, promoting gender equity and ensuring environmental
sustainability. (Eduardo Ramos and Mar&iacute;a Del Mar Delgado; 2005).</p>
<p Align=justify>In 1996, the World Food Summit in Rome stressed increased
access to education for the poor and members of disadvantaged groups, including
rural people, as a key to achieving poverty eradication, food security, durable
peace and sustainable development. The 2002 World Summit on Sustainable
Development, held in Johannesburg, also emphasized the role of education.</p>
<p Align=justify>As the majority of the world's poor, illiterate and
undernourished live in rural areas, it is a major challenge to ensure their
access to quality education. The lack of learning opportunities is both a cause
and an effect of rural poverty. Hence, education and training strategies need
to be integrated within all aspects of sustainable rural development, through
plans of action that are multisectoral and interdisciplinary. This means
creating new partnerships between people working in agriculture and rural
development, and people working in education. (Eduardo Ramos and Mar&iacute;a
Del Mar Delgado; 2005).</p>
<p Align=justify>To address this challenge, the Directors-General of FAO and
UNESCO jointly launched the flagship programme on <strong>Education for rural
people</strong><em> </em>(ERP) in September 2002 (http://www.fao.org/sd/erp/),
during the World Summit on Sustainable Development. </p>
<p Align=justify>This initiative involves an inter-agency approach to
facilitate targeted and co-ordinated actions for education in rural areas. It
is within this framework, and to provide inspiration for the flagship
initiative, that the FAO's Extension, Education and Communication Service and
UNESCO's International Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP) have jointly
launched a series of publications. This series is co-ordinated and edited by
David Atchoarena (IIEP) and Lavinia Gasperini (FAO). (Eduardo Ramos and
Mar&iacute;a Del Mar Delgado; 2005).</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111799"></A><A NAME="toc23"></A>2.3. Rural development,
Sustainable Rural development and Rural Public works projects</h2>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="_Toc274111800"></A><A NAME="toc24"></A>2.3.1. Rural development</h3>

<p Align=justify>Rural development<strong> </strong>in general is used to
denote the actions and initiatives taken to improve the standard of living in
non-Urban neighbourhoods, countryside, and remote villages. These communities
can be exemplified with a low ratio of inhabitants to open space. Agricultural
activities may be prominent in this case whereas economic activities would
relate to the primary sector, production of foodstuffs and raw materials.(
<A HREF="http://www.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow"><u>www.wikipedia.org</u></A>)</p>
<p Align=justify>Rural development is also multi-dimensional and much broader
than poverty alleviation through social programmes and transfers; it places
emphasis on changing environments to enable poor people to earn more, invest in
themselves and their communities and contribute toward maintenance of key
infrastructure; a successful strategy will make people less poor, rather then
more comfortable in their poverty (Cheam Phan Viriya, 2009)</p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="_Toc274111801"></A><A NAME="toc25"></A>2.3.2. Sustainable</h3>

<p Align=justify>sustainability is derived from increased local growth, and
were rural people care about success and are able to access resources to keep
the strategy going (Calestous Juma, 2000<em>)</em> and there are some
aspirational statements on this theme, the most commonly quoted being
Brundtland's: &#171;development which meets the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&#187;
(in Custance &amp; Hillier, 1998).</p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="_Toc274111802"></A><A NAME="toc26"></A>2.3.3. Rural Public works
projects</h3>

<p Align=justify>Rural Public works projects is the creation of rural
infrastructure through the mobilization of rural labour has long been the dream
of economic planners in developing world. The idea is simple one. In the end of
agricultural season, labour in the rural sectors of developing nations is
unemployed or underemployed. Therefore the opportunities cost of using that
labour on rural public works projects is zero or near zero ( although food
consumption may go up for people doing heavy construction work) (Malcolm Gills,
et al.; 1987).</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111803"></A><A NAME="toc27"></A>2.4. Rural Banks, Credit
Cooperatives, and development of rural markets</h2>

<p Align=justify>A<strong> </strong>second approach to the problem of providing
rural areas with sufficient capital for development is to establish rural banks
or credit cooperatives that will lend to farmers. In traditional agriculture a
farmer has only two sources of credit: members of this family and the local
moneylender. Because their location, urban banks lack the knowledge and skills
necessary to operate effectively in rural areas. </p>
<p Align=justify>On the other hand, local moneylenders know the reliability of
the people to whom they are lending and the quality of land put up as
collateral. Individuals without land, of course, have difficulty getting money
even from local moneylenders. (Malcolm Gills, et al. ; 1987).</p>
<p Align=justify>Credit cooperatives set up by the small farmers are one
potential solution to this problem. The idea is that each farmer is capable of
saving a small sum, and if these sums are pooled, one or two farmers can borrow
a substantial sum to buy a new thresher or pump. </p>
<p Align=justify>The next year it will be another farmer's turn and son on. In
the meantime those who put their money in the cooperative will draw interest,
thus encouraging them to save more. But this approach has flaws.</p>
<p Align=justify> Farmers' savings tend to be small, and hence the cooperative
tend to be financially weak. More seriously, farmers in developing nations have
little experience relevant to the effective operation and management of
cooperatives. In addition, economic, social, and political conflicts within the
village may make it possible to decide something as simple as who get the next
loan. (Malcolm Gills, et al.; 1987)</p>
<p Align=justify>There are virtually no areas of the world today where
substance farming in its purest form still exists. Economic of development is
usually accompanied by the increasing size and sophistication of this rural
marketing network, and in turn that improved net work has an important impact
on productivity in agriculture. The key to an increasing role for the market is
specialization, and specialization depends on economies of scale, low - cost
transport, and acceptable risk.  (Malcolm Gills, et al.; 1987)</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111804"></A><A NAME="toc28"></A>2.5. Development
actions</h2>

<p Align=justify>Rural development actions mostly aim at the social and
economic development of the areas. These programs are usually top-down from the
local or regional authorities, regional development agencies, NGOs, national
governments or international development organizations. But then, local
populations can also bring about endogenous initiatives for development. The
term is not limited to the issues for developing countries. In fact many of the
developed countries have very active rural development programs. (
<A HREF="http://www.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow"><u>www.wikipedia.org</u></A>)</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111805"></A><A NAME="toc29"></A>2.6. Mission, Vision,
Commitment Of Higher Learning Institutions</h2>

<p Align=justify>Universities were originally set up as a response to certain
needs of society which no other institution or group could meet. However, this
role, which clearly differentiated the functions and activities of
universities, has become blurred. With the passage of time, other institutions
have begun to concern themselves with research and teaching, sharing these
functions with universities or on occasion even surpassing or substituting
them. </p>
<p Align=justify>For these reasons, universities today must rethink their
social function. In order to do so, they must explain questions such as their
`mission', the `vision' of this mission and their institutional `commitment'
towards society. Something which was considered obvious for a long time must
now be reformulated and may be the cause of comparative and competitive
advantages between universities, since, for the first time in their history;
these institutions face a profound questioning of the principles which have
governed them up to now. (Eduardo Ramos and Mar&iacute;a Del Mar Delgado;
2005).</p>
<p Align=justify>The `mission' of the university is linked to intellectual
excellence developed through the three essential components of university life:
research, teaching and influence (Marcovitch, 2002). This mission must adapt to
the process of change of the society in which we live, although not all
universities are capable of achieving this to an equal degree. The tendency to
fall back on themselves and the need to do so in order to solve budgetary
problems often explains the difficulty of university institutions in responding
to new demands. </p>
<p Align=justify>However, at the present time, this mission must be capable of
going beyond the most local or localist approaches so as to respond to the
needs that arise from the greater interaction between sectors and territories,
which is a part of globalization. In the process of formulation of the mission,
which can be explicit or implicit, different components are involved, among
which the search for an independent model and the vision of the future role of
the university stand out. In this process, teachers play, as they must, a
fundamental part, together with the other groups which make up the university
community. (Eduardo Ramos and Mar&iacute;a Del Mar Delgado; 2005).</p>
<p Align=justify>The `commitment' of the university means its active
participation in the development process of society. This role involves on
occasion the expansion and the improvement of the relationship of the
institution with society, but at other times it requires a profound revision of
the mission of the university so that its lost role can be recovered. In order
to ensure that the part the university plays is as active as possible, it must
be directed towards teaching skills (the function which many universities have
been fulfilling almost exclusively for over a century), providing an education
in values, and building the capacity to reflect on the future (functions which
have been eroded with the passage of time). Therefore, the university's
commitment represents a kind of `contract' between the university and its
surroundings, which is one of the best ways for the university to establish and
carry out its real `social role'. (Eduardo Ramos and Mar&iacute;a Del Mar
Delgado; 2005).</p>
<p Align=justify>The `vision' of the university is the consequence of both its
mission and commitment since this can refer to the way society perceives the
role of the university, or the way the university intends to do what it does
and how this is understood. (Eduardo Ramos and Mar&iacute;a Del Mar Delgado;
2005).</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc30"></A> <A NAME="_Toc274111806"></A>2.7. Challenges Faced By
Institutions In Meeting Their Missions</h2>

<p Align=justify>Formulating and developing correctly the university's mission
and commitment means a series of challenges that particularly affect higher
education, which is facing the most radical transformation and renovation in
its history. This is mainly due to the following reasons:</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>1. Knowledge</em></strong><em> </em>not only
changes within each discipline but also in its overall coherence and
complexity. It is not possible to treat the complexity and the dimension of
scientific findings if knowledge remains confined to the traditional
disciplines. (Eduardo Ramos and Mar&iacute;a Del Mar Delgado; 2005).</p>
<p Align=justify>2.  <strong><em>Access </em>to knowledge</strong> is changing;
it can be reached from all directions and at any moment, but its abundance does
not mean that it is always validated, organized, and structured. The problem
for education today is not where to find information but how to offer access to
it without exclusion and, in turn, to teach/learn how to select it, assess it,
interpret it, classify it and use it. This conception profoundly modifies
teaching and the traditional role of the teacher. (Eduardo Ramos and
Mar&iacute;a Del Mar Delgado; 2005).</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>3. Technological tools</em></strong><em> </em>free
the university from limitations of time and space. The traditional class
consists of placing a group of students and a teacher in the same place at the
same time. Today it is possible to organize class activities in different
places and at different times. (Eduardo Ramos and Mar&iacute;a Del Mar Delgado,
2005).</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>4. The role of the teacher</em></strong><em>
</em>is no longer the same, and society's expectations in this respect are
increasingly numerous and complex. The teacher is the main agent of the
transformation of the educational system; he/she must train the citizens of
tomorrow and make them acquire scientific knowledge. In the present context of
change, a new concept of society is emerging which some call the `learning
society' due to the central role played by knowledge in the productive process;
others prefer to refer to it as the `information society'. Independently of
which terminology is used, it is evident that global changes are forcing a
change in the traditional role of teaching and are redefining the part played
by universities. (Eduardo Ramos and Mar&iacute;a Del Mar Delgado, 2005).</p>
<p Align=justify>As a consequence of the above reasons, the most important
challenges faced by higher education today are:</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>1. The change from an industrial society to an
information society</em></strong> The future of countries and their positioning
in the international context will largely depend on the solidity of their
systems for training human resources and their technological and scientific
research systems. In order to face these challenges, universities must widen
the space for the production of knowledge and adopt new approaches which permit
greater connection between the training that students receive and the new
demands of society. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>2. Going from simply demonstrating knowledge by
the issuing of certificates to training students in self-learning and fostering
the integral development of their human capacities</em></strong>. Contemporary
society and<em> </em>globalization impose a vocation for change which obliges
the university<em> </em>to incorporate imagination and creativity, and which
incites it to no longer<em> </em>be only at the service of a narrow
professionalization, as has unfortunately<em> </em>been the case up to now.
Future graduates must be accustomed to work<em> </em>in inter-disciplinary
teams, have a satisfactory understanding of world<em> </em>problems and speak
at least one foreign language. (Eduardo Ramos and Mar&iacute;a Del Mar Delgado,
2005).</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>3. Complementing knowledge based on the
acquisition of information with self-learning</em>.</strong> The new teaching
methodologies must encourage students<strong><em> </em></strong>to learn to
work, do research, invent, create, and not limit them to continue<strong><em>
</em></strong>memorizing theories and facts. In other words, the students must
participate<strong><em> </em></strong>in the educational process. In order for
them to do this, they must prepare<strong><em> </em></strong>themselves for
`self-training', `self-education' and `self-assessment', that<strong><em>
</em></strong>is, they must assume the responsibility for orientating
themselves and<strong><em> </em></strong>taking control of their own training.
</p>
<p Align=justify>The important thing is that it is really<strong><em>
</em></strong>the students who acquire the learning skills and that these
become a<strong><em> </em></strong>genuine means for development of the
individual or of society, in such a<strong><em> </em></strong>way that the
students can acquire useful knowledge, capacity for<strong><em>
</em></strong>reasoning, aptitudes and values (UNESCO, 1990). This new
conception<strong><em> </em></strong>implies that educators become facilitators
and also that they work as part<strong><em> </em></strong>of a team with their
students so as to identify and select problems. Students<strong><em>
</em></strong>must learn not only to memorize but learn to use all means of
information<strong><em> </em></strong>available to them, whether this is
through libraries, national and international<strong><em>
</em></strong>databases, the radio, the cinema, television or Internet.
(Eduardo Ramos and Mar&iacute;a Del Mar Delgado, 2005).</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>4. Training students so that they consider
life-long learning and rotating periods of work with periods of training to be
natural</em>.</strong> Life-long learning<em> </em>means having at one's
disposal the intellectual tools that are necessary<em> </em>for adapting to the
constant changes and the varying requirements of the<em> </em>job market and
for protecting oneself against the obsolescence of<em> </em>knowledge, which is
occurring at an increasingly rapid rate. </p>
<p Align=justify>Students<em> </em>now need to be trained for an unstable work
environment and probable<em> </em>rotation, not only between jobs but sometimes
even between types of<em> </em>occupation or economic sectors. In order for
this to be possible, not<em> </em>only are more skills needed but frequently
new and different ones, which<em> </em>place new and different demands on
educational and professional training<em> </em>systems. </p>
<p Align=justify>Higher education will play a fundamental part in
encouraging<em> </em>the capacity for innovation and creativity. A suitable
balance between<em> </em>general and specialized training is indispensable,
together with emphasis<em> </em>on learning processes rather than on
instruction or teaching processes.<em> </em>The new `curricula' must include
general training cycles, basic training<em> </em>cycles and specialized
training cycles; (Eduardo Ramos and Mar&iacute;a Del Mar Delgado, 2005).</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>5.  <em>New tools and skills</em>.</strong> New jobs
are bound to require flexibility, creativity, autonomy, innovation, speed of
adaptation to change, life-long study and team work. These demands imply
continuous adaptation to challenges such as handling new situations,
responsibility, participation, pluralism or changing values. The university
must prepare students physically, intellectually and emotionally so that they
can meet these demands when they graduate.</p>
<p Align=justify>The new context is characterized by uncertainty and by the
speed at which changes occur. Therefore, educational systems must be capable of
educating for change and uncertainty. The acceptance of change as an inherent
characteristic of higher education institutions implies accepting flexibility
as a work norm.  Universities and higher education institutions in general must
become &#171;life-long education centres for everyone&#187; (UNESCO, 1998).</p>
<p Align=justify>Accepting this challenge involves a series of transformations
in academic organization and work methods. Educators must essentially be
designers of learning methods and contexts, capable of working as a team
together with the students. In this way, educators, as they train, are training
themselves, and they learn at the same time as they teach (Eduardo Ramos and
Mar&iacute;a Del Mar Delgado, 2005).</p>
<p Align=justify>The establishment of closer and fruitful collaboration between
universities and the productive sector also makes it possible to diversify ways
to finance higher education, thus achieving growing participation of the
private sector in the overall financing of higher education, whether public or
private(Eduardo Ramos and Mar&iacute;a Del Mar Delgado, 2005).</p>
<p Align=justify>.</p>
<p Align=justify>The experience of introducing a `Higher Education System on
Rural Development' (HESORD) into the University of Cordoba (UCO) represents an
effort to adapt to all the challenges and trends described. In fact, HESORD was
not initially designed as a comprehensive system, but as a single higher
education initiative. It has been, however, the continuously increasing demand
for new products that has encouraged the launching of a wider educational
offer. This programme of studies is undergoing a complex process which concerns
three strategic aspects of the current university: mission, commitment and
vision. Furthermore, as explained below, this process is intended to be as
faithful as possible to modern trends in higher education, and to the role that
agriculture and the rural world will play in society in the twenty-first
century. (Eduardo Ramos and Mar&iacute;a Del Mar Delgado, 2005).</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111807"></A><A NAME="toc31"></A>2.8. Education's Role in
Development</h2>

<p Align=justify><strong>E</strong>ducation is different things to different
people. Besides the economic benefits already mentioned, education up to a
certain level has often seen thought of as an inherent right. Education has
also been promoted because it can socialize people. Through a common schooling
experience, it has often been thought; people from different national, social,
ethnic, religious, and linguistic backgrounds can be encouraged to adopt a
common outlook on the world. (Malcolm Gills, et al., 1987). finally education
is also thought to confer civic benefits and can be used to promote economic
development for example well trained workers, and who live in the villages and
work closely with the farmers when new techniques are being introduced.
(Everett E. Hagen, 1968)</p>
<p Align=justify>Expenditure to produce physical equipment for future
production is termed investment. Even though one accepts the judgment that
education can contribute greatly to productivity, one must be cautious in
assuming that the level and types of education provided in technically advanced
countries will increase productivity in less advanced countries. To take the
extreme example, skill in the use of  high -  speed computers would be useful
to extremely few individuals working in ,say, Ceylon and to none in Rwanda -
urundi (Everett E. Hagen, 1968) <strong>    </strong></p>

METHODOLOGY</h1>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111810"></A><A NAME="toc34"></A>3.1 Introduction</h2>

<p Align=justify>This chapter presents the methodological approach, the data
collection techniques and the entire process that was used to conduct the
study. It shows the methods that the researcher will use to collect and analyze
the data, the selection of the respondents, and it further spells out how the
information was obtained from respondents, analyzed and interpreted to enable
the researcher to draw logical conclusions.</p>
<p Align=justify>Kenneth D Bailey (1978: 83) defines the methodology as the set
of methods and principles that are used when studying a particular kind of
work. A method composes all intellectual process an orderly system or
arrangements that enable a researcher to reach an aspect of knowledge by using
various techniques.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111811"></A><A NAME="toc35"></A>3.2. Research Design</h2>

<p Align=justify>Christensen (1991: 269); defines research design as an
outline, a plan or a strategy specifying the procedures to be used in
investigating the research problem. It is simply the framework or plan a study
used as a guide in collecting and analyzing data. For the purpose of the
current study the survey method was adopted.</p>
<p Align=justify>The research Design of this study was an ex-post facto case
study; hence there was need of using comparative data of pre-SPREAD-NUR and
post-SPREAD-NUR project implementation. Thus, this study paid special attention
to the comparison between how the status of rural area prior to the entry of
SPREAD-NUR was and the situation after SPREAD-NUR's emergence, and the
perception of the people towards each element of the project regarding level of
Rural Development. </p>
<p Align=justify>To gather the needed data, fieldwork was conducted in the
rural Area, ABAHUZAMUGAMBI COFFEE      COOPERATIVE of MARABA, using
triangulation data collection technique. A
<strong><em>Questionnaire</em></strong><em> </em>was used to get perceptions
and development status. <strong><em>Observations </em></strong>were conducted
in order to double check the validity and confidence of the collected data.
<strong><em>Interviews</em></strong><em> </em>focusing on project
implementation and the assessment of development were also employed.
Ultimately, the data was analyzed as an empowerment assessment and presented in
comparative format.</p>
<p Align=justify>This study involved both qualitative and quantitative data.
The qualitative data collection technique was subjective in nature since it
involved examining and reflecting on financial recordkeeping in business.
Numerical data analysis and statistical tests were objective in nature and
dealt with measuring phenomena. For this study, computation of percentages,
frequencies and hypotheses testing was used.</p>

<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111813"></A><A NAME="toc37"></A>3.4. Sampling Method and
Sampling Size</h2>

<p Align=justify>ABAHUZAMUGAMBI COFFEE COOPERATIVE MARABA has 2000 members,
among them 66 respondent was select during this research. Therefore, the
researcher l completed a questionnaire survey of 66 member of ABAHUZAMUGAMBI
COFFEE COOPERATIVE living in Rural Areas basing on systematic random sampling
where by in every 30 persons one was questioned.</p>
<p Align=justify>Several reasons guided the selection of respondents. First in
order to know about the development status of the areas, respondents in Rural
Areas were needed. Second, by approaching the households and simple families,
perceptions of the people could be measured. Finally, it was considered
important to observe the actual living standard of people in the whole area
compared to the former living standard. This provided a better understanding of
the reality rather than relying on reports of the project's staff.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111814"></A><A NAME="toc38"></A>3.6. Data Collection</h2>

<p Align=justify>The research needed both primary and secondary data. The
primary data were obtained using questionnaire, interview, and field
observation from the people living in Rural Areas and being members of
ABAHUZAMUGAMBI Cooperative. Secondary data were sourced from historical
archives, annual reports, monitoring and planning documents of SPREAD-NUR about
the statistical characteristics and baseline data of the project's site.</p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="_Toc274111815"></A><A NAME="toc39"></A>3.6.1. Primary Data</h3>

<p Align=justify>Triangulation data collection was used as a qualitative
technique to get primary data for the research. It comprises three angles:
Survey questionnaire, in-depth interview and field observation.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Questionnaire</em></strong><em> </em>was<em>
</em>created to measure project components and empowerment indicators. It was
designed to compare the past and present condition of the community and
implementation of the project operation. It was designed to learn the
perceptions of the people, how they view LWF, and their satisfaction and
decision-making.</p>
<p Align=justify>Questionnaires included three parts with 50 questions. The
first part obtained general and basic information about respondents. The second
part included six components of Rural Development in terms of access to
information, participation, accountability, and organization capacity. The
final part aimed to direct the respondent's perceptions about their overall
view of SPREAD-NUR's project. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>The interview</em></strong> gave awareness of how
project carriers and facilitators view themselves in the roles of helping to
better the lives of poor people and their own future vision of the project
results when SPREAD-NUR withdraws. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Field observation</em></strong><em> </em>by this
the researcher was able to double check the accuracy and validity of
information about living conditions and development. This helped to validate
and ensure that the data was gathered correctly and effectively. During the
field survey, the researcher observed the way people lived and shared
information and experiences so that answers from questionnaires and interview
could be verified. </p>
<p Align=justify>Field observations were used to assess the accuracy and
reliability of data obtained from</p>
<p Align=justify>people about their ideas of sharing, their awareness of
rights, level of expression, education level, infrastructure inside each
commune, health services, public services, economic conditions, capacity
building, and community organizations. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="_Toc274111816"></A><A NAME="toc40"></A>3.6.2. Secondary data</h3>

<p Align=justify>Secondary data were considered necessary in backing up the
primary data.</p>
<p Align=justify>Available studies and information included different reports
on Rural Development, the current monitoring report and implementation progress
reports.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111817"></A><A NAME="toc41"></A>3.7. Data Analysis</h2>

<p Align=justify>After data collection, the following proper tools and
techniques were used for the classification and analyses of data. SPSS and
Microsoft Excel were used for the purpose of data analysis.</p>
<p Align=justify>Tools of classification of data were frequency distribution
and charts (charts are graphical representation of data). Along this study the
following Charts were used: Pie Charts, Bar Charts, Stacked Bar Charts, and
Histograms.  </p>
<p Align=justify>After this a comparative study of living conditions was
developed in order to measure how the social wellbeing has been improved among
the producer of MARABA coffee due to the SPREAD-NUR intervention in this Field
(Coffee Production). This analysis lied on the analysis of Mode of Coffee
production, Income, Properties, Housing type, Medical insurance, Education,
Information and Communication.</p>


<h1 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc274111818"></A><A NAME="toc42"></A>CHAPTER FOUR: DATA
PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS, AND INTERPRETATION</h1>

<p Align=justify>This chapter presents results drawn from collected data. The
target population was the members of ABAHUZAMUGAMBI Cooperative, whose main
activity is to grow coffee known as MARABA Coffee.</p>
<p Align=justify>Maraba coffee is grown in the MARABA area in southern province
of Rwanda MARABA's coffee plants are the Bourdon variety of the coffee Arabica
Species and are grown on fertile volcanic soil or on high altitude hills. The
fruit is handpicked mostly during the rain season between March and May and
brought to a washing station in MARABA, where the coffee beans are extracted
and dried. At several stages, the beans are stored according to quality.
Farmers receive credit based on the quantity of beans they provide.</p>
<p Align=justify>In 1999 ABAHUZAMUGAMBI Cooperative was created with about 200
members. From since the Cooperative has been supported by the National
University of Rwanda and SPREAD, and working hand by hand the Cooperative has
improved the Coffee quality and penetrated on international market.</p>

<p Align=justify>The level of empowerment is going to be discussed according to
the SPREAD-NUR's components based on empowerment indicators using collected
data. This is to measure the perception of people toward SPREAD-NUR's
contributions. Also the comparison between pre-SPREAD-NUR and post-SPREAD-NUR
existence will be discussed as well in order to reflect the people's perception
on the SPREAD-NUR and their community.</p>

ABAHUZAMUGAMBI surveyed, 60% of them rates food condition Sufficient, while 40%
of them see that food condition in their respective households is Insufficient.
This insufficient in food taken per day was supported by the number of meals
that they take per day, as the below figure demonstrates the majority of
respondents take meals Two times per day (67%), while the remaining part of
respondents reported that it takes meals Three time per day (33%), and among
respondents there is no case of persons who take meal once per day. Even though
the majority of respondent agrees that their meals in take have been increased
and ameliorated due to the intervention of SPREAD-NUR in the plantation of
coffee in their area. </p>

<p Align=justify>In order to control food quality and quantity in their
households when food is not enough, most of respondents reported that they take
orientation in farming (50%), 43% of them takes orientation in labor sale, 4%
Raises livestock, and 4% in trading.</p>
<p Align=justify>As the members of ABAHUZAMUGAMBI Cooperative are working with
SPREAD NUR they agree that there has been an improvement in food in take, this
means that the intervention of SPREAD-NUR in rural area is developing the way
of living of rural people. It is also understandable that with the improvement
of food many diseases from unbalanced food are eliminated, and therefore
population are away of concentrating on improving their social wellbeing toward
Development. 68% of total respondents reported that food served in their
household has been improved while only 32% disagreed this assertion, as shown

Basic health and HIV and AIDS</h2>

<p Align=justify>According to respondents' views, the awareness, which measures
access <strong>to information</strong>, was highly accepted among respondents
regarding health. Almost all of respondents said that they could get access to
health information and participate in the campaigns. In this regard, many
activities and group education about health have been undertaken to share
information, it also plays important role changing from the use of traditional
treatment like superstitious ways to scientifically medical treatment.
Regarding health campaign organizers, the respondents ranked SPREAD-NUR as the
leading provider of information, accounting 47% of all respondents for
campaigning followed Health center/Health post with 32% of all respondents,
Village health volunteer with 12%, and TV/Radio with 9% of all respondents.

provided the information. </p>
<p Align=justify>Dramas and Dances and education Group to houses, were
initiated by ABAHUZAMUGAMBI Cooperative under SPREAD-NUR. They stand for the
largest networking groups in disseminating training and health education. The
majority of respondents participated in them 62% in Education Group and 38% in
Dramas and dances. It is a good learning by direct involvement in the

and 6% of the sample viewed that health conditions has been  improved and now
they rate it to be good  and very good respectively in their respective
households. This finding suggests that 74% (68%+6%) of respondents is satisfied
with SPREAD-NUR's heath care activities and that health component of projects

with SPREAD in Chapter 4 and later on viewed the perceptions of the people. The
data showed that people are vastly empowered in the coffee production. </p>
<p Align=justify>The second objective described the understanding on
community's perception to SPREAD-NUR's contributions in development status of
rural area. The results are summarized as follows: 74% of the respondents
complained that they are satisfied with the quality of basic health that they
are enjoying. They also mentioned that their coffee plantations have been
ameliorated and that they expect high quantity and good quality in their
production. However, after SPREAD-NUR became involved in MARABA coffee
production, 97% of the sample viewed that the washing system has been improved.
In the same way, basic health and HIV/AIDS awareness have been improved. </p>
<p Align=justify>The third objective was to recommend measures and model of
empowerment to enhance the effectiveness of SPREAD-NUR in promoting rural
development in Rwanda. To fulfill this objective, the role of partners such as
SPREAD-NUR and targeted local population is in Chapter 4. The level of their
participation in rural development is high and active in regards to both
financing and coordinating projects toward rural development. Some operations
of SPREAD-NUR in MARABA also overlap with Local Government's operations but
they have prevented conflicts and/or transformed them into cooperation and
technical assistance for each other. They also came up with solutions for
exchanging opinions to facilitate and fill gaps in rural development in order
to serve the community together synergically. </p>
<p Align=justify>To conclude the study, this research discovers that SPREAD-NUR
is promoting Rural Development to an extent which covers six modules.
SPREAD-NUR has helped the community by empowering them to a degree of
satisfactory development perceived by the people. Overall, the people think
that SPREAD-NUR plays a very important role in enhancing their livelihood and
social welfare through its contribution in ameliorating coffee plantation and
production of ABAUZAMUGAMBI Cooperative Members, if compared to the past.
MARABA Coffee Producers are being organized and decentralized, food is secure
due to the income from coffee which permit them to provide with other kind of
good and when food is not enough in their households income from coffee is
used, more jobs and income are being generated, natural resources are
preserved, education is improved, health conditions and services are
strengthened, and the people are better prepared for selfe-sufficient. </p>
<p Align=justify>Next, local authorities also play vital roles as catalysts in
cooperation and facilitation in SPREAD-NUR's operation in this rural area. Last
but not least, empowerment has well promoted rural development by adequate
responds in terms of empowerment's indicators: access to information, inclusion
and participation in activities, accountability, and local organizational
capacity in the project's elements. </p>

<p Align=justify>In the context of the SPREAD-NUR, even though the approach is
promoting Rural Development, there are some gaps within SPREAD-NUR's coverage.
They are at the level of the participation of targeted population in activities
towards rural development lanced by SPREAD-NUR, and of updates to information
and accountability from actors in the development sector. Taking into
consideration findings of this research and to cope with gaps revealed
following the survey, these recommendations are offered in order to concentrate
the SPREAD-NUR's policies for Rural development:</p>
<p Align=justify>&#183; Education and training need to be placed at the
forefront of the rural development agenda in order to fight the evident extreme
poverty and hunger in rural areas; to break the poverty induced poverty result
cycle of rural life; to ensure sustainable agriculture, and to build the human
capacity needed for development.</p>
<p Align=justify>&#183; National University of Rwanda should enact and apply
strict valuable interest for rural development, and encourage Rural people to
cooperate friendly in programs for development.</p>
<p Align=justify>&#183; SPREAD-NUR should show its caring interest in the poor
by providing helpful project to the poor as soon as they require it.</p>
<p Align=justify>&#183; The ABAHUZAMUGAMBI Cooperative Member should work
closely with SPREAD-NUR for periodic surveys on perception towards rural
development.</p>
<p Align=justify>After that they have been developed, the researcher is
confident that these practices will be useful for NUR through its implication
in rural development and for rural communities inside and outside where NUR
operates. Before putting these kinds of policies into practice, unique and
potential aspects of local communities will always need to be studied in-depth
to fit with their environmental and needs in the future. Also, SPREAD-NUR's
project and management capacity are crucial to carrying out such an approach.
Consequently the most important experience from SPREAD-NUR's partnership is
that rural people should have both the commitment and will to promote a
self-sustaining community through the principles of self-help, self-control,
and self-organization.</p>
