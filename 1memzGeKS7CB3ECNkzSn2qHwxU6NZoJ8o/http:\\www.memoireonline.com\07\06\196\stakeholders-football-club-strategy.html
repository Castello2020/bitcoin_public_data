<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc0"></A>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </h1>

<p Align=left>This research aimed at defining who the most important
stakeholders considered by football clubs are and to know how they affect their
strategy. Emphasis is also made on how football clubs communicate and manage
their stakeholders. To answer these objectives, a case study approach was used.
Interviews were conducted with top managers of four professional football
clubs: Liverpool F.C., Stoke City F.C. (for England), R.C. Lens and Amiens S.C.
(for France). The data gathered also allowed the author to test stakeholding
models: Polonsky (1995), Archer (1995) and Mendelow's ones (1991). This
dissertation gives a detailed analysis of thirteen stakeholders' categories and
especially of fans, shareholders and media, which are the most important
stakeholders for football clubs. Tools and organizations developed by these
four clubs to communicate with stakeholders are also part of this research. The
last part analyses the differences between French and British football clubs;
and discuss ways to compensate them. </p>

<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc4"></A>1. INTRODUCTION </h1>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc5"></A>1.1. The current context </h2>

<p Align=left>There are so many football matches on television that people who
like this sport can watch a game almost every night. Football entertains
people, helps television channels to make large audiences, makes sportsmen
becoming pop idols and manages huge amounts of money. This looks as a very
lucrative business where every actor earns an important amount of money: clubs
selling players, players earning important wages, players' agents getting their
royalties... </p>
<p Align=left>The idea of this subject is very personal to the author. The
author aims at work in football clubs, so his interest for this activity sector
lasts since many years. This basic knowledge is essential to conduct an
efficient research, because football is a very specific business sector. Like
many other businesses, football clubs are owned by shareholders and run by
employees skilled in sales, marketing, communication, human resources and
finance... These departments exist in football clubs as well as in traditional
companies. Clubs also manage retailing of their products to the fans. But their
main activity is to produce a football game every weekend. According to that
specificity, to manage a football club can be compared with managing a
show-producing company. In fact, the most important element of the business is
what happens on the pitch every weekend. If the team wins, sales will increase
and sponsors will invest more money on the club but if the team looses, less
money will be available for the club. As players' price depends on their
performances, a team with little money should not be able to buy the good
players and so, could not compete with the richest ones. Apart some sportive
exceptions, clubs are engaged in an economic circle, whether vicious or
virtuous. </p>
<p Align=left>As football concerns and interests so many people, politics and
companies, communication about it is very careful: apart from the sport news
and players interviews, few people know how the crisis in football clubs is
important. Thanks to lower incomes (due to lower television rights), and to
increase expenses (especially players' wages), almost every clubs in Europe are
about to bankrupt. Shareholders have to invest always more money if they do not
want their football team to shut down. This concerns the most important clubs

French and English ones are not exceptions. We can notice that Manchester
United is THE exception and that this club makes profits every year and they
are successful on the pitch as well. Is there any link between profits and
sport success? One thing is sure it is that Manchester United is one of the
rare clubs who implemented a clear long-term strategy. Do the other clubs have
no strategy? Hopefully they must have one, but most of them bet on a short-term
and lucrative victory, rather than a long-term success. Football clubs'
managers have long-term view as well, but they have to cope and satisfy the
club's stakeholders. Fans and media want good and expensive players to `play
the show', shareholders want a return on investment, and institutions want the
club's commitment to develop and train young players... Unions (players,
employees, coaches) also have a certain control on this business. A club has to
take in account all those expectations when designing a strategy. The best
example of this critical situation is the transfer of the Brazilian player
named Ronaldhino from Paris Saint-Germain to F.C. Barcelona during summer 2003.
This player played for Paris and was so talented that the richest clubs of
Europe wanted to buy him. Paris SG's president did not want to sell him because
fans and the coach put pressure on him and to keep Ronaldhino would have
improve the team's efficiency for the following football season. This willing
may have been sincere but the transfer of the player happened anyway. The
reason of this event is the pressure put on the president by stakeholders to
sell the player. First, the player wanted to leave the club because of the
higher wages offered by clubs like F.C. Barcelona, Real Madrid or Manchester
United and his agent wanted him to move in order to improve his football
skills... or maybe to get enormous royalties on the new contract. Then, banks
and the Ligue de Football Professionel wanted PSG to decrease its financial
debt. PSG bought this player two years before and a sponsor (SportFive) helped
the club to pay the fees, charging it with a very high interest rate. So, this
sponsor was expecting its money back, as soon as the players' transfer would
have been signed. This case is a perfect example of how clubs can be influenced
by stakeholders and take decisions they did not wish to. This research analyses
this influence and tries to highlight some successful stakeholders managing
methods. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy7.png" alt=""></p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc6"></A>1.2. Objectives of the research </h2>

<p Align=justify>The first objective of this study is to find out who are the
most important stakeholders' groups considered by clubs. Polonsky's model is a
good base for this point. Then, it is interesting to know how those
stakeholders influence the clubs' strategies and to reveal from where their
power comes from. Another aim will be to analyse how clubs currently manage
their stakeholders. A comparison between English and French clubs will be drawn
as well as between important and less important ones. The last step will be an
adaptation of Polonsky's model to summarise the football situation graphically.
</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc7"></A>1.3. Research outline </h2>

<p Align=justify>The first part of this study consists of reviewing the
literature dealing with stakeholders. Mendelow, Archer and Polonsky developed
interesting theories about this subject and are used as theoretical basis of
this research. The practical part of this study uses secondary data from
articles, books and magazines, as well as primary data collected through
interviews with four football clubs' managers (Liverpool F.C., Stoke City F.C.,
R.C. Lens and Amiens S.C.). The data were analysed, compared, theories have
been used to design stakeholders maps, and Polonsky's model (1995) was then
adapted to football sector. </p>

<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc8"></A>2 - LITERATURE REVIEW </h1>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc9"></A>2.1. Stakeholder concept </h2>

<p Align=left>The stakeholder concept appeared on the first time in a Stanford
Research Institute memorandum written by Freeman (1984). This concept
symbolizes &#171;any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the
achievement of the organization's objectives&#187;. But this concept has been
developed by Donaldson and Preston (1991), who suggested that &#171;the
organization should consider a wider range of influencers when developing its
strategy&#187; and that &#171;earlier theories of the firm do not consider all
of the &#171;groups&#187; that influence organizational activities&#187;. </p>
<p Align=left>In theory, the concept of stakeholders is infinite. It includes
so many individuals and groups that Freeman (1984) drew a limit, useful to
researches by regrouping the most important and interesting stakeholders
groups: </p>

<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc10"></A>2. 2. Stakeholder theory </h2>

<p Align=left>This theory developed by Donaldson and Preston (1991) is wide and
advise the firms that they should balance all stakeholders' objectives when
designing a new strategy. It affirms that giving equal importance to
stakeholders is the best way to achieve a company's success, not only to
concentrate on financial outcomes. These authors think that the best way is to
give as much fulfilment as possible to all stakeholders without exception. It
is essential, for example, to delight customers, to motivate employees, to
build long lasting relationship with suppliers... </p>

<p Align=left>It is a very complicate task, so challenging, because it is
obvious that shareholders expecting return on investment will not appreciate
expenses for new facilities for employees. All stakeholders' objectives cannot
be met, just a part of it. To achieve that, the company has to balance its own
objectives as well, because achieving its objectives may have the cost of
leaving a stakeholder behind. </p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc11"></A>2.3. Stakeholder mapping </h2>

<p Align=left>This technique allows organizations to draw a map of their
stakeholders, so that they get a better view of their environment, so it helps
them to put in place a new strategy. Two schemes, looking similar although
different, will be useful to this research. First will be explained the
Mendelow (1991) one and then, the Archer (1995) one. Mendelow (1991) one is
more useful to have a look at the situation, whereas Archer tries to offer help
to design strategies. </p>

<p Align=center>Key Players </p>
<p Align=justify>According to Mendelow (1991), most of companies' efforts have
to be focused on segment D, called &#171;key players&#187;. Organizations
cannot deal without them. Segment B represents stakeholders to keep informed,
but not to underestimate because those groups can be really useful for
supporting any lobbying action. To keep satisfy the C category is also
something not to forget about. Mendelow insists that stakeholders can move from
a category to another, so they can easily switch to the D category, which would
mean that they could frustrate the adoption of a new strategy. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy10.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>Mendelow is the first author who highlighted that stakeholders
move from categories, so managers have to keep aware about any change. The
question is also asked to know if managers try to satisfy stakeholders
depending on their category, or if they are manipulating those stakeholders
group, shifting one from a category to another, to implement a new strategy.
</p>
<p Align=left>This mapping tool allows companies to be aware of the following
issues: -The company can now understand if its current strategy is still in
adequation with stakeholders' interests and power. -To identify who will be the
support of your project, and who has the ability and aim to stop it. -The
company can then try to give less importance to some groups and try to
reposition some as well. This is a very political approach. -To encourage
stakeholders to stay in their proper category, or to avoid them to shifting to
another category. Any change not wanted by the organisation implies a new
strategy to put in place. Others issues are also highlighted by the author.
First, stakeholders groups usually contain many subgroups with different
objectives, so it confuses this mapping technique. Moreover, organizations have
to know who the leaders of stakeholders' groups are and what their objectives
are, so that they know who they should contact depending on the circumstances.

<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>Archer's model (1995), useful to draw a map of the stakeholders
influence, is based on two things: the fact that stakeholders have compatible
or incompatible interests and aims; and whether they are necessary to the
organisation or just external contingent relations. As you can see, each
category is given an adjective to describe its behaviour, and Archer also
proposes a solution or strategy to adopt with the group concerned. </p>
<p Align=left>-<u>Group A: </u>Necessary and compatible. This situation happens
when stakeholders and the organization are really linked to each other. Both
have something to loose if the relationship disrupt. So, it is logical that the
organisation defends this precious link and has protectionist behaviour towards
this category. </p>
<p Align=left>-<u>Group B: </u>Contingent and compatible. Here, the
organization has to make a choice. It is in front of a stakeholders group which
has the same aims and interests, but which is not necessary to the business. It
may represent a good business opportunity but does the company want to
integrate this stakeholder in its environment or is the organization too
conservative? A choice has to be made. </p>
<p Align=left>-<u>Group C: </u>Contingent and incompatible. Archer refers to
war as an extreme case of this category. The organization has not a direct
competition with this category, but the indirect competition is about getting
support of powerful stakeholders. So, the competition is on and the more damage
the other organisation gets and the more influent people join yours. The
organization's aim is to discredit oppositional views and accentuate
differences. </p>
<p Align=left>-<u>Group D: </u>Necessary and incompatible. This is an
unpleasant situation where the organization has to cope with stakeholders who
do not have the same interest. So, in this type of relationship, one of the
parties will be threatened. Both have to agree on a compromise, but none of
them will be totally satisfied. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy12.png" alt=""></p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc13"></A>2.4. Stakeholders' management - Polonsky's model </h2>

<p Align=center><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy13.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=justify>According to Polonsky's model (1995) above, stakeholders not
only have a stake in the organizational behaviour but they are also linked to
each other. To make the figure easiest to read, all the links between
stakeholders are not shown, but they are implied. Any group may have
connections with each other group. It is based on Freeman (1984) stakeholders'
selection, as it keeps the same twelve important groups. </p>
<p Align=justify>According to Polonsky, there is a four-step-management-process
to integrate the stakeholders in the strategy developing process: </p>
<p Align=left>1 Identify the relevant stakeholder groups. </p>
<p Align=left>2 Determine the stake and importance of each stakeholder group.
</p>
<p Align=left>1 Determine how effectively the &#171;needs&#187; or
&#171;expectations&#187; of each group is being met. </p>
<p Align=left>2 Modify corporate policies and priorities to take into
consideration stakeholder interests. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy14.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left><u>Stage 1: </u>stakeholder identification The organization has
to draw a stakeholder map (Mendelow and Archer's models will be useful for this
task!). If you analyse stakeholders for a specific issue, then the map may
differ from the one you drawn just before. Maps also changes with stakeholders
repositioning and depends on stakeholders' relationship between them as well.
To determine which stakeholder groups are relevant, the author suggests the
organization to consider how they relate to the strategy implementation. If the
group may influence the firm's strategy, it is a relevant one. The organization
has to be sure that its analysis considers the key factors to its strategy. </p>
<p Align=left><u>Stage 2: </u>determining the stakes Managers must determine
each stockholder's stake; this is a very difficult task. These groups have
different effects on different part of the organization, and do not perceive
the organization's behaviour the same way. Sometimes interactions between
stakeholders may be more important than their direct effect on the firm. An
accurate determination of stakes is an essential step of the strategy
development project. According to Freeman (1984), each stakeholder can
potentially have a positive or negative influence on the organization, that's
why it is very important for the firm to forecast the stakeholders'
expectations evolution. There is no clear method to determine these stakes but
direct communication with those groups allows the organization to have an
unbiased feedback about how it is perceived. Unfortunately, organizations are
sometimes in unfavourable terms with some stakeholders. A good understanding of
the stakes and potential of each stakeholder's group may have on the firm a
valuable effect on the development of an optimal strategy. </p>
<p Align=left><u>Stage 3: </u>Determine how well expectations are met Once the
stakeholders' expectations are determined (cf. stage 2), the organization has
to know if these hopes are met with the current strategy. It is also a
difficult task because some objective can be concrete and measurable, but it is
easy to analyse if an effort has been put in place to improve this kind of
issue. But some stakeholders' groups have subjective aims, so the organization
must understand them as clearly as possible. If there is no good understanding
about an issue, both stakeholders and organization will view each other as an
adversary. Usually, managers realize the gap between its strategy and
stakeholders' expectations after a clash, a strike... Polonsky (1995) suggests
that the organization continually conducts social audits; without it, it would
be difficult to </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy15.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>minimize gaps. Moreover, these audits will be used as a
monitoring tool in the time, because a satisfied unimportant stakeholder of
today may be an unsatisfied and important one in the future. This cannot be
determined without those social audits. Direct communication is, again, the
most effective way to socialize stakeholders into the organization. According
to Polonsky (1995), the lack of communication often distorts the manager's
interpretations of the stakeholders' expectations as well as the stakeholders'
understanding of organizational behaviour. </p>
<p Align=left><u>Stage 4: </u>Adjusting the organization's strategy After
managers determined how well stakeholders' expectations are being met by the
current strategy, they have to adapt and reformulate their corporate strategy
(most of times, strategy is not adapted enough to stakeholders). This strategy
has to integrate competing expectations with organizational priorities. So, it
is improbable that the new strategy meets all expectations at once. In these
cases, Polonsky (1995) suggests that managers develop programs or contingency
plans for potential problems that may arise in the future. The problem for
managers is now to decide which stakeholders' expectations will and will not be
met. The information collected in the precedent stages is the best tool to make
this difficult but necessary decision. An alternative solution is that the
organization and stakeholders' groups interaction may change groups'
expectations, but it is unlikely that all groups change their objectives and
agree with the new strategy. What usually happens is that the firm will modify
its strategy and the stakeholders modify their expectations, so that the gap
between performance and expectations is reduced. Gaps still remain and it is
the managers' role to reduce the potential for negative stakeholders'
expectations and to increase the probability of positive reactions. The key
method is, again, to do this through socialization of stakeholders into the
organization so that they will have a better understand of the organizational
objectives and therefore they should be less problematic. </p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc14"></A>2.5. Objectives of the research </h2>

<p Align=left>Polonky's model (1995) is very useful to achieve goals because it
is divided into many parts (or steps). These different parts may represent the
different objectives of the research. The overall objective of the research is
to know how stakeholders influence football clubs' strategies. The second aim
is to draw a comparison between France and England, and </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy16.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>between important and less important teams. So the different
objectives of this researchare:-Which stakeholders are considered important by
football clubs?-Do those stakeholders have any power on the club? Where does
their power come from?-How do they influence the clubs' strategies?-How the
football clubs manage and communicate with stakeholders?-Have the French and
English clubs similar or different way to manage stakeholders? Arethose
differences expanding or not?First, a stakeholder map has to be drawn (with
Archer (1995) and Mendelow's (1991)models). Then, the author will try to answer
every objective and to apply Polonsky's modelto the football sector. Answers to
this problematic will come from the data gatheredthrough the following
methodology.</p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy17.png" alt=""></p>


<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc15"></A>3 - RESEARCH METHODOLOGY </h1>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc16"></A>3.1. Information required for the research </h2>

<p Align=left>According to the objectives listed in part 2.5., the information
required was important to find which stakeholders were considered important to
the football clubs, what nature of power they had on the club, how did it
affect the clubs' strategy, how did the clubs manage those stakeholders and if
there were differences in managing stakeholders between important and less
important clubs, also between French and English ones. It is essential to
define an `important' football club. A football club is considered to be
important by analysts and journalists if it has finished the league ranked in
the five first teams for the past three (or four) years. So these teams are
supposed to have more employees than others and to be better organised. A less
important club was, for this study, a club which evolved in second division
(Division One in England) but did not access to the elite or regress to a lower
division for the last three or four years. This definition is relevant for both
French and English leagues. This research had to take in account studies about
football clubs' management made by universities (mostly from Liverpool and
Leicester ones), articles in the specialized magazines (France Football and
442), reports on the football market (Mintel and Emerald) and football clubs'
annual reports. This information gave an overview of the football business but
nothing concrete on the stakeholders' management. The most important resources
came from French and English football clubs themselves, so primary data had to
come from interviews conducted with football clubs' managers. Then, Archer's
model (1995) and Polonski's one (1995) were applied and adapted to the football
sector, thanks to the data collected. </p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc17"></A>3.2. Research approach </h2>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc18"></A>3.2.1. Inductive or deductive approach? </h3>

<p Align=left>According to Saunders (2002), the deductive approach needs a high
quantity of quantitative data for the researcher to be able to generalise its
results. So with this approach based on scientific principles, an important
sample has to be used. This is the main reason </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy18.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>why this approach was not used during this research. In fact,
England has about ninety-six professional football clubs and in France only
thirty-six exist. Taking in account that the average response rate for a
questionnaire is rarely over ten percent, this research would have been based
on eleven answers maximum. Everyone agree that this is not enough for an
efficient research using the deductive approach. The inductive approach seemed
more adapted to this study. Still according to Saunders (2002), this type of
approach is based on qualitative data and a close understanding of the research
context. The need to generalise the results is not compulsory. Concerning
football clubs, it is difficult to understand the context and to answer the
research question only with questionnaires. It is a complex and permanently
changing sector where each club is managed its way and evolutes in a different
environment. So, an inductive approach using qualitative data seemed the only
way to understand football clubs'stakeholders' influence. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc19"></A>3.2.2. Research philosophy </h3>

<p Align=left>Concerning the philosophy used for this research the choice has
not been made between the `traditional' positivism and phenomenology. In fact,
those two approaches did not meet the requirements of this study. Positivism,
although it would have been helpful to test Polonsky's model (1995), needs
large samples, which like the deductive approach, is not possible with football
clubs because they are not numerous enough. Phenomenology implies that the
researcher is involved and generates theories. Although an adaptation of
Polonsky (1995) and Archer's (1995) models was made by the author, this
approach is not adapted to this study requirement. Another approach is called
`realism' and was used for this study (Easterby-Smith and al., 2001). Realism
is a way to conduct an analysis based on facts. This approach was more adapted
to this research which happened in a changing environment. To base this study
on economical reality of professional football clubs was the most reliable way
to conduct this research. To test the three models presented in the second part
of this research, evidences had to be found in the economic reality, that's why
a case study approach was used. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy19.png" alt=""></p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc20"></A>3.2.3. A case study approach </h3>

<p Align=left>According to Yin (1994), the case study approach is useful to
investigate a modern phenomenon in its real context. This definition
corresponds to this research, which aim was to study how football clubs managed
stakeholders. To study few football clubs was the best option. The author did
not have time enough to study every single football club. As football clubs are
very different, to study only one case would not have been pertinent for the
research. As said in part 3.1., it was interesting to analyse the management of
important and less important football clubs, as well as English and French
ones. Thanks to the data gathered, it was possible to design a close-to-reality
stakeholders' mapping. Archer's model (1995) needed current data, as
stakeholders' position and influence evolutes in time. Polonsky's model (1995)
is less affected by time; nevertheless it has to be adapted depending on
football clubs' reality. All cases were studied similarly. The same methods
were used to analyse each type of club, which was the only way to highlight
differences between clubs' category (cf. research protocol part 3.5.1.). A
multi-method approach was used for this study, analysing statistics, financial,
legal and social data. The use different type of data was required to have an
overview of all stakeholders' management. Data from football clubs were
comparable because, whether in France or England, clubs are into the same
business type (e.g. accounts includes players transfer, high salary...).
Moreover, Europeanization of the football business is increasing (e.g. creation
of the interests group called G14). </p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc21"></A>3.3. Data collection </h2>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc22"></A>3.3.1. Secondary data </h3>

<p Align=left>To have an overview of football clubs' sector, it has been useful
to integrate an important amount of secondary data. Both types of data were
used: qualitative and quantitative. The aim of this secondary data study was to
design football clubs' portraits to be able to conduct in-depth interviews
later on. The clubs' official documents (e.g. annual reports) were ordered by
e-mail, through the football clubs' websites. Clubs are used to answer students
request so they sent those </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy20.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September

<p Align=left>information very quickly, in England. As they are considered as
traditional companies, English clubs have to publish their financial accounts.
In France, clubs did not have to publish their accounts (but things are
changing), so it was impossible to get them, even by asking the clubs. Clubs
websites were full of information and freely accessible. On these sites you
could find information for fans, downloadable documents, managers' interview,
players' interview... Leagues official reports have been the most useful
secondary data: they give an overview of the sector, forecasts for the future
of the business... They were accessible on demand by e-mail through the Premier
League, the Football Association and the Ligue de Football Professionel's
websites. The websites of stakeholders' groups were also analysed (G14,
players' association, agents...). It was also possible to find some academic
papers written by lecturers or students on universities websites. Most of them
were available on-line. They were really precise and useful to understand
football clubs' management and economy. The most recommendable universities
were Liverpool and Leicester ones because they had football studies
departments. Some other papers deal with the subject on the Internet. Emerald
and Mintel websites have been the most useful tools to gather documentary data.
Many books were edited about football business and football economics, but
their content was not useful for this study. In fact, most of the popular books
were focused on some polemic events and did not study deeply football clubs'
management. The only useful books were the ones written by academicians and
lecturers. A huge amount of (useful and useless) information came from
specialised magazines like 442 or France Football, daily newspapers, television
and radio. In fact, they often related speech of football clubs' managers,
players and sometimes of agents. It has been meaningful to feel the atmosphere
and the trend of football economics. All those secondary data have allowed the
author to have an overview of the current football business and to get some
clues about how were managed stakeholders by football clubs. The decisive part
of this research depended on the primary data collection. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy21.png" alt=""></p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc23"></A>3.3.2. Primary data </h3>

<p Align=left>This information has been the core of this research. Primary data
came directly from football clubs' managers. It was important to select an
interview mode. A telephone interview would have been the quickest way to get
this data but it was also limited in time. People usually are not at ease with
long conversation on the phone, so they prefer to shorter the interview. To
understand stakeholders' management, an interview on the phone would not have
been long and `deep' enough. Liverpool F.C. asked the author to design an
e-mail interview, before they changed their mind and accepted to meet the
interviewer. Face-to-face interview was the mean chosen to conduct this
research. It was the most adapted mode to understand how the club is managed,
to have time enough to answer all the questions and to have spontaneous (and
usually true) answers. Then, some football clubs had to be chosen as sample for
these in-depth and standardised interviews. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc24"></A>3.3.3. Sample selection </h3>

<p Align=left>To conduct face-to-face interview is costly, so the sample had to
be quite narrow but representative. This confirmed the case study approach. To
have a representative sample, important and less important clubs had to be
studied as well as French and English ones. So the simplest sample was to
select two French clubs (one important and one less important) added to two
English representatives. According to the budget needed, the geographically
closest clubs (from the author's home) were favoured, what Saunders (2002)
calls a convenience sample. Another element has been taken in account was the
availability of the managers. Some managers were too busy to meet students.
Stoke City F.C. and Liverpool F.C. were chosen as English representatives. They
had the characteristics required. Mr Fuller, managing director of Stoke City
F.C., was available. Mr Weathley, financial director of Liverpool F.C., was
difficult to convince but accepted to give an interview. Paris S.G. was first
chosen for the French part of the sample, but the president and most of the
club's staff has been fired at the end of May 2002. Because of this event, R.C.
Lens </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy22.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>was picked up with Amiens S.C. Mr Bigeard, marketing manager of
R.C. Lens and MrBuquet, president of Amiens S.C. welcomed this interview.A
sample of four clubs was the minimum to give a pertinent view of football
clubs'stakeholders' management and to compare French and English systems.</p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc25"></A>3.3.4. Interview preparation </h3>

<p Align=left>These four interviews were realized in a short period: between
April and July 2003. It was very important to conduct them at the same time to
catch the managers' methods at this moment. As football is a changing sector,
this way of collecting data made them comparable. It was important to prepare
some questions to guide the interviewees to answer this research's problematic.
Only open questions were asked in order to lead managers to develop their
answers. It was also required to learn the right vocabulary because these
interviews have been done in two different languages: English and French.
Thanks to the analysis of secondary data, the interviewer had a solid knowledge
about the situation in each club studied. The clubs had to talk about the
twelve stakeholders' groups retained by Polonsky (1995). The first question was
to ask who were considered as the three groups with most interest in the club.
Then, for each chosen group, the managers had to explain how they can influence
their club's strategy and where their source of power came from. Concrete
examples of this influence were also asked to illustrate the research and to
confirm this power on clubs. A last question was how and how often the club
communicate with those chosen groups. After the three most important
stakeholders' groups were studied, the same questions were asked about the nine
other stakeholders' groups. As face-to-face interviews are time consuming, the
explanation about these nine groups could not be as developed as the three main
groups have been. Then, these data were typed and analysed. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy23.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>3.4. Method for analysis </p>
<p Align=left>The data collected from the four interviews were analysed through
a reflection process. The basic theoretical framework came from Polonsky (1995)
and Archer's (1995) models which allowed the author to develop theories. Data
were used to answer the different objectives. An explanation approach has been
used to explain how football clubs managed their stakeholders. This approach is
linked to the case study method of analysis. To increase this study
reliability, primary data were compared to secondary data, to find chains of
evidence that justified what emerged from the interviews. The last step was to
compare the results between important and less important clubs from the same
county, then to compare similar clubs from different countries (France and
England). This method highlighted the differences between the clubs composing
the sample. This last step allowed the author to find some similar elements and
to evaluate if football management is converging or not between those two
countries. </p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc26"></A>3.5. Methodology review </h2>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc27"></A>3.5.1. Research protocol </h3>

<p Align=left>To collect data of the same type and to be able to compare it
efficiently, a research protocol was put in place by the interviewer. For each
club, top managers have been interviewed at their office, by the same
interviewer. Two of them were general managers, one was marketing manager and
the last one was financial director. Their function allowed them to answer
clearly each question because of the overview they had on the business. As the
same data were required from the clubs, the same questions were asked to the
four managers. This element of the protocol was essential. Moreover, for each
interview, a length of one hour was required by the interviewer. At least, the
data collected had all the same type, so the same analysis method was applied
to them. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy24.png" alt=""></p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc28"></A>3.5.2. Reliability of the data </h3>

<p Align=left>It was important to base this research on reliable data. Data
coming from the clubs were official ones: the annual reports were a legal
obligation for clubs, so they published their real accounts. The interviewees
were top managers of those clubs and are supposed to deliver true data. Mostly
based on official reports (from leagues and clubs) the data were also verified
using chains of evidence. The data from websites, articles and books, although
not official, allowed the researcher to check the statistics and information
given by the clubs. Articles from Emerald and Mintel reports were peer-reviewed
so they were considered reliable for the study. Everyone should be warned about
the lack of reliability of newspapers and radio concerning football. These
sources of information aimed at selling their information and were based on
rumours, scandals and polemics. The author would recommend keeping an attentive
attitude to the information they give to feel the atmosphere but not to use it
as reliable data. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc29"></A>3.5.3. Limits of the methodology </h3>

<p Align=left>The limits highlighted were due to the face-to-face interview.
First, it has been difficult to obtain those interviews. Football clubs'
managers (like every manager) were very busy and not always available. So it
was time-consuming to convince them. The second limit was due to the language:
as English was not the interviewer's mother tongue, some information may have
been misunderstood or forgotten. A face-to-face interview is also limited in
time: although the interviewer asked for one-hour-meeting, the interviews
lasted from forty-five minutes to one hour and a half depending on the
manager's availability. This length seems quite long at first sight, but all
the points could not be developed as wished. Another limit is that this
research is mostly based on those four interviews and it cannot represent a
general view of the football sector. Moreover, the data collected came from
football clubs and could have been biased by managers to give a better
impression of their club. That's why chains of evidence tried to be used as
often as possible. </p>

<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September

<p Align=left>In Liverpool F.C., the managing director was not available for an
interview so the interviewee was the financial director. Due to his function,
Mr Weathley had a complete knowledge about stakeholders linked with the club's
finance but less data about others stakeholders' groups. The last limit was
that French football clubs did not have to publish annual reports, so the
statistics for French football clubs analysis were not as detailed as for the
English ones. </p>

<p Align=center>4. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS<br></p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc30"></A>4.1. Overview of the results </h2>

<p Align=justify>The four managers interviewed answered every question and gave
the maximum information to the interviewee. French managers are not as sharp in
giving financial figures considering their clubs; moreover they do not have to
publish their accounts the way they do in England. So some financial figures
considering French clubs are missing. </p>
<p Align=justify>Here is a quick portrait of each club to situate them. Of
course, more details and figures will be given later in this study: </p>
<p Align=center><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy27.png" alt=""></p>

<p Align=right><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy29.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=center><em>Source: interviews conducted </em></p>
<p Align=left>The first important step in this study was to define who are the
stakeholders influencing football clubs' strategy. On the basis of Polonsky's
model (1995), the four managers discussed of the twelve groups the author
listed. It appeared that one group had no influence on clubs, so `Scientific
community' category was removed. According to them, the `General Public' has no
direct effect on clubs, although fans come from there. But a category is
already named `Fans', so `General </p>
<p Align=left>1. To get every figure in Sterling, the same exchange rate was
used for the study. This rate was &#163;1=1,6045?according to the Stock
Exchange market on August 13<sup>th </sup>, 2003. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy30.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>Public' should be removed.The other categories had to be renamed
to be clearer to the readers. So `Legal/Court'became `Organisations' which
apply rules to football clubs. Football club's `Consumers'are always called
`Fans'. The `Financial Institutions' are the `Banks'. Football
clubs'`Competitors' are the `Other Clubs'. Their `Owners' are `Shareholders'.
And footballclubs' `Suppliers' usually are `Sponsors', especially for strategic
supply, like equipments.Two categories were missing, and not the less important
in football, the `Players/Coaches'and the `Agents'. So they have been added to
the list. `Public Institutions' are usuallylinked to the clubs, so they can be
added.Here is the modified list of now thirteen stakeholders' groups. These
changes wererecommended by the four managers interviewed, to clarify which
stakeholders this studydeals with.</p>

<p Align=justify>According to the table 4.2., the most important stakeholders
considered by the clubs are fans. Then, the shareholders, employees, media and
the players arrive. These groups were the subject of most part of the
interviews, so they will be the most important points of this research. </p>

<p Align=left>A first interesting point is to highlight that no French clubs
consider the shareholders as important stakeholders because in France, clubs do
not have access to Stock Exchange market and so, do not belong to private
shareholders. </p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc31"></A>4.2. Stakeholders' expectations and influence </h2>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc32"></A>4.2.1. Fans </h3>

<p Align=left>In the traditional economy, customers expect, from an
organisation, a good quality product and service. It is the same for football
fans. They expect that the game they bought the ticket of will be a good show.
They want to appreciate a good football game with its special stadium
atmosphere. For this experience to be comfortable, fans expect that clubs offer
them all the equipments required in stadium. Like affirms Michie (2001), fans
do not care about the size of the net profits of the club they support. But
football fans have an emotional link with `their' team, a kind of
identification. Their first expectation is the team to win. So they want the
best players to play for their team and they always put pressure on clubs to
buy them. But as good players are rare, their price is really high and football
clubs have to invest a lot of money on the pitch if they want their fans to be
satisfied. </p>
<p Align=left>Clubs agree that fans are essential for them and that they affect
their strategy, that's why they are considered as very important stakeholders.
But where does this consideration come from? Every manager will highlight that
their everyday moral and psychological support is a necessary contribution and
a key element in the team success. It is difficult to measure how the crowd can
influence the team success but there is no doubt that this physical support is
important on match day. But fans also represent an important part of clubs'
income. </p>

<p Align=right><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy44.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=center><em>Source: Mintel (2002) </em></p>
<p Align=left>Fans represent a commercial opportunity: they pay to attend
games, they buy the clubs' merchandise in clubs' shop and they also pay for a
visit of the clubs' museum or a stadium tour when they exist. It may not sound
very impressive but it represents thirty percent of Liverpool F.C.'s income.
Clubs have to take in account fans expectations, as they cannot manage without
the income they correspond to. Michie (2001) developed the idea that fans are
essential to football clubs because they stand at both sides of the value
process in football clubs. They are final customers of the games but they also
contribute to create an atmosphere in the stadium, which will be consumed by
fans in the stadium and those watching television or listening to the radio.
Fans are `producing' a part of football clubs' product. What would be the
commercial impact of teams playing in empty stadiums? This problem will not
happen soon. For example, Liverpool F.C. has set up a waiting list for its
season tickets and it is already booked for the next three years! As fans'
expectation is the team to win, every two weeks when their team plays at home,
they give their opinion about the clubs' management. Inside the stadium or at
the training camp, fans can put physical pressure on players or coaches they do
not considered as good enough. Sometimes, this pressure becomes violent and
ends to people's aggression. </p>
<p Align=left>To increase their influence on clubs' management, fans regroup
themselves in fans' groups, which have represents when they have to deal with
clubs. So these represents have even more power because they have the support
of thousands of fans. For example, R.C. Lens' managers often have to deal with
the largest fans' organisation in France. About 9,000 fans are members of this
group. Would any club like to frustrate such a numerous part of their fans? </p>
<p Align=justify>2: N.A.: not available </p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>Concerning England, fans' organisations are managed a different
way and are encouraged by the Premier League itself through the `Supporter
Trust' program. In England, fans can also become shareholders of the club by
buying shares. This program was developed to encourage supporters to unify
enough shares to send one of them to attend clubs' annual meetings. The extreme
examples of these Trusts' power are the A.F.C. Bournemouth and Northampton Town
F.C. which are clubs now managed by a chief executive emerged from fans. These
clubs' fans owned such an important part of their capital that they were in
charge of appointing a new chief executive, as reported Smith (2000). Fans are
also part of the image of the clubs. Everyone can remember the eighties and the
incredible numbers of hooligans in British stadium. This kind of negative and
violent image can put clubs in difficult position with their other
stakeholders. Fans can also have another negative aspect: they can affect the
clubs' business. The Sir Norman Chester Centre (2002) reports that BskyB tried
to buy Manchester United and the clubs managers agreed with that, but fans put
pressure on the club and government to avoid this bid. At the end, BskyB was
not allowed to buy the club's financial capital. This event is often reported
as a major success for fans. Clubs try to manage this crowd as efficiently as
possible, to develop a commercial potential. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc33"></A>4.2.2. Shareholders </h3>

<p Align=left>Shareholders were considered important only by British clubs
during this study. To explain that is very easy: in France, football clubs are
not allowed to access private funds through Stock Exchange market. The
government forbid it. Shareholders often seek return on investment when they
invest their money. This is also true concerning football, like highlighted
Michie (2001), but it is not compulsory. Football clubs shareholders often
invest in football to benefit from its media exposition or to get advantages
like access to games, meetings with players. For example, Granada TV owns ten
percent of Liverpool F.C. because there is an efficient synergy between this
sport and television. Liverpool F.C.'s chairman, who owns fifty-one percent of
the club, is said not to be interested by return on investment. Passion drove
him to invest in the club. It is real because Liverpool F.C. has never paid any
dividend to its shareholders. Feelings have to be </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy45.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>part of this investment because it is not a rational one: the
value of most English clubs has halved in recent years, according to the Sir
Norman Chester Centre (2002). It is also written in the same study that
football clubs, like each Plc., may not seek return on investment but must
endeavour to generate their satisfaction. Their source of power is obvious:
they own the club! When English football clubs entered the Stock Exchange
market, most of the owners kept a majority of shares. Only Manchester United
was fully sold on the market. At Liverpool F.C., Mr Moore is the chairman of
the club, with its 17,923 shares, about fifty-one percent of the club.
Considering that a share price is about &#163;4,000, it is understandable that
his power on the club's management is important. That's why he is also
president of the club. With this function, he can set the strategy of the club
and appoint the key employees. Charismatic shareholders also uses of personal
connections for the benefit of their clubs. This is an example of an internal
stakeholder who runs the club. But Liverpool F.C. is composed of 34,000 shares
which belong to 1,500 different shareholders; some are external to the club.
This is a major challenge for a football club because these shareholders attend
to the annual general meetings; they discuss the club decisions and influence
the club's strategy. It is really important for the clubs that shareholders
agree with the strategy proposed, otherwise they will have to negotiate. As
British football clubs are Plc.'s, they can be targets of financial bid to
control them. It happened in Stoke City F.C., when an Icelandic group took over
the club and appointed the first overseas manager in the club history: Gudjon
Thordarson. It also important to remember again the bid of supporters Trusts
who now control AFC Bournemouth and Northampton Town FC. In July 2003, Roman
Abramovitch bought Chelsea F.C. for &#163;26.8 million. This ex-manager of
Russian oil companies is now president of one of the most important English
club. Juventus Turin also sold 7,5 percent of the club to Saadi Kadhafi, son of
the Syrian Colonel, according to Attal (2003). He is now a professional player
in the Italian League. Those two people bought shares at an interesting price
for past shareholders and increased their power over these clubs. Take-overs
have to be considered as a danger by clubs. Who would like to see its club
owned by a Russian linked with the Mafia or the son of a terrorist dictator?
Clubs have to be aware of these dangers and should try to manage their current
shareholders to avoid any problem. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy46.png" alt=""></p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc34"></A>4.2.3. Employees </h3>

<p Align=left>In companies, employees expect to be paid at the end of the
month, to get work satisfaction and recognition, to be trained and have good
working conditions. It is the same in football clubs. But there is another
expectation which comes from the sportive aspect of their employer. They expect
the team to win, so that they feel part of the success. It is not only a
question of pride, but also of budget: when the team wins, clubs get more
income and is able to invest in training or commodities for their employees.
</p>
<p Align=left>The power of the employees comes from many sources. First, they
are the working force of clubs and they run the day to day business. If
employees' expectations are not met, their productivity will decrease because
of lack of motivation. Football cubs are managed like teams and if an element
of the team fails, the whole team fails. If employees do not work efficiently
anymore, the working conditions of the players will be worse; the merchandising
sales will decrease... It is the same situation than in any traditional
company. Extreme cases are strikes. Although France is worldwide famous for its
strikes, none have ever been reported concerning football clubs. Nevertheless,
it is a threat managers have to deal with. According to Mr Bigeard, the 240
employees of R.C. Lens have to be in harmony with the clubs, they are an
essential part of clubs' success. The power of employees has official
represents in France with the SNAAF, which is football clubs' employees union.
This union puts pressure on the Ligue de Football Professionnel to always
increase minimum wages. In France, football clubs employees are ruled by
special convention and earn substantially more money than in any other private
company. The British system is much more liberal and, although unions exist,
their power is very limited. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc35"></A>4.2.4. Players and Coaches </h3>

<p Align=left>This stakeholder category exists only in sports clubs. It is a
particularity. Players and coaches are employees of the clubs and so have
similar expectations: to get paid for their work, to be trained and to have
good working conditions. The most important expectation is sportive success. In
players and coaches' contracts financial bonuses are often related to success
(when the team wins); it means that their salary increases. Players also expect
to play in a notorious club to become popular and to integrate their national
squad. They also expect to play for / to coach the best clubs of the world.
Currently, every player / coach wishes to integrate Manchester United or Real
Madrid, to win competitions. Since the Bosman rule<sup>3 </sup>is applied in
Europe, players attached to their clubs are exceptions. It is more and more
difficult for clubs to keep their best players. Moreover, as players cost an
important amount of money (Zidane was sold by Juventus Turin to Real Madrid for
&#163;50 million), they are an entire part of the club's capital. Clubs also
expect to increase their income by selling their players at an interesting
price. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy47.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>The power of the coaches and players on their club has almost no
limit. They are the key to success through their performance on the pitch.
Sport has always been unpredictable, but players working in bad conditions or
not in harmony with the club lead the club to a sportive (and so financial)
disaster. They also cost between fifty and seventy percent of clubs' total
expenses! Players are also the image of the club. By their behaviour on the
pitch, their results, their relationship with sponsors and fans, their
interviews, they create clubs' image. So, who would like to be criticized on
television by its own players / coach? It is delicate to control players,
moreover that they are now considered like pop stars. Players are even stronger
because most of them are members of unions (The PFA in England and the UNFP in
France). These unions' influence is mostly based on wages: they set up generous
minimum wages and clubs are not allowed to avoid this bottom line. This is true
for important football stars as well as for young players signing their first
contract. The unions are always aware of the television deals between clubs and
the League, to put pressure and increase again the players' wages. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc36"></A>4.2.5. Media </h3>

<p Align=justify>Media have to be considered in two parts: the media industry
which invests money in football, show games, and the other part which is the
press and newspapers. </p>
<p Align=justify>3: The Bosman rule allow any player of European nationality to
play for any club in Europe, as anyone is allowed to work for any company in
any country within the E.U. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy48.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>The media industry's main expectation is to make important
audiences when showing games, which means to make financial profits. To achieve
that, they expect that clubs will make efforts to produce games pleasant to
watch, with competitive teams. The show has to be so attractive that people
will pay to watch those games (pay-per-view system). Media also expect clubs to
attract the most popular players and to `clean' the stadium from any violence
or racism. Clubs have to develop a positive and `easy-to-sell' image. The other
part of the media (the press) does not have the same expectations. Of course,
the more popular football is and the more papers they will sell but the main
expectation is to get original information. It does not mean to get official
information from the club but information that would increase the sales. Press
also needs football clubs news to fulfil some pages in everyday newspapers. </p>
<p Align=left>The media industry's power in football is major. First, this
industry worked hard to improve the football image. According to British
football clubs' managers, BskyB helped clubs to improve their structures, to
get rid of violence and to improve British football's image so that it now
attracts foreign players. BskyB also marketed the British football worldwide,
which helped the clubs to develop commercial programs abroad (especially in
Asia). Mr Weathley from Liverpool FC affirms that it even changed the way the
game is played. All these improvements were realizable with the important
amount of money media inject in football (Canal + for France and BskyB for
England). </p>
<p Align=center><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy49.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=justify>Media's influence is even more important in France because
half of the club's income depends on the television deal between Canal + and
the LFP. Media are major partners of football clubs. Thanks to their
investment, they are allowed to schedule the games they want to show on
television. Normally, clubs play on saturdays and sundays but some games are
scheduled on fridays or mondays nights. Clubs have to accept these changes. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy50.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>Although BskyB did not succeed when trying to buy Manchester
United, media companies are involved as shareholders in football clubs.
Liverpool F.C. is a good illustration of this investment. Ten percent of the
club belongs to Granada TV. Granada TV also has a commercial deal with
Liverpool F.C. concerning the exploitation of the club's licence. Granada TV
bought the rights to exploit commercially the LFC licence. Those two
organisations are also linked in a joint-venture to develop the website
`liverpooltv', which involves new technologies. According to Sir Norman Chester
Centre (2002), this deal is indicative of the new media/sport synergy. The
press influence, although not as consequent, can be important. The press has
the power to influence the public opinion, which means fans, sponsors,
institutions... All the stakeholders read the newspapers (and trust most of
what they read). So the press is able to create a positive image of a club, as
well as a negative one. It can spread the discontent. As the official news from
the clubs are not always consistent enough to fulfil two pages everyday,
newspapers can develop minor information to `create' scandals or rumours. It
can destabilize clubs. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc37"></A>4.2.6. Institutions </h3>

<p Align=left>Football is an entertainment for people, and institutions are
aware of that. Institutions' expectations are far higher than football
entertaining people. Institutions expect football clubs to be part of the
community support. Institutions expect that football remains accessible to
everyone in the community, especially to poor people. Institutions want
football clubs and their players to be example for the youth; they want clubs
to train some locals and to help them to become professional players / coaches,
to help amateur football clubs. To become concrete examples for everyone,
institutions wish that football clubs help the local charities. Institutions
control that football clubs take decision agreeing with their stakeholders.
Morality apart, institutions hope that football clubs help to develop the local
economy by working with local suppliers, by developing tourism... Everton and
Liverpool F.C. are considered as major economic actors in the City of
Liverpool, according to Johnstone (2002). The most important economic benefit
for the community is employment and institutions expect that football clubs
hire as numerous staff as possible. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy51.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>Institutions also hope that football clubs' performance will
increase the region's notoriety. Maillard (2003) explains that it is the case
at Lens where eighty-three percent of people associate the city with its
football club, according to a study. </p>
<p Align=left>Public institutions have direct influence on football clubs'
strategy. First, although a French law limits these subventions to &#163;2.5
million-a-year; they often give some money to local football clubs. Public
institutions represent sixteen percent of Amiens S.C. total income, as much as
the club's fans! Even if they do not give this money, they can help the club
buy buying some advertising around the stadium. It is what the city of Lens
does: it buys advertising for &#163;155,812 every year, according to Maillard
(2003). Another delicate chapter of relations between institutions and football
clubs is the exploitation of the stadium. Stadiums usually belong to cities and
football clubs exploits it. In the case of Amiens S.C., Amiens rents it for
free to the club. In Lens, the city council ask for &#163;190,090 per year; it
is more than what this institution gives to the club... Football clubs are kept
apart from political questions. Mayors from any political party support
football clubs because of their popularity. So, political changes do not have
much influence on the clubs. Institutions also have an indirect power on
football clubs: they can prevent clubs from some actions. As institutions rule
their region, in case of conflict with the club (it may happen), institution
can disturb it. For example, the R.C. Lens organises annually a carnival with
its fans in the city and it requires agreement from the institutions, which is
not always easy to obtain. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc38"></A>4.2.7. Organizations </h3>

<p Align=left>First, it is essential to define which organizations deal with
football clubs. At a worldwide level, the FIFA set up the rules of the game,
control transfers and judge conflicts between clubs. Then, the UEFA is the
represent of the FIFA at the European level; it manages the European
competitions. At a national level, the LFP manages all the professional French
football clubs (Ligue 1 and Ligue 2). For the same function we have two
organizations in England: the Premier League cares about League 1 clubs, when
the Football Association manages the professional football clubs of Divisions
1, 2, 3 and 4. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy52.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>These organizations' expectation is that football clubs become
popular ambassadors of this sport so that it becomes attractive to ever more
people. They expect clubs to respect the rules set up to avoid any conflict,
negative for football's image. </p>
<p Align=left>Theses organizations have power and influence on every club. They
set up the rules of the game clubs have to admit. They also impose football
clubs to have certain structures to welcome spectators; otherwise clubs are not
able to enter competitions. Most of these structure improvements deal with
fans' security. Football clubs can also be reprimanded at a sportive level by
those organizations: they can affect their rank by withdrawing some points the
clubs won. In England the Premier League also imposes some commercial rules.
For example, clubs are not allowed to change their replica shirt every year,
but only every two years for fans to be able to buy their favourite club shirt.
According to Scudamore (2002), even the price fixing of replica shirts respects
rules enacted by the Premier League. In France, the LFP created an independent
commission to analyse the clubs' financial accounts, the DNCG. Clubs must have
a guarantee for any of their debt; otherwise they will be relegated to the
inferior division. As football clubs often have `weak' finances, this
commission aims at improving football clubs' situation. But this commission is
unique in France and other European clubs do not have to follow such strict
rules. In a close future, the UEFA may set up the same type of commission at a
European level. But who would prevent Real Madrid, the best team in the world,
from playing the Champions League because it has about &#163;100 million debt?
The last, and not the least, element of national football organizations' power
is money. They are in charge to negotiate and reallocate the television rights
paid by media. As explained in part 4.2.5., this income is a need for football
clubs' survival. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc39"></A>4.2.8. Sponsors </h3>

<p Align=left>Sponsors have important commitment in football. Sponsors
associate their name with football clubs to benefit from their popularity.
Sponsors expect notorious brand recognition, so this increases with the teams
performances. When a team is successful, it attracts more fans in the stadium
and its games are shown on television. An association with a successful team is
an obvious benefit for sponsors. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy53.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>They also associate their image with the clubs' image, so they
expect football clubs to maintain a respectful image. Sponsors also invest
money in football to get new business opportunities and they expect clubs to
help them to develop special commercial program. It is the case with R.C. Lens,
where Nike and Orange target the densest and youngest region in France to
increase their notoriety and gain market shares, according to Laugier (2003).
Another expectation from sponsors is that they want to meet the players and to
make their customers to meet the players as well. They also expect advantageous
access to the games. </p>
<p Align=left>The influence on clubs they have comes from the help they bring.
It is not always financial. The sports brands like Nike, Adidas or Umbro supply
the sports materials to clubs (shirts, shoes, soccer balls...) to benefit of
brand exposure on the pitch. They also add financial investments for first
division clubs. </p>
<p Align=center><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy54.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=justify>Of course, sponsors do not seem as vital for English clubs as
for French ones, but they are an important part of clubs income. They also
provide presents for players like cars, watches and others. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc40"></A>4.2.9. Players' agents </h3>

<p Align=justify>Football players' agents are people who help football players
to manage their career, in counterpart of financial commission. They expect
from football clubs the best working condition for their players, a pleasant
welcome at the club and that all their players needs will be satisfied. It is
supposed that when a player has no upset, his performance on the pitch will be
at the top. Agents wish their players to become popular and to play in
notorious clubs. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy55.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>On the other side, agents expect clubs to be ready to negotiate
with them and to buy their players. </p>
<p Align=left>Agents do not have much importance on clubs' strategy, but they
are essential in any transfer. As intermediaries, agents cost money to clubs
because they ask for a financial retribution on each player's transfer from a
club to another. A positive element coming from agents is that they manage with
all the administrative forms, the salary negotiations (...), so the clubs do
not have to. They also can promote some exceptional players to clubs. As good
players are rare, to work with agents may be a way to improve clubs' team. On
the other side, agents can convince a player not to join a team because its
managers were not respectful enough with agents. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc41"></A>4.2.10. Other clubs </h3>

<p Align=left>Other football clubs are considered as competitors, and they are.
They have the same expectations as any football club: to attract more fans,
more sponsors, to win competitions... As their expectations are the same, a
club cannot get any benefit from another. </p>
<p Align=left>First, they compete on the pitch and a team's success depends
also on the other team's failure. Team's performance depends on the others.
Clubs also compete to buy the best players. Moreover, for example, Liverpool
F.C. and Everton are located in the same city and competition between those
clubs is sportive but not only: they negotiate to get the same subventions from
institutions, they compete to attract fans (merchandising, pricing...). So,
football clubs' mission is to improve themselves at each level to outclass
competitors. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc42"></A>4.2.11. Interests groups </h3>

<p Align=left>Two majors interests groups exist in football: the football
clubs' presidents association (UCPF in France), and the G14 at a European
level. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy56.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>The presidents' association negotiates with national football
organizations (the LFP and Premier League) and the government, to improve their
business conditions. They put pressure to increase television deals amount, to
decrease taxes... The G14 is an organization representing the fourteen richest
European football clubs. This organisation has the same function as the
presidents' association but at an international level: they try to improve
football business conditions. </p>
<p Align=left>These organisations are football clubs' represents or lobbies and
so do not have any direct influence on them. Their influence is indirect and
depends on the government and football organizations' decisions. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc43"></A>4.2.12. Government </h3>

<p Align=left>Government's expectations towards football clubs are similar to
institutions' ones: they expect football clubs to get involved in community and
charities programs, to develop economically their region (especially
employment). Government works to improve the football image because at
international competitions, those clubs represents the country. According to
the Sir Norman Chester Centre (2002), the current administration and Tony Blair
have identified football as an important political tool and a key feature of a
modern and integrative Britain. </p>
<p Align=left>Although football clubs are mostly ruled by organizations like
the LFP and Premier League, they nevertheless have to comply with rules enacted
by the government and pay taxes like any company. Government financially
encourages clubs to develop education centres, employment programs and
community projects. The actual British Prime Minister is also close to Mr
Murdoch who owns a media empire and show football games on television in
counter part of expensive television rights. At least, some ministers are
football fans and clubs can benefit from advantages like renting rooms for
government meetings that will increase the notoriety of the clubs. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy57.png" alt=""></p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc44"></A>4.2.13. Banks </h3>

<p Align=justify>Banks expect that football clubs pay on time for their loans
encourage their players to open accounts with them. Football clubs manage huge
amounts of money and are attractive to banks but they are treated like any
other traditional company. </p>
<p Align=justify>Banks only have power on clubs which have financial
difficulties to try to improve their situation. </p>

<p Align=center>Figure 4.2 Archer's model applied to football clubs </p>
<p Align=center>Source : Archer (1995). </p>
<p Align=justify>This stakeholders' mapping is useful to analyse how football
clubs manage their stakeholders. </p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc46"></A>4.3. How football clubs manage and communicate with
their stakeholders </h2>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc47"></A>4.3.1. Fans </h3>

<p Align=justify>Football clubs are very committed into communicating with
their fans. Despite managers are confronted to this crowd every week on match
day and can feel fans' mood there, they always try to improve communication
with them. Clubs now have an efficient tool, to get their fans' opinion: they
use Internet forum on the clubs' website. It is an expression place where
managers can easily discuss with fans, according to Mr Weathley of Liverpool
F.C. </p>
<p Align=justify>R.C. Lens has employed a fans' association member to deal with
its supporters, when Liverpool F.C. created an association with ex-players for
the same job. Nevertheless managers, coach and players often meet fans to talk
with them and feel their desire. Liverpool F.C. organises dinners with fans
from the mass, not fans' represents, and they often consult them through
surveys like for the creation of the new stadium. The group `Anfield 4 Ever'
opposed to the stadium move was invited to a meeting to discuss this </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy59.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>matter with the clubs' managers. At R.C. Lens, the president of
the club, the coach and some players organises meetings with the fans'
represents every three months. </p>
<p Align=left>Fans expect to access to good games for reasonable prices, and
they also expect their team to recruit the best players to win. According to
Mendelow and Archer's models, the clubs should have a protectionist attitude
towards them because they are key players. In a certain way clubs do, they try
to keep them. It is even truer in Liverpool City where two clubs of Premier
League share the same stadium. Liverpool F.C. benchmarks the Everton club about
its pricing policy, in order not to loose its fans by fixing pricing not
accessible to the community. Liverpool F.C. also improves regularly its
structure to welcome fans as comfortably as possible in Anfield Road stadium.
Thirty-five percent of the tickets are sold on match day to allow anyone to go
to the games, not only season members. The waiting list to become a season
member is booked for the next three years! To avoid its fans frustration and to
develop commercial potential, Liverpool F.C. will play, in 2006, in a brand new
stadium which capacity is about 60,000 to compare with the current one: 44,000
seats. Although Mintel (2002) reports that Liverpool F.C. does not really
exploit its commercial potential, the club organises stadium tours, developed
online merchandising and set up a club's museum. It also considers very
important to train its stewards for the games. Stoke City F.C. also eradicated
violence from its stadium by creating a `green card' to allow fans to enter its
stadium. But the most important measure is to keep tickets at an accessible
level. R.C. Lens is also proud not to have increased prices of season tickets
for the last three years. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc48"></A>4.3.2. Shareholders </h3>

<p Align=left>British football clubs do not communicate as frequently with
shareholders as with fans. Shareholders are invited to attend the annual
general meeting and the clubs publish their accounts every year or
twice-a-year. Most of shareholders attend home games, where they can meet the
clubs' managers. </p>
<p Align=left>Shareholders expect a certain satisfaction for their investment
and also personal privileges to access games. Theorists recommend finding a
compromise with these key players. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy60.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>English clubs have put in place special shareholders' lounge at
the stadium, to attend games. They have to endorse the club's strategy, what
they can do at the annual general meeting. Moreover, they often appoint key
employees. Liverpool F.C. never paid any dividend to its shareholders. In
counterpart, the club invests impressive amounts of money in the team, to
increase the shares' value through victories on the pitch. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc49"></A>4.3.3. Employees </h3>

<p Align=left>The communication with employees happens daily at the club,
through professional relationship. </p>
<p Align=left>Sir Norman Chester Centre (2002) reports that after the
Hillsborough drama, British football clubs started to employed qualified staff,
especially with marketing skills, rather than ex-players who needed a job. They
also run an equal opportunity staff policy. Mendelow would advise football
clubs to adopt a defensive strategy and to keep employees informed. In France,
the situation is completely different; the clubs' employees are not as
qualified as in England: almost none have post-graduate diploma. French
football clubs prefer to employ people close to the club independently of their
skills. R.C. Lens created about a hundred jobs in the last four years. The
wages policy is ruled by the compulsory minima, not by the clubs. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc50"></A>4.3.4. Players and coaches </h3>

<p Align=left>Clubs communicate with players on a frequent basis but this part
of the job is supposed to be assumed by the coaches. Coaches are supposed to
report any dysfunction for clubs' top managers to solve it. R.C. Lens has two
employees at the club committed to improve players' life. </p>
<p Align=left>Considered as key elements of the clubs, they put all their
efforts to satisfy them. To improve its team competition, Liverpool F.C. spent
&#163;60 million to buy new players and its </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy61.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>wages bill grew from &#163;14.6 million to &#163;48.9 million
between 1997 and 2001! LFC also upgraded its Melwood training complex and
invest money in its football school to `produce' its own players. In addition
to its two employees devoted to the players, R.C. Lens recently invested
&#163;10 million in new training equipments. The situation is now changing and
due to economical difficulties, clubs are now thinking about putting in place a
players' salary cap. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc51"></A>4.3.5. Media </h3>

<p Align=left>Football clubs communicate with media almost daily. The press is
always around the clubs and their players, to inform its readers about the
teams' news. Concerning the media industry, clubs are in contact with them when
a game is re-scheduled. Most of the contacts between media and football exist
between the media and the national football organizations (LFP and Premier
League). </p>
<p Align=left>Archer's model (1995) implies that clubs should have a protective
attitude with the media. Clubs are organised to answer the press demand. The
press departments at the clubs are more important than the fans or players'
ones. For example, LFC employs three full-time persons to deal with the press
and the club remains as open as possible. Clubs considers the press as a
delicate subject, that's why they usually installed policy not to comment
rumours or scandals. To answer media's expectations and to win, football clubs
invest impressive amounts of money in recruiting good players, so that the show
they offer has a better quality. Concerning the media industry, the Premier
League clubs as well as the French clubs base their forecasts on the two years
remaining contract with the television. It is not the case for Stoke City F.C.:
ITV Digital bought the rights to diffuse the Division One for &#163;200 million
but bankrupt last year. A new deal has to be found, through the intermediary of
the Football Association. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy62.png" alt=""></p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc52"></A>4.3.6. Institutions </h3>

<p Align=left>Institutions are consulted by clubs for any major event, like
move from stadium, but they also work together on many projects for the
community. Liverpool also created a full colour Community Newsletter in order
to improve communication on the work they do. Four thousand of copies are
distributed twice in the season. </p>
<p Align=left>Institutions expect the clubs to develop solidarity within the
community and to be an important economical actor. Archer (1995) and Mendelow
(1991) recommend, through their model, that clubs should adopt an opportunist
attitude towards institutions with minimum efforts. In France, this advice is
followed: excepted some invitations to games, clubs do not really take care of
institutions. This can also be explained by the decrease of forty-four percent
over the past four years of the subventions R.C. Lens received from
institutions. Economically, things are different. R.C. lens, for example, tries
to work as much as possible with companies from the same industrial region.
According to Maillard (2003), &#163;20 million were spent locally, by the club,
in the last two years and the club employs 240 people. The local taxes paid by
the club are about &#163;1.6 million per year. British clubs are more involved
in the community: they organise stadium tours, stage soccer schools for
children, they occasionally send their coaches to schools. Stoke City </p>
<p Align=left>F.C. even host birthday parties at the stadium! Liverpool F.C.
built a youth academy at Kirkby to help children with the school work, it also
works on an integration program set up for truants and delinquents. LFC spread
also a part of its profits between local and national charities. According to
Johnstone (2002), 3,000 full-time jobs in the Merseyside economy depend on the
football industry and football is used as a competitive tool in the declining
local economy. For every &#163;1 spent by the clubs (LFC and Everton),
&#163;0.31 remains in the city of Liverpool. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc53"></A>4.3.7. Organizations </h3>

<p Align=left>Football clubs' top managers (often the presidents) are
permanently communicating with the national football organizations because they
organise the football competition and judge the conflicts. </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy63.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>Theorists would consider those organisations as key players, and
they are. Clubs do not really have to manage this stakeholders group because
they have to comply with the decisions of the league. The only influence clubs
may have on these stakeholders is through interests groups. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc54"></A>4.3.8. Sponsors </h3>

<p Align=left>Football clubs have commercial departments to deal with the
sponsors. They are often in contact with them to negotiate contracts, but they
also meet them at the stadium on match day. </p>
<p Align=left>Sponsors expect to have a welcoming access to games, to increase
their notoriety and to set up commercial promotions with the clubs. At R.C.
Lens, the club installed special luxury rooms for their sponsors to negotiate
business affairs and to invite their customers at the games. Felix Bollaert
stadium has become a meeting place for the regional companies. The club also
tries to always meet its 450 sponsors' expectations (Mendelow (1991) recommends
keeping them satisfied) and works with them to develop commercial operations
targeting fans. Liverpool F.C. has an old tradition of sponsoring: it was the
first British club to have a shirt sponsor in 1978, according to Sir Norman
Chester Centre (2002). The club is said to be in regular contacts with these
stakeholders and it seems to be efficient: the clubs' main sponsor, Carlsberg,
is a business partner for more than ten years and just signed a new
three-year-deal worth up to &#163;15 million over the next three seasons. LFC
also keeps its equipments sponsor, Reebok, and has just signed a new contract
with them. Less important clubs maintain their good relationships with their
sponsors and these are often due to personal connections between top managers
of both organizations. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc55"></A>4.3.9. Players' agents </h3>

<p Align=left>In France, players' agents suffer of bad reputation, so clubs
communicate as rarely as possible with them. They only request their services
when needed, during the transfer </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy64.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>periods (January and the summer). The rest of the season, agents
seek clubs but most ofthem do not even meet them.In Great-Britain, football
clubs keep respectful relationship with the agents and work withthem all year
long. Communication with the agents, although careful and confidential,remains
important to them.</p>
<p Align=left>Top managers of the clubs deal directly with the agents and their
players, only when theyare interested in buying a player. Agents are numerous
and clubs do not attach any specialimportance when negotiating with them. They
have an opportunist attitude, like wouldhave recommended Archer (1995).Less
important clubs tried to avoid agents and to deal directly with players, to
save up thecost of an agent's commission. But this era is now over, every
player now has his agent,even some players of ten years old already signed with
agents. Clubs recognize that agents'administrative and negotiating skills are
useful when realizing a player transfer.</p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc56"></A>4.3.10. Other clubs </h3>

<p Align=left>Football clubs are in direct contact and confrontation each and
every week at the stadium. Football clubs do not communicate frequently with
each other, excepted when they negotiate players' transfers. </p>
<p Align=left>Archer (1995) and Mendelow (1991) recommend football clubs to
make minimum efforts managing their competitors and even to try to find a
compromise with them. A compromise is impossible when clubs' successes depend
on others' failures. But according to the theory, football clubs' managers do
not make efforts to treat their competitors though they try to keep a
respectful and positive attitude towards them. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc57"></A>4.3.11. Interests groups </h3>

<p Align=left>Considering the clubs of this study, only one is a member of the
G14 association. Liverpool F.C. is an active member of this group and so is
regularly in contact with it. Liverpool F.C. sends one of its most important
managers to the G14's meeting in Brussels </p>
<p Align=left><img src="stakeholders-football-club-strategy65.png" alt=""></p>
<p Align=left>How stakeholders influence football clubs' strategy ? September
2003 </p>
<p Align=left>twice a season. They also pay a `subscription' to finance this
group which employs five persons to communicate and defend their interests. The
football clubs' interests are united in this group, so management with this
stakeholder's category is enthusiastic. </p>
<p Align=left>Concerning the presidents' association, presidents of football
clubs attend these meetings regularly and so are parts of it. In France,
Gervais Martel, R.C. Lens' president is also the president of the U.C.P.F. </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc58"></A>4.3.12. Government </h3>

<p Align=left>Football clubs in both countries are not in direct contact with
the government, the LFP and the Premier League are. </p>
<p Align=left>When theorists would make minimum efforts and have an opportunist
attitude with this stakeholder, football clubs are careful about their
behaviour with ministers. They are at the top of the football business'
hierarchy pyramid. In France and England, football clubs invite ministers to
games and are pleased to welcome them at the stadium. British clubs are more
reactive to their government's demand. The example of Stoke City </p>
<p Align=left>F.C. putting a `green card' in place to fight violence in its
stadium is a direct response to the government's wishes. Liverpool and F.C. and
Tony Blair's team also work together on community programs. </p>

<p Align=left>Football clubs' managers interviewed were not very interested in
talking about banks.Their relations with banks are like any classical
company.Football clubs' debts are usually recovered by their major shareholders
for the club not tobankrupt. Clubs also develop commercial partnership with
banks to exchange discountsagainst accounts opening for their new players.</p>

<p Align=left><em>Sources: Valence (2003) and Budimlija (2003). </em></p>
<p Align=left>Football clubs are all based on the same business model. They can
be compared with their budget. For example, Liverpool F.C.'s one is 6.4 times
higher than Stoke City F.C.'s one! The rate is almost the same concerning the
French clubs. The main difference is in the notoriety of the second division
(Ligue 2 and Division One). When media fight and invest millions to buy the
Premier League television rights, nobody buys the Division One rights. ITV
Digital did and bankrupted. The lower divisions do not attract many fans
because they do not show the best players on the pitch, which is essential for
a good game. The best players in lower divisions are shortly bought by
important clubs. A vicious circle is in place: media do not develop less
important divisions and so fans are not attracted. To face this lack, less
important clubs develop their `own-produced' players. This solution offers a
double advantage: clubs do not have to buy players and they make money when
they transfer their players. Less important clubs also do not have resources
enough to employ skilled employees who could fully exploit and develop the
commercial potential of the club. It is also important to highlight that less
important clubs are more pessimistic than important ones, so their management
is more careful. In fact, when top clubs have financial difficulties, less
important ones are usually not so affected. </p>

<A NAME="toc63"></A>4.4.2. English clubs vs. French ones </h3>

<p Align=left>Differences between French and English clubs are numerous and
major. First, the attendances are lower in France (cf. table 4.6.), almost half
than English ones. This is not due to stadium capacity which are similar in
both countries, but to the culture. Football was created in England and people
there are ready to spend double money in football than French people. Many
other factors also influence the attendance. French football clubs keep
democratic pricing policy for their fans, so that stadium remains available to
everyone, but still the attendance remains lower. It may be due to the schedule
of the games. In England, games are played on sunday afternoons; when in France
games happen on saturday night. Families and young people are readier to attend
games on sunday afternoons. In France, problems due to violence in stadium are
not solved, which does not encourage families to come to these places.
Nowadays, French clubs are economically late compared with their European
competitors, so they have few successes and do not attract fans. Laugier (2003)
accuses French football clubs not to make needed efforts to attract people to
the stadium. The efforts may also be required from the media industry. When
BskyB invests double money than Canal + to buy the football television rights,
clubs' retribution do not allow the French clubs to invest as much money as
British ones in football. Moreover, French clubs do not exploit their
commercial potential because of the lack of skills required to do so. French
football clubs do not recruit any employee with MBA or MSc., they prefer to
invest in players. When British clubs access to private capital and increase
substantially their income, French clubs are ruled like associations by the
government. The French government does not allow football clubs to access the
Stock Exchange market, but it also limits its subventions from public
institutions with the Buffet Law. This does not help French football clubs. The
government also increased taxes paid by football clubs of fifty-six percent in
the last four years! The French government also imposed the creation of the
DNCG which is a powerful independent organisation that controls football clubs'
finance. It is an important action (unique in Europe) which helps French clubs
to recover from overextending and prevents them from bankruptcy. England is now
working on the creation of this type of organization. </p>

<p Align=left>French clubs also have a competitive advantage: they produce many
players. As they arenot rich enough to buy the best players in Europe, they
compensate by producing them.Although Liverpool F.C. seems to be an exception,
British clubs do not have the requiredstructure to produce numerous good
players.French football clubs can be considered as late compared with their
British competitors,but the French system also inspires many national football
organizations across Europe.</p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="toc64"></A>4.5. Recommendations </h3>

<p Align=left>Concerning the stakeholders' management, football clubs are very
committed into developing links with their stakeholders. Their top managers
seem conscious about the benefits stakeholders bring them. But there is a wrong
point as well: clubs take much care about the stakeholders increasing their
income and less about the others. The best example remains the relation with
the players' agents. Clubs treat them bad all year long excepting during the
transfer periods. If clubs would develop a trespectful and true relationship
with them, they would benefit from their expertise and network to find
exceptional players. It is also important to highlight that French football
clubs are not committed enough to community programs if we compare with English
clubs. This is something important to improve. Concerning the competition, at a
European level, rules should be imposed to improve the clubs' finance by
forbidding access to competitions for overextended clubs. This would prevent
clubs from financial abuses which drive to bankruptcy. English football clubs
developed transparency in financial affairs and it would be a great example for
French ones. English clubs should benchmark France to develop their football
schools. It is certain that access to Stock Exchange market would provoke an
exceptional increase for French club's income. But are these clubs skilled
enough to manage this added money? To access financial markets, football clubs
would be required to have made profits for the last three years which is the
case of almost none French club. This rule from the Commission des
Op&eacute;rations de Bourse (C.O.B.) limits the number of clubs who would
benefit this access. Football clubs are also too dependent of their income from
television right. To avoid a disaster, they should diversify their income as
much as possible. </p>

<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc65"></A>5. CONCLUSION </h1>

<p Align=left>This research has been an interesting one. To conclude on
football club's stakeholders' management, it is possible to affirm that it is
well developed and quite efficient. The best example would be the collaborative
work between the institutions and the clubs to eradicate violence. Everyone
would agree that the change has been spectacular and substantial. Football
clubs have higher consideration of their stakeholders than traditional
companies do. This may be due to the frequent meetings (at games) between
clubs' top managers and these groups. </p>
<p Align=left>To meet four clubs' top managers has been essential for this
research. They represent the core of relationships with the stakeholders and
their answers were truthful and not biased. Although the information they gave
was brilliant, with more time the author would have interviewed the
stakeholders themselves to obtain certainly more information. To study how
stakeholders maintain their power and pressure on football clubs would be an
interesting research subject. </p>
<p Align=left>The last, and not least, benefit of this research is personal to
the author. He wishes to work for football clubs and, thanks to this study, he
improved his knowledge about football business sector and met important actors
of this business. These contacts added to his knowledge will be essential for
his future professional career. </p>
