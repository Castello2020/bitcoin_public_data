<p Align=justify>This study examined how Etablissement Kazoza Justin et
Compagnie (EKJ &amp; Cie) handled potential risks which were threatening its
business. It was guided by four objectives. It adopted a case study design,
used both qualitative and quantitative research methods for data collection. It
covered 50 respondents and employed interviews, questionnaires and observation
methods for data collection. The findings from interviews revealed that there
are no structured and written risk management plans but still employees have
some knowledge about risk as confirmed by interviewees. Ninety two percent of
respondents confirmed to have had trainings related to risk management, 84%
expressed their concern about physical and technological risks. Seventy four
percent had been once at risk which could put their life in danger. Also,
respondents demonstrated their need of protective equipment by 88% but this
number dropped to nearly 57% with no convincing reasons as the management
confirmed their existence. Respondents admitted by 72% that they don't know
whether there are risk management plans within the company but, nearly the same
percentage confirmed the existence of rules and regulations that govern the
company. All respondents (100%) know that they have health insurance which
helps them to pay less when they are sick or their close relatives. As far as
the future of risk management is concerned, the management is planning to hire
a consultant to carry out the feasibility study. The study demonstrated needs
for the enterprise management to come up with strong operational risk
management plans. </p>

<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc299713904"></A><A NAME="_Toc305766912"></A><A
NAME="toc11"></A>1.1 Background to the study<br></h2>

<p Align=justify>Risk is usually defined as an assessment of the possibility of
some adverse event occurring and the likely consequences of this event. Risk is
inherent in the functions and activities of any organisation and its service
providers.</p>
<p Align=justify>Risks can come from uncertainty in all areas such as in
accidents, natural causes, business and project failures, attack from
adversaries etc (Hillson D.1997). Any business has exposure to a diverse range
of risks. This exposure includes professional risks, commercial risks,
political risks, risks to beneficiaries, community services and risks
associated with competition. The organisation's main risk mitigation strategies
to date have included administrative, contractual, technical, safety and
management controls as a part of business and program activities
<em>(</em>www.treasury.act.gov.au).</p>
<p Align=justify>As the consequences of an adverse event may include an
inability to meet beneficiary and customer requirements, financial loss,
organisational or political embarrassment, operational disruption, legal
problems, and so forth, it is important that management policies, procedures
and practices are in place to minimise the organisation's exposure to risk.
Risk management involves adopting and applying a systematic process to
identify, analyse, assess, control and monitor risk so that it is reduced and
maintained within an acceptable level. Risk management is a business tool and a
part of &#171;good management&#187; and good planning processes. (Hillson
D.1997)</p>
<p Align=justify>Risk management is a key part of improving a business and
services to be a leading business. The aim is to achieve best practice in
controlling all the risks to which business is exposed. To achieve this aim,
risk management standards should be created, maintained and continually
improved. This will involve risk identification and risk evaluation linked to
practical and cost-effective risk control measures. (
<A HREF="http://www.riskmanagement.com.au/" rel="nofollow">www.standards.com.au</A>)</p>
<p Align=justify>Risk management is a continuous process demanding awareness
and proactive action from all the organisation's employees and outsourced
service providers to reduce the possibility and impact of accidents and losses,
whether caused by the organisation or externally. Risk management is a core
responsibility for all managers.  Suitable risk management activities should be
incorporated into the business planning, operations and the management.
(<strong></strong><A NAME="_Hlt59496969"></A>
<A HREF="http://www.insuranceriskadvice.act.gov.au" rel="nofollow">www.insuranceriskadvi<A
NAME="_Hlt59496935"></A>ce.act.gov.au<strong></strong></A>).</p>
<p Align=justify>Risk management is one way of business planning and
implementation process, but, the fact of having a Risk Management Plan (RMP) is
not enough, it must be operational and all company's employees must be aware of
it and get trainings on how it is implemented. These trainings are mandatory
because these ones must know how to prevent some risks and how they behave in
front of a materialized risk (issue) because they may be themselves either,
source of risk or be at risk if not well protected (www.treasury.act.gov.au).
Importantly, the research will assess the level of risk management in private
institutions.</p>
<p Align=justify>Risks are everywhere in this world, it is almost impossible
for all of them to be prevented or controlled before they appear. Some risks
are harder to identify and prevent their occurrences (e.g. risks of a natural
disaster like Tsunami, draught, floods etc). But, some of them are manageable
and preventable but do occur and cause serious negative consequences in life
simply because of ignorance, negligence or lack of planning (
<A HREF="http://www.mindtools.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindtools.com</A>). Etablissement
Kazoza et Compagnie (EKJ&amp;CIE)  is a fourteen year old company working in
Rwanda involved in house and road building, electrical ware repair. &nbsp;With
time and of the ambitious plans by owners, its capacity was increased time to
time. However, EKJ&amp;CIE like any other business company faces a high market
competition of similar and older companies registered in the Rwanda Development
Board (RDB). Among others, it faces risks like high competition, theft,
environmental pollution, physical injuries to the personnel, fire, IT fraud,
insecurity among others which may cause negative consequences such as financial
loss, injuries, deaths of employees etc (
<A HREF="http://www.morebusiness.com" rel="nofollow">www.morebusiness.com</A>)  despite good
financial investments. The success on the open market requires many factors
among which the risk management plays a big role. </p>

NAME="toc15"></A><A NAME="toc16"></A>1.2  <A NAME="_Toc305766913"></A>Statement
of the problem</h2>

<p Align=justify>The EKJ &amp; CIE like any other business company was under
threat of a number of business risks. These are linked with high competition,
tax penalties, theft, insufficient capital investments, unstable human
resource, physical injuries to personnel, fraud, global economy crisis etc. </p>
<p Align=justify>The researcher investigated the company's operational risk
management plan, assessed challenges they face and examined the current trend
in risk management. The researcher also assessed the level of awareness of
company's staff about risk and how they deal with them. </p>

out the gap in risk management between the current and the one desired and made
appropriate recommendations to the management of EKJ&amp;CIE which other

</blockquote>

<p Align=justify>This study covered only the area of risk management whereby
the researcher analysed how the management assessed, treated and communicated
risks. The research demonstrated risk management plans used in EKJ&amp;CIE,
identified challenges faced, assessed the level of awareness of the staff and,
examined the current trend of EKJ&amp;CIE in risk management. It was a case
study due to financial and time constraints and was carried out in EKJ&amp;CIE
and covered the period from 2006 to 2011.</p>

</blockquote>

<p Align=justify>Risks are worldwide and human beings need to control and
minimize them at some extent in order to cope with life. In the
business/project environment, it is ideal to equip with a well structured risk
management which requires sequential and orderly phases namely; Risk
identification, quantification, response, monitoring and control. However,
there have been a lot of researches done in other countries regarding risk
management as one of business promoting strategies. However, in Rwanda, there
was no research done concerning risk management in private businesses/projects
and therefore no information was available on risk management as business
promoting strategy. The study highlighted the role of risk management plans,
challenges of risk management plans, the current trends of risk management and
the employee awareness regarding risk management in EKJ&amp;CIE.</p>
<p Align=justify><A NAME="_Toc288832635"></A>It was hoped that the findings
from this study would be relevant to a variety of beneficiaries including the
researcher, Kabale University, future readers of the findings as well as the
EKJ&amp;CIE management. </p>

<p Align=justify><A NAME="_Toc288832642"></A>Private business development is
one of development leading factors in any country. However, there are many
factors that influence this growth either inside the business institution
itself or from outside of it. One of those factors is the government policies
(other variables) in relation with trade, taxes etc. In Rwanda for instance,
the doing business policy allows new entrepreneurs to register in Rwanda
development board and start the business within 24 hours only. </p>
<p Align=justify>The business establishment is not enough, it requires other
factors for its growth and sustainability like risk management (dependent
variable) among others. This is a continuous process whose purpose is to
clarify the importance and events for tackling the risks that the business may
face. Risk management is important because it gives the ability to figure out
methods for which events can be managed, especially those events that may have
an adverse impact on the financial or human capital of the organization.</p>
<p Align=justify> This includes the information about the evaluation of various
risks and four options for managing each risk (intermediate variables) which
are risk identification, quantification, response and risk monitoring and
control. This is a proactive process and not reactive.</p>
<p Align=justify>The implementation of the risk management process illustrated
above leads to the following positive outcomes (consequential variables);
prevention of financial losses whereby resources are well planned and
allocated, risk awareness by all employees of the institution by following
internal rules and regulations and obeying the law among others which leads to
quality management, establishing good business plans, adequate communication
within the business organisation which in combination lead to a business growth
of the institution (independent variable)</p>

NAME="toc24"></A>2.0 Introduction</h2>

<p Align=justify><br>This chapter gives an overview of the literature of other
researchers and writers about risk management. However key words are well
explained and theories are discussed. The historical back ground of risk
management is explained, dangers and benefits of implementing a risk management
plan, challenges of risk management and the current trend of risk
management.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc288832644"></A><A NAME="_Toc305766930"></A><A
NAME="toc25"></A>2.1 Overview of Risk Management</h2>

<p Align=justify><br>The entire history of the human species is a chronology of
exposure to misfortune and adversity of efforts to deal with risks. Although it
is perhaps an exaggeration to claim that the earliest profession was risk
management, it can be argued that from the dawn of their existence, humans have
faced the problem of survival, not only as individuals but as species. The
initial human concern was a quest for security and avoidance of the risks that
threatened extinction. Our continued existence is testimony to the success of
our ancestors in managing risk (Emmett, 1997).</p>
<p Align=justify>The real risk management record is from Babylon in the code of
Hammurabi, dating from around 2100 BC (Sadgrove, 2005). This concerned a form
of naval insurance whereby the owner of the vessel can borrow money to buy
cargo and does not have to pay the debt if the ship is lost at the sea. Until
recently insurance was still the main way that companies managed risk. Thus in
1960s and 1970s insurance companies sought to reduce their potential losses by
encouraging businesses to make their premises safer. This was the
&#171;1<sup>st</sup> age&#187; of risk management. Currently, insurance desire
other aspects for risk management.</p>
<p Align=justify>Businesses considered only non entrepreneurial risk (such as
security). They also used risk reactively, to see how much insurance they
should buy. In 1980s, businesses started to introduce quality assurance, to
ensure that products conformed to their specifications. This was heralded by
the British Standard Institutions (BSI) launching the quality standard BS5750
in 1979. In this, the &#171;2<sup>nd</sup> age&#187; of risk management,
companies treated risk in a more proactive or preventive way (Emmet, 1997). </p>
<p Align=justify>In 1993, James Lam became the world's first Chief Risk
Officer, at the US financial services firm GE capital.</p>
<p Align=justify>The &#171;3<sup>rd</sup> age&#187; of risk management arrived
in 1995 with the publishing by Standards Australia of world's risk management
standard, AS/NZS4360: 1995, which has now been updated three times. This was
followed by the Canadian standard, CAN/CSA-Q850-97 (Fone &amp; Young, 2000).
</p>
<p Align=justify>It is not known when exactly risk management was used in
Africa in general and in east Africa in particular but, really, as in the
middle-east and Europe. Africans also had their ways of handling risks and
issues even though data were not recorded like other parts of the world because
of illiteracy. For instance, in the field of prediction and early warning of
disasters, the Luo community in the Lake Victoria basin had a large number of
climate monitoring indicators that enabled them to tell such things as the
right time to start planting in anticipation of the rains or to preserve and
store food in anticipation of a dry season. These indicators included
observation of the behaviour of animals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects,
vegetation and trees, winds, temperatures and celestial bodies. In the area of
animal health, the Maasai, who inhabit both Kenya and Tanzania, had at least
half a dozen different medicinal plants for treating East Coast Fever alone in
cattle. In farming technologies, the Matengo people, believed to have lived in
the steep slopes of Matengo Highlands since the Iron Age, had developed a
sophisticated system that enabled them to grow crops on hillsides while at the
same time controlling soil erosion and improving soil moisture and fertility.
For example, the Banyala community in Budalang'i living on the shores of Lake
Victoria had a well-organized system for mitigating impeding disasters. There
were elders who dealt with rainfall prediction and early warning. Each
homestead had a dugout canoe ready for transport in case of heavy flooding.
Each community was also required to dig trenches to control the water around
the homestead and around farmlands. In addition, they were required to avoid
ploughing along the lake shores when heavy flooding was predicted and were
advised to catch fish during April-August rainy period when they were plentiful
and preserve them by drying and smoking for use in times of scarcity.</p>
<p Align=justify>Those living on the highlands were expected to accommodate
neighbours displaced by floods in the lowlands, which were flood prone areas,
and so on.</p>
<p Align=justify>In Swaziland, where drought and occasional floods are common
disasters, communities took precautions after predicting disasters. For
example, they used the height of the nests of the emahlokohloko bird (Ploceus
spp.) on trees to predict floods. When floods are likely to occur the nesting
of the emahlokohloko is very high up the trees next to a river and when floods
are unlikely the nests are low down. The Swazis also used the cry of certain
birds to predict rain and yields of certain wild fruit plants to predict
famine. Other indigenous methods used by the Swazis to predict natural hazards
include wind direction, the shape of the crescent moon and the behaviour of
certain animals (UNEP, 2008). </p>

<p Align=justify>Some experts have said that a strong risk management process
can decrease problems on a project/business by as much as 80 or 90 percent
(www.executivebrief.com)</p>
<p Align=justify>There are four stages to risk management planning; Risk
Identification, Risks Quantification, Risk Response and Risk Monitoring and
Control (
<A HREF="http://www.projectperfect.com" rel="nofollow">www.projectperfect.com</A>).</p>


<h3 class="core">

NAME="_Toc305766932"></A><A NAME="toc27"></A>2.2.1 Risk Identification <br></h3>

<p Align=justify>It consists of identifying and naming all possible risks. The
best approach is a workshop with all staff to carry out the identification by
using a combination of brainstorming and reviewing of standard risk lists (
<A HREF="http://www.projectperfect.com" rel="nofollow">www.projectperfect.com</A>). Other
researchers have identified other methods to identify risks by using a risk
calculator (www.referenceforbusiness.com). The risk calculator measures three
kinds of internal pressures: risk stemming from growth, corporate culture, and
information management. Using the risk calculator, managers can determine if
their company has a safe or dangerous amount of risk. </p>
<p Align=justify>Although the risk calculator is not a precise tool, it does
indicate areas where risks and potential losses exist, such as the rate of
expansion and the level of internal competition.</p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="_Toc299713924"></A><A NAME="_Toc305766933"></A><A
NAME="toc28"></A>2.2.1.1 Objectives of Risk Identification</h3>

<p Align=justify>The objectives of risk identification are to identify and
categorize risks that could affect the project and
<A HREF="http://international.fhwa.dot.gov/riskassess/risk_hcm06_g.cfm" rel="nofollow"></A>
document these risks. The outcome of risk identification is a list of risks.
What is done with the list of risks depends on the nature of the risks and the
project. On noncomplex, low-cost projects with little uncertainty (few risks),
the risks may be kept simply as a list of red flag items. The items can then be
assigned to individual team members to watch throughout the project development
process and used for risk allocation purposes. On complex, high-cost projects
that are by nature uncertain, the risks can feed the rigorous process of
assessment, analysis, mitigation and planning, allocation, and monitoring and
updating described in this document (Highways Agency 2001).</p>
<p Align=justify>The risk identification process should stop short of assessing
or analyzing risks so that it does not inhibit the identification of "minor"
risks. The process should promote creative thinking and leverage team
experience and knowledge. In practice, however, risk identification and risk
assessment are often completed in a single step, a process that can be called
risk assessment. For example, if a risk is identified in the process of
interviewing an expert, it is logical to pursue information on the probability
that it will occur, its consequences/impacts, the time associated with the risk
(i.e., when it might occur), and possible ways of dealing with it. The latter
actions are part of risk assessment, but they often begin during risk
identification (Federal Highway administration, 2005). </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="_Toc299713925"></A><A NAME="_Toc305766934"></A><A
NAME="toc29"></A>2.2.1.2 Risk Identification Process</h3>

<p Align=justify>The risk identification process begins with the team compiling
the risk events. The identification process will vary, depending on the nature
of the project and the risk management skills of the team members, but most
identification processes begin with an examination of issues and concerns
created by the project development team. These issues and concerns can be
derived from an examination of the project/business description, work breakdown
structure, cost estimate, design and construction schedule, procurement plan,
or general risk checklists. The team should examine and identify events by
reducing them to a level of detail that permits an evaluator to understand the
significance of any risk and identify its causes, (i.e., risk drivers). This is
a practical way of addressing the large and diverse numbers of potential risks
that often occur on highway design and construction projects. Risks are those
events that team members determine would adversely affect the project (Highways
Agency, 2001).</p>
<p Align=justify>After the risks are identified, they should be classified into
groups of like risks. Classification of risks helps reduce redundancy and
provides for easier management of the risks in later phases of the risk
analysis process. Classifying risks also provides for the creation of risk
checklists, risk registers, and databases for future projects (Federal Highway
Administration, 2005). </p>
<p Align=justify>Numerous techniques are available to facilitate risk
identification after documents have been reviewed. Brainstorming, scenario
planning, and expert interviews are tools commonly used. The nominal group
method allows each team member to create a list individually. The Delphi method
is a process in which each team member individually and anonymously lists
potential risks and their inputs. The Crawford slip method allows the team to
individually list up to 10 risks. Afterward these risks are divided by the team
into various categories and logged by category. Influence or risk diagramming
is explained in the 
<A
HREF="http://international.fhwa.dot.gov/riskassess/risk_hcm06_04.cfm" rel="nofollow">"Probability
or Decision Trees and Influence Diagrams"</A>. Nominal group, Delphi, Crawford
slip, and influence diagramming also serve as good tools for risk assessment,
which is often blurred with risk identification (Operations, 2005)</p>
<p Align=justify>The key to success with any risk identification tool or
technique is to assist the experts in identifying risks. People and the
agency's risk culture are the keys to continuous risk identification and risk
management. The documents and techniques should only support the people in the
risk assessment process and never inhibit or replace the engineering judgment
required for a comprehensive risk identification process (United States
Department of Labour, 2003)</p>
<p Align=justify>The risk identification process identifies and categorizes
risks that could affect the project/business. It documents these risks and, at
a minimum, produces a list of risks that can be assigned to a team member and
tracked throughout the project/business development and delivery process. Risk
identification is continuous and new risks should continually be invited into
the process. The tools and techniques should support the risk identification
process, but it will be the people involved in the exercises who are most
critical to the success of the process (Highways Agency 2001).</p>

<p Align=justify><A NAME="_Toc288157975"></A>Following the risk identification
and qualitative risk assessment phases, risks are characterized by their
frequency of occurrence and the severity of their consequences. Frequency and
severity are the two primary characteristics used to screen risks and separate
them into minor risks that do not require further management attention and
significant risks that require management attention and possibly quantitative
analysis. Various methods have been developed to help classify risks according
to their seriousness. One common method is to develop a two-dimensioned matrix
that classifies risks into three categories based on the combined effects of
their frequency and severity. 
<A HREF="http://international.fhwa.dot.gov/riskassess/risk_hcm06_03.cfm" rel="nofollow">It</A>
requires classifying risks into one of five states of likelihood (remote
through near certain) and into five states of consequence (minimal through
unacceptable). These assessments yield a five-by-five matrix that classifies a
risk as either "high" (red), "moderate" (yellow), or "low" (green).</p>
<p Align=justify>Risks need to be quantified in two dimensions. The impact of
the risk needs to be assessed. The probability of risk to occur needs to be
assessed. For simplicity, rate each on a 1 to 4 scale. </p>
<p Align=justify>The larger the number, the high is the impact or probability
of that event to occur. By using a matrix, a priority can be established
(www.projectperfect.com).</p>
<p Align=justify>If probability is high, and impact is low, it is a Medium
risk. On the other hand if impact is high, and probability low, it is High
priority. A remote chance of a catastrophe warrants more attention than a high
chance of a hiccup (www.projectperfect.com).</p>

NAME="toc31"></A>2.2.2.1 Low Risk Events</h3>

<p Align=justify>Risks that are characterized as low can usually be disregarded
and eliminated from further assessment. As risk is periodically reassessed in
the future, these low risks are closed, retained, or elevated to a higher risk
category (www.projectperfect.com).</p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="_Toc299713928"></A><A NAME="_Toc305766937"></A><A
NAME="toc32"></A>2.2.2.2 Moderate Risk Events</h3>

<p Align=justify>Moderate-risk events are either high-likelihood,
low-consequence events or low-likelihood, high-consequence events. An
individual high-likelihood, low-consequence event by itself would have little
impact on project cost or schedule outcomes. However, most projects contain
myriad such risks (material prices, schedule durations, installation rates,
etc.); the combined effect of numerous high-likelihood, low-consequence risks
can significantly alter project outcomes. Commonly, risk management procedures
accommodate this high-likelihood, low-consequence risks by determining their
combined effect and developing cost and/or schedule contingency allowances to
manage their influence (www.projectperfect.com).</p>
<p Align=justify>Low-likelihood, high-consequence events, on the other hand,
usually warrants individualized attention and management. At a minimum,
low-likelihood, high-consequence events should be periodically monitored for
changes either in their probability of occurrence or in their potential impacts
(www.projectperfect.com).</p>

<A NAME="_Toc299713929"></A><A NAME="_Toc305766938"></A><A
NAME="toc33"></A>2.2.2.3 High Risk Events<br></h3>

<p Align=justify>High-risk events are so classified either because they have a
high likelihood of occurrence coupled with at least a moderate impact or they
have a high impact with at least moderate likelihood. In either case, specific
directed management action is warranted to reduce the probability of occurrence
or the risk's negative impact (www.projectperfect.com).</p>

<p Align=justify>Risk identification, assessment, and analysis exercises form
the basis for sound risk response options. A series of risk response actions
can help agencies and their industry partners avoid or mitigate the identified
risks. Wideman, in the Project Management Institute standard Project and
Program Risk Management: A Guide to Managing Risks and Opportunities, states
that a risk may be the following; unrecognized, unmanaged, or ignored (by
default), recognized, but no action taken (absorbed by a matter of policy),
avoided (by taking appropriate steps), reduced (by an alternative approach),
transferred (to others through contract or insurance), retained and absorbed
(by prudent allowances) or handled by a combination of the above.</p>
<p Align=justify>The above categorization of risk response options helps
formalize risk management planning. The Caltrans Project Risk Management
Handbook suggests a subset of strategies from the categorization defined by
Wideman above. The Caltrans handbook states that the project development team
must identify which strategy is best for each risk and then design specific
actions to implement that strategy. The strategies and actions in the handbook
include the following:</p>
<p Align=justify>1. Avoidance. The team changes the project plan to eliminate
the risk or to protect the project objectives from its impact. The team might
achieve this by changing scope, adding time, or adding resources (thus relaxing
the so-called triple constraint).</p>
<p Align=justify>2. Transference. The team transfers the financial impact of
risk by contracting out some aspect of the work. Transference reduces the risk
only if the contractor is more capable of taking steps to reduce the risk and
does so.</p>
<p Align=justify>3. Mitigation. The team seeks to reduce the probability or
consequences of a risk event to an acceptable threshold. It accomplishes this
via many different means that are specific to the project and the risk.
Mitigation steps, although costly and time consuming, may still be preferable
to going forward with the unmitigated risk.</p>
<p Align=justify>4. Acceptance. The project manager and team decide to accept
certain risks. They do not change the project plan to deal with a risk or
identify any response strategy other than agreeing to address the risk if it
occurs.</p>
<p Align=justify>Given a clear understanding of the risks, their magnitude, and
the options for response, an understanding of project risk will emerge. This
understanding will include where, when, and to what extent exposure will be
anticipated. The understanding will allow for thoughtful risk planning (Traffic
Management Act, 2005).</p>
<p Align=justify>There are five types of strategies that are being used
according to the level of risk that exists: risk avoidance, risk reduction,
risk transfer, risk sharing and risk retention . Risk avoidance takes place
when there are either poor arrangements or hazards that cannot be controlled,
and hence, managers postpone the activity or offer an alternative one
(Swarbrooke et al, 2003; Parkhouse, 2005; Beech and Cladwick, 2004). In risk
reduction, all activities should be managed by capable and well-trained
leaders, who have the experience and the competence to cope with possible risks
(Swarbrooke et al, 2003; Beech and Cladwick, 2004; Outhart et al, 2003).
Managers often employ the risk transfer method, in which the risk is
transferred to insurance companies, to the clients or to third parties
(Centner, 2005; Swarbrooke et al, 2003; Beech and Chadwick, 2004; Boyle, 2000).
Finally, risk retention is a strategy during which mainly low risks are being
accepted either unconsciously or because of incapability to transfer them to
others.</p>
<p Align=justify>A risk response plan should include the strategy and action
items to address the strategy. The actions should include what needs to be
done, who is doing it, and when it should be completed. </p>

<p Align=justify>The final step is to continually monitor risks to identify any
change in the status, or if they turn into an issue. It is best to hold regular
risk reviews to identify actions outstanding, risk probability and impact,
remove risks that have passed, and identify new risks (

<p Align=justify>Monitoring and control is not complete unless communication
has occurred. Communication<strong><em> </em></strong>is the lynch-pin of
effective project management and risk management. Communication within and
among the team will be crisp, concise, complete, correct and timely as will the
communication to upper management and executives. Effectiveness of the risk
response actions will be monitored and reported regularly (Project Risk
Management, 2010).</p>
<p Align=justify>Risk monitoring and control is required in order to ensure the
execution of the risk plans and evaluate their effectiveness in reducing risk,
keep track of the identified risks, including the watch list, monitor triggers
conditions for contingencies, monitor residual risks and identify new risks
arising during project execution and updating the organizational process assets

<p Align=justify>The purpose is to determine if risk responses have been
implemented as planned, actions are as effective as expected or if new
responses should be developed. Whether project assumptions are still valid,
risk exposure has changed from its prior state, with analysis of trends, if a
risk trigger has occurred, proper policies and procedures are followed or if
new risks have occurred that were not previously identified (

<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc305766942"></A><A NAME="toc42"></A>2.2.4.2 Inputs to risk
monitoring and control</h2>

<p Align=justify><strong>Risk Management Plan</strong>: The Risk Management
Plan is details how to approach and manage project risk. The plan describes the
how and when for monitoring risks. Additionally the Risk Management Plan
provides guidance around budgeting and timing for risk-related activities,
thresholds, reporting formats, and tracking (www.anticlue.net).</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Risk Register</strong>: The Risk Register contains the
comprehensive risk listing for the project. Within this listing the key inputs
into risk monitoring and control are the bought into, agreed to, realistic, and
formal risk responses, the symptoms and warning signs of risk, residual and
secondary risks, time and cost contingency reserves, and a watch list of
low-priority risks (www.anticlue.net). </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>The Approved Change Requests</strong>: They are the
necessary working methods and contracts. Changes can impact existing risk and
give rise to new risk. Approved change requests need to be reviewed from the
perspective of whether they will affect risk ratings and responses of existing
risks, and or if a new risk is a result (www.anticlue.net).</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Work Performance Information</strong>: Work
performance information is the status of the scheduled activities being
performed to accomplish the project work. When comparing the scheduled
activities to the baseline, it is easy to determine whether contingency plans
need to be put into place to bring the project back in line with the baseline
budget and schedule. By reviewing work performance information, one can
identify if trigger events have occurred, if new risk are appearing on the
radar, or if identified risks are dropping from the radar
(www.anticlue.net).</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Performance Reports</strong>: Performance reports
paint a picture of the project's performance with respect to cost, scope,
schedule, resources, quality, and risk. Comparing actual performance against
baseline plans may unveil risks which may cause problems in the future.
Performance reports use bar charts, S-curves, tables, and histograms, to
organize and summarize information such as earned value analysis and project
work progress. </p>
<p Align=justify>All of these inputs help the manager to monitor risks and
assure a successful project/business (

<p Align=justify>Management of risk is an integral part of good business
practice and quality management. Learning how to manage risk effectively
enables managers to improve outcomes by identifying and analysing the wider
range of issues and providing a systematic way to make informed decisions. A
structured risk management approach also enhances and encourages the
identification of greater opportunities for continuous improvement through
innovation (http://portal.surrey.ac.uk). </p>
<p Align=justify>Risk management techniques provide the personnel, at all
levels, with a systematic approach to managing the risks that are integral
parts of their responsibilities. Also, a number of studies have been undertaken
to identify the benefits that can be expected by those implementing a
structured approach to risk management (Newland, 1997). These benefits include;
better informed and achievable business plans, schedules and budgets, increased
likelihood of business growth, proper allocation of risk through the contract,
identification of best risk owner, improved communication etc.<A
NAME="_Toc288157979"></A><A NAME="_Toc288157797"></A> It is of paramount
importance for each business company, development project to have a working
risk management plan that help top managers to early identify and treat risks

all writings are from the developed world and there is little third world

management</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p Align=justify>Risk management challenges are implicit in a corporation's
activities because risk events are typically uncertain. An effective risk
management process helps a company's top leadership establish rules to prevent
operating losses due to human error, employee carelessness, technological
malfunction or fraud. To illustrate, a company's management may put into place
internal controls and procedures as well as periodic internal audit reviews to
ensure that employees comply with rules when performing duties. A risk
management policy also may cover financial risks such as credit and market
risks. Challenges that may arise in risk management processes may be
significant if a corporation does not establish proper decision-making
mechanisms, and internal controls are not adequate or functional. A functional
procedure provides appropriate solutions to internal problems. An adequate
policy instructs employees on how to perform tasks and report problems. Risk
management challenges may include staff non-compliance with rules and
regulations, technological problems due to software or hardware updates and
inaccuracies that may exist in financial market data. Also, Challenges may
relate to operational, technological or compliance risks (
<A HREF="http://www.ehow.com" rel="nofollow">www.ehow.com</A>). Other challenges like market
and credit risks are also common.</p>
<p Align=justify>Very few organizations find enterprise risk management
implementation easy. It requires a rare combination of organizational
consensus, strong executive management and an appreciation for various program
sensitivities. Despite the effort required, however, ERM is worth it because it
forces most organizations to step back and identify their risks, which is one
of the first steps to protecting capital and driving shareholder value. As
boards and executive management evaluate ERM, however, they usually come away
with more questions than answers. While each company faces specific concerns,
the more challenging ERM issues are generally consistent across companies and
are largely unrelated to industry, geography, regulation or competitive
landscapes. By examining some of these common ERM challenges, as well as the
creative solutions that have been applied by other organizations, management
will be better equipped to develop and revamp their own enterprise risk
management programs.</p>
<p Align=justify>However, J. Negus (2010) insisted on 10 ERM challenges
commonly found as the following: assessing ERM's value, privilege, defining
risk, risk assessment method, risk assessment method, time horizon, multiple
potential scenarios, ERM ownership, risk reporting as well as simulations and
stress tests.&nbsp;</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>1. Assessing ERM's Value</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The issue: In an economy driven by positive return on
investment, organizations often struggle to demonstrate sufficient ERM value to
justify implementation costs. While traditional investment decisions are
evaluated using common risk and reward metrics such as return on equity (ROE),
return on assets (ROA) and risk adjusted return on capital (RAROC), ERM value
drivers are less prescriptive. Despite growing guidance, ERM remains largely
voluntary, resulting in a value proposition void of compliance language and
regulatory encouragement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>2. Privilege</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The issue: An ERM program allows management to quantify the
company's risks. As risk information becomes increasingly event-driven and
dollar-based, company lawyers may raise issues regarding risk distribution to
external regulators, auditors and constituents. Organizations must balance risk
visibility and legal exposure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>3. Defining Risk</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The issue: One of the biggest challenges is establishing a
consistent and commonly applied risk nomenclature. Any inconsistencies between
risk definitions or methodologies are likely to jeopardize the program's
success.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>4. Risk Assessment Method</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The issue: Enterprise risk assessments are performed using a
variety of approaches and tools, including surveys, interviews and historical
analysis. Each approach offers its own value and drawbacks that must be closely
reviewed to determine organization
suitability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>5. Risk Assessment Method</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The issue: A key decision for many organizations is whether
risks are assessed using qualitative or quantitative metrics. The decision is
generally driven by the organization's industry, commitment to ERM, its view
regarding privilege and overall cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p Align=justify>The qualitative method provides management with general
indicators rather than specific risk scores. Qualitative results are commonly
presented as red, yellow and green light, or high, medium and low risks. </p>
<p Align=justify>Qualitative risk assessments are frequently favored because
they require less sophisticated risk aggregation methods, mathematical support
and user training, which means lower implementation costs. Conversely,
qualitative results are commonly criticized for their limited alignment with
key financial statement and budgetary indicators. Additionally, some critics
suggest qualitative results are generally more difficult to interpret, which
limits management's ability to assign accountability and remediate.&nbsp;</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>6. Time Horizon</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The issue: The time horizon of ERM risk assessment is largely
based on the organization's intent to use ERM risk results and its willingness
to invest in risk management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p Align=justify>Many companies use ERM results for quarterly or year-end
planning, while more sophisticated companies integrate ERM results into annual
budgeting and longer-term strategic planning processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p Align=justify>The shorter-term time horizon (less than 12 months) is
generally preferred as it requires less user training, provides increased risk
estimation accuracy and is generally less expensive than the longer-term
alternative. The longer-term solution is applied where management values risk
visibility beyond the annual financial reporting period and additional time to
remediate. Regardless of the approach, the risk assessment time horizon must be
consistent with intended ERM program objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>7. Multiple Potential Scenarios</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The issue:&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the following scenario: The ERM
team asks a respondent to assess the likelihood of counterparty default and its
subsequent loss impact during the current fiscal year. The respondent
determines that there is a 100% probability of at least one counterparty
default with a low financial impact over the defined time horizon (high
probability/low impact event). There is also a 5% probability of at least one
counterparty default with a significant financial impact (low probability/high
impact event) and several default scenarios with varying loss severity
estimates (moderate probability/moderate impact).&nbsp;</p>
<p Align=justify>This situation highlights an issue associated with basic risk
assessment methods most risks have multiple event likelihoods and risk
severities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>8. ERM Ownership</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The issue: The question regarding who should "own" ERM is
often unclear and commonly disputed at the board, audit committee and
management levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p Align=justify>While there is no one single industry practice with respect to
organization structure, ERM administration should generally be held by risk
management followed by internal audit, finance/treasury, legal and various
supporting departments (e.g., compliance, strategic planning).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>&nbsp;9. Risk Reporting</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The issue: Organizations often struggle with two risk
reporting issues: 1) what information should be shared with various internal
and external constituents, and 2) how should risk be
communicated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>10. Simulations and Stress Tests&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The issue: Stress tests allow management to assess the degree
that business operations may be negatively affected by prescribed events and
gauge the organization's ability to respond. While the concept is intuitive,
organizations often struggle to balance the need for meaningful simulation and
stress tests against a nearly infinite number of potential scenarios.
Similarly, organizations frequently struggle to identify and predict unknown or
unlikely risks (also known as black swans or game changers).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p Align=justify>All business institutions should have a vibrant risk culture.
A healthy risk culture gives employees a stake in risk management. Employees'
basic principles, values, and attitudes as well as their understanding of how
to deal with risk shape a company's risk culture. An appropriate risk culture
is necessary for corporate risk management procedures to work effectively
(www.rsmi.com). This requires that employees directly involved in internal
controls be fully aware of risks. For the company's internal control system to
fulfill its purpose, employees must operate within a well-established,
enterprise-wide risk culture. The tone at the top, the ethical atmosphere that
the organisation's leadership creates is fundamental. This is imperative for
all employees to become `risk aware' to evidence and ensure compliance (
<A HREF="http://www.safetrac.com" rel="nofollow">www.safetrac.com</A>). A risk aware culture
is required to support and pervade the work ethic. </p>

fundamental. But exemplary leadership does not automatically lead to an
effective risk culture, nor does it guarantee a properly functioning internal
control system. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Shaping risk culture</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Annual reports typically convey the impression that companies
have implemented effective risk management procedures. But risk culture is
often neglected as an integral part of corporate risk management. E. Schein
(1984) developed a model of corporate culture whereby, three elements determine
the risk culture of an enterprise: Basic assumptions, values, and artifacts and
creations.</p>
<p Align=justify>Basic assumptions are the foundation of corporate culture.
They are the invisible matters of organisational and environmental relations
that are commonly taken for granted. Employees' perceptions, thoughts, and
feelings about risks shape a company's risk culture.</p>
<p Align=justify>Values determine employees' moral and behavioural standards.
Principles, unwritten guidelines, and taboos that employees respect come from
these values. Often these values are only partially visible from employees'
outward conduct. </p>
<p Align=justify>Artifacts and creations are the tangible components of a
company's risk management system. They include a risk manual, a risk manager,
risk committee, published risk principles and guidelines, an IT-based risk
reporting system, and a printed risk report included in the annual report as
well as employee risk workshops. Such items are clearly visible and allow risk
managers to understand the existing risk culture of an enterprise. The presence
or absence of artifacts and creations enable managers to evaluate and shape the
company's risk culture.</p>
<p Align=justify>According to O. Bungartz,( 2010), a plan for shaping risk
culture in an enterprise should contain four steps; creating a team to lead the
process, evaluating the existing risk culture, determining what the desired
risk culture should look like and devising and implementing an action plan to
build the new risk culture.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Create a risk culture team</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Management should appoint a person independent of the
enterprise (possibly an external risk management consultant) to lead the risk
culture team. Members can include not only top management and the
risk-controlling department, but also board members and internal/ external
auditors.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Evaluate the Existing Culture</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Ultimately, employees should diagnose their company's risk
culture free of external forces imposing views on them. However, the members of
the risk culture team should be responsible for discovering the employees'
views on the existing risk culture and what it should become.</p>
<p Align=justify>The team should speak with all company employees so the entire
staff is sensitised to the risk-culture topic. Standardised and anonymous
questionnaires usually elicit more honest responses to questions about the
&#171;risk appetite&#187; of the company. The independent coordinator and the
members of the risk-culture team should prepare an analysis workshop for
selected upper management and cultural leaders to help uncover the invisible
basic assumptions that are fundamental to the enterprise's values. In addition
to the analysis workshop, the risk culture team should individually interview
each member of top management to promote high interactivity and frankness.
These interviews prompt senior managers to think deeply about the range of
possibilities for shaping a new risk culture. The members of the risk culture
team then conduct a critical review of the existing culture based on the
results of the enterprise-wide survey, the analysis workshop, and the
individual interviews (Oliver Bungartz, 2010).</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Determine Desired Risk Culture</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The profile of the target culture will be based on the same
factors that were used to evaluate the existing culture. Reorientation of the
company culture is possible only if there is a compelling reason and a shared
understanding of the need for cultural change among managers and employees. The
foremost goal of cultural reorientation is to sensitise every employee to the
necessity of conscious handling of corporate risks (Oliver Bungartz, 2010).</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Action Plan</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The fourth step in the risk culture programme is the
formulation of an actionable plan to realise the new cultural vision. Senior
management is responsible for implementing and monitoring this plan. New
orientation patterns are accompanied by new signals and formats as well as an
update of artifacts and creations. Securing &#171;buy in&#187; from employees
is crucial to the success of the action plan. They must know their input was
instrumental in creating new policies and that their continued involvement is
essential. Transparency and communication are key to making this happen. All
employees must understand that they each have a continuing role to play.
Management should reward risk sensitive behaviour that helps build the target
culture and dissuades unethical behaviour. Once the action plan begins to
initiate cultural change in the enterprise, it is common to see unanticipated
consequences. Erroneous trends (such as irritated employees or adverse cultural
developments) can surface that require monitoring and correction. A new risk
culture is vulnerable to undesired changes. Management must therefore
continuously observe and evaluate newly implemented risk-culture measures. The
figure overleaf summarises the factors and effects of an appropriate risk
culture (Oliver Bungartz, 2010).</p>

NAME="toc45"></A>2.6 Current trend of risk management</h2>

<p Align=justify>Over the past years, it was seen how events have altered the
perception of risk management, both inside and outside an organization. There
are three broad trends that have resulted from the exposure this area has had
recently: vertical transparency, a strengthening of risk cultures and data
control.</p>
<p Align=justify>Pressure on firms to prove the robustness of internal risk
controls and the perceived failure of the credit rating agencies are just two
of the factors that have driven an increase in the number of chief risk
officers in western world.&nbsp; This is particularly important as investors
are now demanding greater transparency to ensure that risk profiles are being
properly monitored.&nbsp; Vertical transparency within the institution is
therefore demanded since, as this external messaging is the responsibility of
the board, the CRO requires clear bilateral communication between them
(http://blogs.sungard.com).</p>
<p Align=justify>It's also been crucial to strengthen the risk culture right
across an institution.&nbsp; Metrics produced by the risk management function
need to be used in the decision-making process all across the trading
floor.&nbsp; This is vital for two reasons.&nbsp; First, limits tend to be set
centrally, with an enterprise view in mind, whereas a trader has local limits
with little or no enterprise-wide visibility. The second reason is related to
the efficiency of the calculations. Exposing the methods and data used as well
as the outputs from the risk process allows traders to see that the correct
parameters were employed.&nbsp; This removes objections to risk related
decisions and further allows traders to understand the backdrop to the risk
limitation process. </p>
<p Align=justify> (http://blogs.sungard.com)</p>
<p Align=justify>Data control was long seen as the cornerstone of the risk
management process has now taken on an even greater level of importance.&nbsp;
Recent market events have created a skewed set of correlated, downward sloping
data that will take a while to work through the system.&nbsp; The effect of
this is that close attention has to be paid to the input data and historical
stress scenarios.&nbsp; Multiple data sets are likely to be needed in order to
capture risks appropriate for both current and future states.
(http://blogs.sungard.com)</p>
<p Align=justify>The emphasis on risk management has moved from increasing
product complexity towards more fundamental concerns. This change of focus has
gone a long way to helping ensure that there is no repeat show.</p>

technology and financial parts of most businesses. Within liquidity risk, there
are three main areas:</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Funding Risks</strong>: Funding risk means that the
business does not have enough cash to run the business. This is a huge worry
for anyone within risk management. Funding liquidity risk can affect how well

<p Align=justify><strong>Market Risks</strong>: Market risk usually comes in
the form of items within a portfolio, items that can't ever be sold, or
products that can't be sold in the market for their stated worth. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Counter party Risks</strong>: Counter party risk can
almost be considered consumer-driven in many cases. For example, if your client
stops paying you for something that they've bought, they have not fulfilled
their obligations to you. With the recent crisis of late, companies have had to
really consider these emerging risk management trends and implement risk
policies. It has to become part of their overall business strategy in order to
thrive in the new and more challenging environments of today

Introduction</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>This chapter presents methodology describing how the study was
conducted. It includes; research design, Study population, sample and sample
size, methods of data collection, methods of data analysis and anticipation of
the study.</p>
<p Align=justify>Research methodology refers to a philosophy of research
process. It includes the assumptions and values that serve a rationale for
research and the standards or criteria the researcher uses for collecting and
interpreting data and reaching at conclusions (Martin and Amin, 2005:63). In
other words research methodology determines the factors such as how to write
hypothesis and what level of evidence is necessary to make decisions on whether
to accept or reject the hypothesis.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc305766952"></A><A NAME="toc48"></A>3.1. Study area</h2>

<p Align=justify>This study was carried out in a private business company
dealing with house and road construction and electrical ware repair. It is
located in Kigali City in Rwanda, precisely in Nyarugenge District. It employs
101 staff.</p>

<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc288832657"></A><A NAME="_Toc305766953"></A><A
NAME="toc49"></A>3.2. Research design</h2>

<p Align=justify>A research design represents a plan of how particular study
should be conducted. It is concerned with the type of data that will be
collected and the means used to obtain them (Nieswiadomy; 1993). (Oswala E.C,
2001:52) refer to research design as the overall plan to use and follow in
answering the research questions. Thus it involves deciding on what type of
research questions to use and the answers to them while considering the best
way to gather data required for the study. This is a case study research. This
refers to a method based on an in-depth investigation of a single individual,
group, or phenomenon (Robert K. Yin: 2009). The researcher also used
triangulation of both quantitative and qualitative research methods for
collecting and analyzing data to describe and interpret it into information.
</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc288832658"></A><A NAME="_Toc299713942"></A><A
NAME="_Toc305766954"></A><A NAME="toc50"></A>3.3. Study population </h2>

<p Align=justify>A research study population is also known as a well-defined
collection of individuals or objects known to have similar characteristics.
(Oswala E.C, 2001:55) refer to population as the number of persons or objects
covered by the study or with which the study is concerned. In other words, it
is a set of people or items under consideration in a study.  In this research,
all employees of the EKJ&amp;CIE form the research population through which the
sample was drawn from. The total population number was 105 employees among
which four of them were top managers.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc288832659"></A><A NAME="_Toc299713943"></A><A
NAME="_Toc305766955"></A><A NAME="toc51"></A>3.4. Sample and Sample size</h2>

<p Align=justify>A sample is a small group of cases drawn from and used to
represent the large group or whole population under investigation. Therefore
sample size is the number of people or objects in the selected sample (Manheim
JB and Rich, 1999:448).</p>
<p Align=justify>Sampling is the process of selecting elements from the total
population in such a way that the sample elements selected represent the total
population. Thus in research the sample should be a representation of the total
population such that as much as possible, most characteristics of the
population should be represented in the sample selected (Martin, E. Amin
2005:67). The researcher used two different samples according to the required
data related to the objectives of the study. On one hand, the researcher
purposively chose two of the top managers for interview in order to collect
information related to the risk management plans used, challenges they face and
the current trend of risk management. Any manager who would be available
especially the risk operation manager was considered. On the other hand, the
researcher made another sample drawn from the rest of employees from which he
intended to get information related to the employees' awareness on risk
management. This information was obtained from a distributed questionnaire to
that sample which was obtained from this formula below:</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>n=N/1+N(e)<sup>2</sup></strong><sup> </sup>
whereby:</p>
<p Align=justify>n= sample size; N= population; e= the level of precision.</p>
<p Align=justify>The confidence interval or margin of error is 10% or .1 where
as the confidence level is 90%</p>
<p Align=justify>N= 101 e= 10% or 0.1  n= 101/1+ 101(0.1)<sup>2</sup>= 50.2
cases/respondents</p>
<p Align=justify>To get that sample, the researcher had a list of all employees
arranged in alphabetical order excluding 4 top managers. A systematic sampling
method was used whereby a starting number was randomly chosen then an interval
was determined by N/n=K. It is 101/50=2<br>the starting number was randomly
chosen between 1 and 2, then each K+1 was picked up until all 50 names were
found.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc305766956"></A><A NAME="toc52"></A>3.5. Research tools</h2>

<p Align=justify>These are means of gathering information, which includes
receiving, retrieving, accessing, abstracting, and extracting information from
information sources.</p>
<p Align=justify>During this research study, Data were collected using the
following techniques; questionnaire, interview and observation approaches. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Questionnaire technique: </strong>This is a set of
written questions that is given to a number of respondents in order to collect
information. The questionnaire comprised of both open and closed ended
questions. The researcher used this technique in order to collect data from
ordinary employees on their awareness on risk management. <strong> </strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Interview technique: </strong>this refers to a
conversation through which a researcher interviews a person to get appropriate
information in relation to the study. In this particular study, the researcher
interviewed two administration managers of EKJ&amp;CIE in order to get
information related to the risk management plans used, challenges and the
current trend of risk management in EKJ&amp;CIE.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Observation</strong>: This is a process of using
necked eye to carefully watching phenomena for a period of time. This technique
helped the researcher on field when collecting data regarding risk prevention
in assessing whether technicians wear personal protective equipments at
work.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc299713945"></A><A NAME="_Toc305766957"></A><A
NAME="toc53"></A>3.6. Data analysis<br></h2>

<p Align=justify>This is a process of turning data into information; the
process of reviewing, summarizing, and organizing isolated facts (data) such
that they formulate a meaningful response to a research question.</p>
<p Align=justify>To analyse and interpret data into information, the researcher
used qualitative analysis by grouping interview responses according to research
objectives, then, tables and corresponding charts were used to enable the
researcher to analyse quantitative data obtained from questionnaire results.
</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc305766958"></A><A NAME="toc54"></A>3.7 Ethical
considerations</h2>

<p Align=justify>These are variously defined and differentiated; as, for
example, a series of obligations to society which all researchers must
fulfil.</p>
<p Align=justify>In our study, respondents were made aware of the ethical
responsibilities. Participants were informed that participation was voluntary
and they could withdraw from the study at any time without any consequences.
All participants were treated with respect and dignity and they remained
anonymous throughout the study. Respondents were explained the purpose of
research and were assured that their answers would be kept confidential.</p>

<p Align=justify>Also, the reason as to why males out number females is that,
in Rwanda, males tend to study engineering related courses than females, and
therefore have more chances of being employed than females. It means that males
are more influential than females in all matters regarding their activities
thus the female contribution may be little for instance while planning for risk
management, the campany may set only those set by men thus women related risks
may be neglected. </p>

the distribution of respondents according to their age groups. Generally, 35
emloyees which are 70% are between 20 and 29 years of age, followed by 9
employees or 18% who are  between  30 and 39 years of age. Those aged between
40 and 49 are 6 or 12 % of respondents while nobody above 50 years or below 20
years of age.</p>
<p Align=justify>This explains how the company employs young aged personnel
mainly because its main works are technical and require physical fitness and
agility.</p>

<p Align=justify>As far as risk management is concerned, this age distribution
on one hand has a positive impact on the company in the way that young people
are the ones fit to perform energy requiring activities such as construction
works and are less exposed to work related deseases such as low back pains etc.
again as the majority are below 30 years of age, the campany has great
opportunity to employ them for long time which may be good for the management
to use less money for new recruitments and medical expences because normally
people of this age group do not fall sick frequently compared to older people.
On the other hand, this age distribution may play a negative impact on the
company in the way that this group may be the one with little job experience
which expose them to incidents/accidents risks more than older employees,
furthermore this may also affect the overall quality of the company's work. If
not controlled, this group (20-29) may tend to negliget the use personal
protective equipments because they feel capable to work with much agility and
speed but this may expose them to minor as well as major injuries which may
cause a huge loss of human resources, financial and reputation to the company.

<p Align=justify>The table 4.1.3 above and coresponding pie chart below show
the distribution of education among respondents. No illeterate respondent, 22%
have a primary education level, 38% have a secondary level, 24% with advanced
diploma while 16% have  bachelor degree and above.</p>
<p Align=justify>This distribution shows a positive thing whereby no illiterate
personel employed by the company which is good for the company management in
relation with risk management because every body is able to read the campany's
manual of internal rules and regulations and can report any incident through
writing to the management.</p>

<p Align=justify>Again, it is easy to train all employees especially in local
language if all of them cannot understand and well speak english. Once the
administration  has risk manmagement plans, it will be easy for it to train
employees eventhough those with primary education still lack some knowledge but
at least have a certain level of basic education.</p>
<p Align=justify>It is easier to them to cope with challenges and if trained on
risk management, their level of awareness will vary but not as much as training
illeterate people.</p>

<p Align=justify>The table 4.1.4 above and chart 4.1.4 below indicate the
distribution of respondents in relation with their marital status. Among
respondents, 66% were single, 32% were married, 2% are widow, no separation or
divorce. This means that one one hand, the company is likely to have problems
in matters of employee retention because the majority of them are single and
this category is not stable at work as they keep searching for green pastures.
On the other hand, only 2% are widow(er) and there are no divorce or
separation. This is an advantage for the company because there might be less
psychological problems related to marriages etc. which means less hours lost on
such problems. Again, 32% are married which means that these people have a
focus while working, this is a positive point on the company because this
category of people is likely to be prudent on work and avoid hazardious and
dangerous actions which may cause injuries and deaths to them as they are other
responsibilities at home more than their fellow single employees.</p>

<p Align=justify>As far as risk management is concerned, married people are
more cautious than singles which may on one hand limit the quality of work if
needs some risky ingeniousity and on the other hand, it helps the company to
avoid risks related to precipited works and more people have other
responsibilities, more they learn rules and regulations, policies, procedures
and guidelines to follow in order to perform work correctly. Married employees
are more ethical than unmarried ones while single employees are the ones likely
to steal the company or do not comply with regulations. In matters related to
risk awareness, there is no evidence stating whether any category may be aware
more than another.</p>

<p Align=justify>As far as risk management is concerned, majority of them are
technicians because of the nature of the campany's work. These are more exposed
to physical injuries at the field work than their fellow administrators and
cleaners which means they need personal protective equipments and need more
trainings in prevention of risks and accidents at work more than other
categories of employees. Administrators on the other side need trainings in
financial risk management and human resource management. All of them need to be
informed on risk management whereby each category need to be trained in risks
related to the nature of their works.</p>

employees are more experienced on their jobs are also experienced with
potential risks thy are likely to encounter like falls, burns, electrocution
etc.</p>

<p Align=justify>These people are coutious at work and have less risks of being
injured than less experienced employees. Again, experienced personel know
better rules and regulations than new comers on job and this is a good point on
behalf of the company. However, less experienced employees have difficulty to
comply with work lawas.</p>
<p Align=justify>According to the figures shown, it is abvious that a high
number of respondents (46%) have between one and five years of experience which
means they need more traings on risk management than those with a lot of

is a good point for the company as it tries to train its employees. The
remaining should also be trained as well, as every body has a risk at some
degrees. Employees will be better informed and may reach to good achievements
such as business plans, appropriate schedules and budgets, increased likelihood
of business growth, proper allocation of risk, identification of best risk

<p Align=justify>These answers show that a high number is likely to meet
physical risks which is because of the nature of work whereby majority are
technicians on field working in construction and electricity. However another
high number including the same technicians also face risks related to
technology, these risks vary according to the nature or type of work,
administrators/financials face money fraud using high technology which may
cause a huge loss to the company, engineers and technicians face technological
risks.  Other few numbers face financial, political ,security risks while 6%
reported to face all kind of risks.</p>
<p Align=justify>As these results show, there is a need of appropriate personal
protective equipments in order to minimize risks of injuries and deaths of
employees. Also, it is of paramount importance for the company to properly use
the information technology in data management and buy modern materials used in
construction and electrical related activities and train employees to use them.
This will reduce these risks which were mentioned by a high number.</p>
<p Align=justify>Security and political risks are not the least problems
because if security is not enough, nothing can be operational, theft issues can
cause loss of properties etc. that is why the management should consider all
these factors. </p>

<p Align=justify>The table and pie chart 4.1.9 show that among respondents, 62%
have had training on risks related to which the respondent is likely to
encounter while 38% did not have it. This shows a big gap in training in this
company which may hinder its growth. But, it may be caused probably by the
newness of a big number of employees or lack of structured training plan within
the campany. When employees are not trained, they are likely to meet those
risks and will not be able to manage them accordingly. This may cause  huge
financial expenses to the company while training would cost less and minimise
risk occurences. Again, it is a lot of benefits to the dcompany when employees
are aware of possible risks they may encounter while on work. This enable them
to take appropriate measures especially for prevention and/or foer mitigation
which is a double advantage on both employees and the company's management.</p>

to handle them, while on the side of the management, they spend less money on
risks because a lot of them are preventable and the company creates a good
reputation when its employees work in a good environment. That is why the

<p Align=justify>Even though a half of issues were well managed, this is not
enough in risk management because 11% which report that they were not managed
all may cause a serious problem to the company including financial loss,
injuries and/ or deaths to the human resources, theft, and loss of reputation
and yet this could have been prevented before.</p>
<p Align=justify>In other words, the company should set a strong risk
management plan including all phases namely; risk identification whereby no
stone should be left behind, risk quantification and analysis, risk response
and risk monitoring and control. This plan will help the company to manage
almost all risks with fewer costs compared to expenses used on a surprised
issue.</p>

<p Align=justify>The table and corresponding chart above show that 44 or 88% of
respondents needed protective equipment while 12%  do not need it. This is true
because in construction and electrical repair areas, the technician shhould
wear personal protective equipment (PPE). The purpose of personal protective
equipment is to protect the body from various injuries resulting, for example,
from mechanical, chemical, and thermal hazards. Protective equipment should not
be worn just at the moment of interacting with hazard, but rather personal
protective equipment should be worn long before the employee is going to come
into contact with hazard.</p>

<p Align=justify>According to safety standards, the exterior of construction
sites shall be barricaded with construction fencing, chain link fencing or
warning tape. Inside, signs shall be posted conspicuously particularly on
restricted areas. Also, there should be signs indicating the kind of PPE to
wear when entering specific areas. Amongst the most common PPE needed when
entering construction sites are, hard hats, safety glasses, long trousers,
safety vest, and steel toe boots. These PPE should be worn at all times when
inside the construction area. When the working elevation is high, the
appropriate fall protection gear should be used.</p>
<p Align=justify>It should be recalled to all technicians that the use of PPE
will eventually help them. It saves life. A construction worker utilizing
complete PPE will be greatly shielded against common mishaps that happen in
their workplace. It can also lessen the risks of serious injury or even death.
That is why the company should avail adequate PPE, train all employees on how
they are used and when and make it the use of PPE a policy among other policies
governing the company.</p>

<p Align=justify>This is a threat to employees using defective PPE which means
they are exposed to injuries at work. That is why the company should provide
suitable PPE to all employees and set a policy which states clearly on that
with clear responsibilities to technicians such as to attend and comply with
training, instruction and information, to check the condition of their PPE , to
store, clean and maintain their PPE and to report losses, defects or other
problems with PPE and to their supervisorsupervisors such as to ensure adequate
information and training is provided to those who require PPE, to ensure that
PPE is properly stored, maintained, cleaned, repaired and replaced when
necessary because without proper maintenance, protective equipment will not be

to the company. However, it is abvious that there are no risk management plans
in the company, which is a big handicap for its management. RMP should be

enjoy benefits like to provide an assurance that the company/organization has

these. To ensure that the company/organisation's business planning processes

<p Align=justify>The table and graph 4.1.17 indicate that all respondents
(100%) know that they are insured. This indicate a great performance on the
side of the company because insurance is one of risk response type whereby
injured or sick employees may get treated  or compansatedwith less costs on
behalf of the company and the employee. Health insurance is a subject that
assumes great relevance and importance in these times.&nbsp; Making ends meet
is a struggle in itself but not having the means to get a health insurance
would be like committing a big financial mistake.&nbsp; The risk involved is
losing all the savings in the bank account to counter a sudden medical
emergency.&nbsp; Which is why buying a health insurance makes complete sense
for the employer and for the employee.</p>

<p Align=justify>The interview results above are related to the first objective
whereby the researcher wanted to identify risk management plans used in
EKJ&amp;CIE. According to both interviewee answers, the company has neither
written risk management plans nor risk management officer. However, both
interviewees understand the benefits of having risk management system in the
business whereby both state that benefits vary from identifying potential
risks, preventing them to risk treatment. Nobody mentioned regular monitoring
and control. Nevertheless, it is obvious that respondents have good ideas on
risk management plan even though; it is not formally structured and documented
in the company management system. But, the fact of having idea on risk
management plans and their benefits is not enough alone, there should be a
formal way of doing things, each employee should adhere too if the company
wants to grow with time and hire a risk management officer because, risk
management is particularly vital for any business especially private
businesses, since some common types of losses such as theft, fire, flood, legal
liability, injury, or disability can destroy in a few minutes what may have
taken entrepreneur years to build. Such losses and liabilities can affect day
to day operations, reduce profits, and cause financial hardship severe enough
to cripple or bankrupt the business. EKJ&amp;CIE management should employ a
full time risk manager to identify risks and take the necessary steps to
protect the firm against risks otherwise; the responsibility for risk
management is likely to fall on the business owner.</p>

<p Align=justify>According to the question asking how the management identify
potential risk that the company may be victim of, both respondents agree that
there is no formal way of doing it, but when there is an imminent problem, the
management sits together and try to find out solution. As we know risk
management is proactive and not reactive that is why they current way of
identifying risks in EKJ&amp;CIE is not proper, there is a high probability of
being surprised by uncertain and harmful events to the business because these
were not investigated by qualified people on time. Therefore, there should be a
risk management system through which all possible risks are identified via
brainstorming for instance, categorized and prioritised. Potential risk
exposures are quantified and risk mitigation plans are planned for each
specific risk.</p>
<p Align=justify>Asking on how the company deals with health and safety to
employees, they all mentioned the provision of PPE, insurance and trainings on
protection against injuries. </p>
<p Align=justify>All workers have a right to work in places where risks to
their health and safety are properly controlled. Health and safety is about
stopping the employee getting hurt at work or ill through work. The employer is
responsible for health and safety. Again insuring employees is a responsibility
from the employer which is positive.</p>
<p Align=justify>On how the company controls the company financials, they have
accountants; they carry out internal and external auditing and regular
monitoring of ins and outs using information technology. Normally, financial
risks arise from some sources; from the organization's exposure to changes in
market prices, such as interest rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices,
Financial risks arising from the actions of, and transactions with other
organizations such as vendors, customers, and counterparties in derivatives
transactions and financial risks resulting from internal actions or failures of
the organization, particularly people, processes, and systems. The company is
advised to diversify its activities as one of financial risk management
process. Diversification among counterparties may reduce the risk that
unexpected events adversely impact the organization through defaults.
Diversification among investment assets reduces the magnitude of loss if one
issuer fails. Diversification of customers, suppliers, and financing sources
reduces the possibility that an organization will have its business adversely
affected by changes outside management's control. Although the risk of loss
still exists, diversification may reduce the opportunity for large adverse
outcomes. The company has internal rules and regulations but does not have
incident reporting system which normally serves as a way of reporting any
incident or accident happened at work and find out solutions and preventive
measures in the future.</p>

high competition with bigger companies that perform similar works, changing
technology, theft, injuries to employees, financial loss etc. To know whether
the company is technologically and physically secure; no one disagreed or
agreed, there probable technological insecurity but the company is not under

<p Align=justify><br>This chapter presents the summary of the findings,
conclusions and recommendations regarding the study carried out on risk
management in private institutions using a case study of EKJ&amp;CIE
enterprise. The important findings of this study are outlined in this chapter.
Finally, recommendations are provided based on the findings of this study.</p>

findings</h2>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc299713954"></A><A NAME="_Toc305693572"></A><A
NAME="_Toc305694206"></A><A NAME="_Toc305694603"></A><A
NAME="_Toc305766124"></A><A NAME="_Toc305766967"></A><A NAME="toc99"></A>The
overall aim of this study was to find out how risk management is carried out in
EKJ&amp;CIE. Furthermore, the study explored whether this enterprise has
structured risk management plans how it identifies and treats risks, which
challenges it meets while performing risk management and assessed the level of
employees' awareness in relation with risk management.</h2>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc299713955"></A><A NAME="_Toc305766968"></A><A
NAME="toc100"></A>5.1.1 Risk management plans </h2>

<p Align=justify>Results from both interviewees show that there are no
structured  and written risk management plans but still employees have some
knowledge about risk  as confirmed by both interviewees, every employee gets
some trainings on risks related to his/her domain of work but these are still
insufficient compared to what should be done. </p>
<p Align=justify>Even though, the enterprise does not have formal risk
management plans which state how it should identify, quantify, treat, monitor
and control risks, we cannot conclude that risk is meaningless to this company
rather they feel it but need trainings on risk management so that the
management can establish a strong risk management plan and get all related
benefits.  </p>
<p Align=justify>Both interviewees confirmed the absence of risk management
officer but mentioned some positive activities performed within the company
which relate much with risk management such as the action of being aware of
risks that face the enterprise such as high competition, money theft, injuries
and death of employees working in electrical and building domains, financial
loss, loss of data among others. Again both have knowledge on benefits of
having risk management plans whereby both mentioned like:</p>
<p Align=justify>1. Prevention of  financial losses</p>
<p Align=justify>2.  Avoiding hazardous works, government penalties related to
not paying taxes on time</p>
<p Align=justify>3. Avoid money theft</p>
<p Align=justify>4.  Employee retention  </p>
<p Align=justify>5.  Appropriate allocation of resources,</p>
<p Align=justify>6.  Good management of money,</p>
<p Align=justify>7.  Prevention of theft, </p>
<p Align=justify>8. Prevention of staff injuries and deaths etc </p>
<p Align=justify>This statement goes hand in hand with other literatures which
state some common benefits as those above mentioned (Newland K.E.1997)</p>
<p Align=justify>It was observed that the company has weakness in identifying
risks where as both interviewees stated that there is no regular way of
identifying risks unless there is a tangible risk that the company is likely to
encounter soon. Literatures state that Management of risk is an integral part
of good business practice and quality management. Learning how to manage risk
effectively enables managers to improve outcomes by identifying and analysing
the wider range of issues and providing a systematic way to make informed
decisions. A structured risk management approach also enhances and encourages
the identification of greater opportunities for continuous improvement through
innovation (

<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc299713956"></A><A NAME="_Toc305766969"></A><A
NAME="toc101"></A>5.1.2 Challenges to risk management</h2>

<p Align=justify>The company face a number of challenges which range from
financial to health related but as said above they are neither quantified nor
communicated formally as it should be in the formal way of risk management.
These challenges are mainly:</p>
<p Align=justify>1. Theft of data</p>
<p Align=justify>2. High competition of similar companies which have updated
technologies,</p>
<p Align=justify>3.  High financial means to compete for bigger works, </p>
<p Align=justify>4. Safety related risks for technicians who work in
electricity domain who can be electro shocked while repairing wires, </p>
<p Align=justify>5. Injuries due to high fall from building of technicians
etc.</p>
<p Align=justify>To overcome these challenges, a strong data control system
should be put in place, revise business plans of the company, train all
employees on risks they are facing in their regular works and provide high
quality protective equipment to any employee/technician in need.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc299713957"></A><A NAME="_Toc305766970"></A><A
NAME="toc102"></A>5.1.3 Trends of risk management</h2>

<p Align=justify>Both respondents had positive plans regarding the future of
risk management in the company but did not explain in terms of time and effort
to be invested in order to hire the chief risk manager who will help the
company to make the system operational. However, they are planning to hire a
consultant to make it more clear which is a green light to the installation of
the system in the near future. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>5.1.4 Employee's awareness on risk
management</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>These results respond to the question asking the level of
awareness of EKJ&amp;CIE employees in relation with risk management.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Demographic data of respondents</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Results show that the majority of employees were males and
aged below 30 years of age and majority are single. On education basis a half
of them have secondary diploma and advanced degree, this is probably due to the
nature of their work of technicians which do not require higher qualifications
rather vocational skills and physical fitness which explains the supremacy of
males, young age of the majority of these employees and this explains the
reason why many of them are single and have less job experience as 80% of
respondents are between less than a year and five years of experience.</p>
<p Align=justify>Respondents showed indirectly that they are aware of risks and
ways of risk management whereby: 92% of respondents confirmed to have had
trainings related to risk management, 84% and 80% expressed their concern about
physical and technological risks they were likely to meet during their day to
day jobs, 74% had been once at risk which could put their life in danger and
rated the level of satisfaction on how that threatening risk was managed.</p>
<p Align=justify>Also, respondents demonstrated their need of protective
equipment by 88% but this number dropped to nearly 57% with no convincing
reasons as the management confirmed their existence, probably this drop was due
to the quality of these protective materials as expressed by respondents
whereby only 68% appreciated their status as good while 32% rated them as not
good. This drop may be explained by the fact that probably those with poor
quality equipment are the ones who do not use them.</p>
<p Align=justify>Respondents admitted by 72% that they don't know whether there
are risk management plans within the company but, nearly the same percentage
confirmed the existence of rules and regulations that govern the company. This
shows some lack of communication between the top management and on ground staff
concerning administration issues or negligence on part of technicians. </p>
<p Align=justify>All respondents (100%) know that they are insured in Rwanda
Social Security Fund and have health insurance which helps them to pay less
when they are sick or their close relatives. This is a positive point either on
their behalf but on the side of the company management too because it is a
motivating factor is among employee retention factors too. </p>
<p Align=justify>Finally, respondents gave advises to the employer summarised
into: </p>
<p Align=justify>1. Keep insuring employees</p>
<p Align=justify>2. Buy updated equipments</p>
<p Align=justify>3. Improve the use of IT</p>
<p Align=justify>4. Regular trainings in Risk management</p>
<p Align=justify>5. Trainings in financial management</p>
<p Align=justify>6. Trainings in Health and Safety</p>
<p Align=justify>7. Training in each respondent's domain</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc299713958"></A><A NAME="_Toc305766971"></A><A
NAME="toc103"></A>5.2 Conclusion</h2>

<p Align=justify>The importance of risk management in projects can hardly be
overstated. Awareness of risk has increased as we currently live in a less
stable economic and political environment.</p>
<p Align=justify>Making a sound business case for having a strong risk
management program has long been an elusive challenge for many organizations.
The question still remains unanswered, &#171;How much value should be placed on
preventing loss from a disaster that might never happen?&#187;&nbsp; However it
is generally agreed that the consequences of risk management failure can be
dire. There is a clear imperative for many companies to develop a strong,
consistent, enterprise wide risk management programme, as most prevalent
business risks will either remain at current levels or increase.</p>
<p Align=justify>In pursuing this goal, companies, now more than ever, would do
well to begin by identifying their top drivers, then pinpointing the top
threats to those revenue drivers, and distinguishing between those that are
predominantly downside risks and those that are predominantly variable
risks.</p>
<p Align=justify>While both categories of risk deserve attention, companies may
discover the effectiveness of their risk management programs are most effective
if they devote more of their attention to controlling risk rather than
transferring it to insurance companies. And the risks that can be most directly
controlled are downside risks, the very risks that are most likely to threaten
company's top revenue drivers. When downside risks are dealt with first through
prevention and control, it enables senior management to deal more aggressively
with variable risks. In short they become more proactive and strategic with
their risk management approach.</p>
<p Align=justify>Because companies indicate that they expect having trouble
finding the time, budget and people necessary to implement or maintain a strong
risk management program, senior management must demonstrate leadership in
championing and funding this initiative. The number one consequence of poor
risk management is loss of competitiveness.</p>
<p Align=justify>By implementing an effective risk management program,
companies protect their ability to compete. Nothing is more fundamental to
business success.</p>
<p Align=left><strong><A NAME="_Toc299713959"></A>5.3
Recommendations</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>From observation, interviews carried out and questionnaire
launched among respondents, the researcher advises the following
recommendations:</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>To EKJ&amp;CIE Management</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>1. There should be recruitment of chief risk officer within
the enterprise</p>
<p Align=justify>2. There is a need of regular trainings on risk management at
each level of employees</p>
<p Align=justify>3. The company should purchase high quality and enough
protective equipment</p>
<p Align=justify>4. There is a need to improve the ways of communication within
the enterprise</p>
<p Align=justify>5. The employer should keep the culture of  insuring
employees</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>To the Government of Rwanda </strong></p>
<p Align=justify>1. The government should sensitise private businesses on the
importance of risk management</p>
<p Align=justify>2. The government should provide to private businesses more
workshops on risk management.</p>

<p Align=justify><strong>Appendix D: Interview answers</strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Interview1.</strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>NB: T</em>he interviewee wished not to mention his
post and name that is why he was nicknamed Respondent<sub>1</sub>
(R<sub>1</sub>) in answers he gave below.</strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q1: Do you have Risk management plans which are
operational?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>1</sub></strong>: Thank you very much for the
question; the company does not have written risk management plans but it
organizes different trainings about risks in relation with types of works done
by the company in financial management, electrical and in construction. </p>
<p Align=justify><br><strong><em>Q2: Does the institution have Risk management
officer?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>1</sub></strong>:  No, the company does not have
a risk management officer until now but as it is continuing to grow, but surely
we will have this post in the near future.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q3: What do you think are the benefits of having a
Risk Management Plan?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>1</sub>: </strong>Ok, as it is called Risk plan,
it means it helps the enterprise to identify earlier negative events which may
kill the business and find out how these can be sorted out, any way that is my
idea on risk management!</p>
<p Align=justify>As i was saying, the benefits of having risk management plan
are many including preventing financial losses, avoiding hazardous works,
avoiding government penalties related to not paying taxes on time for instance,
avoid money theft, employees retention etc.   </p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q4: What potential risks does your company
face?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>1</sub></strong>: thank you for such question;
by the way risks are there and sometimes you can avoid them, on our concern,
our company faces risks especially, high competition of similar companies which
have updated technologies, high financial means to compete for bigger works,
risk of theft of data, loss from delayed pays from clients, safety related
risks for technicians who work in electricity domain who can be electro shocked
while repairing wires, injuries due to high fall from building of technicians
etc.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q5: How does the company deal with health and
safety of employees?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>1</sub></strong>: The company deals with health
and safety by availing helmets to builders, gloves and appropriate shoes and
aprons to staff working on building sites and repairing electrical wires and
everybody has health insurance,  i guess we have tried to comply with national
policies on this issue and we do this so that our employees be in good working
environment and we make sure they do not export they do not go with acquired
experience elsewhere think it is another sort of motivation on their part too
.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q6: How do you control the company's
financials?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>1</sub></strong>: The Company's financials are
controlled in the way that we have two accountants and there is internal
auditing done each year.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q7: How does your company identify and treat
risk?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>1</sub></strong>: Ah! As I said earlier, we do
not have structured risk management plan probably because this issue seems to
be new in traditional business and i think there are no many qualified people
in this domain because actually they are not common. So on our part, we have no
formal way to do that but we try to solve risks which seem to materialise soon
(you know?) by sitting together especially managers and heads of technicians
and try to sort it out before it harms our business but this is not regularly
done i wish it would be. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q8: Does the institution have rules and
regulations/Guidelines that all employees have to comply</em></strong>
<strong><em>with?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>1</sub></strong>: Yes, the company has internal
rules and regulations that every employee must follow on while on duty and
these are communicated each new employee.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q9: Does the institution have a problem/incident
reporting system?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>1</sub></strong>: Not yet but we aspire to have
it.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q10: Is your institution technologically and
physically secure?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>1</sub></strong>: Probably, because it has well
built office and we have competent administration staff but, you never know as
we are connected to the worldwide through internet, we are not totally secure
technologically as even great state institutions in Europe and USA are exposed
to theft by hackers.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q11: Do your employees get regular trainings on
Risk management?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>1</sub></strong>: Ok, there are not regular but
we try our best such that each employee gets training on risks related to his
work for instance: data protection for financial workers, engineering related
accidents etc. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q12: Do they have personal protective
equipments?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>1</sub></strong>: Yes, they wear protective
equipments and we try to avail those with good quality even though they are
expensive.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q13: What is the future of risk management in your
company?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>1</sub></strong>: We are going to put emphasis
on it as far as we get qualified people in that domain because we are realizing
its importance in business, it will depend on decisions made by the management
meeting but i am sure we are obliged to do so because as far as the world is
pushing forward, business risks are also increasing and with high competition
we have to identify all those risks so that we can seek adequate solutions
which will enable us to push forward within all those difficulties.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q14: Do you have anything else you might like to
add, specifically related to the topic discussed on or anything else? 
</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>1</sub></strong>: First of all i wish that the
Private Sector Federation (PSF) sensitise and train enterprises on risk
management, IT usage and more workshops in accountancy and administration and
thank you for this moment we shared together.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Interview2.</strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>NB: T</em>he interviewee is the administration
manager and he was nicknamed Respondent<sub>2</sub> (R<sub>2</sub>) in the
interview below.</strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q1: Do you have Risk management plans which are
operational?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>2</sub>):</strong> Oh not yet but it does not
mean that Risks are not considered seriously in our business company, but as
you know in business things do not grow in one day or one year, it takes time
and money, we hire people to train our staff but we hope to hire a consultant
for that if things positively go on. </p>
<p Align=justify><br><strong><em>Q2: Does the institution have Risk management
officer?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>2</sub></strong>This staff did not exist before
but i think he/she will be the one in charge of risk management plans once
established.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q3: What do you think are the benefits of having a
Risk Management Plan?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>2</sub></strong>Oops, there are many ranging
from the appropriate allocation of resources, good management of money,
prevention of theft, staff injuries, why not deaths and so on. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q4: What potential risks does your company
face?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>2</sub>:</strong> Financial loss, desertion of
qualified employees, injuries and death of technicians, equipment damage,
business collapse etc.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q5: How does the company deal with health and
safety of employees?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>2</sub>:</strong> We make sure every technician
has equipment for protection, we train them how to protect against injuries and
everyone has health insurance.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q6: How do you control the company's
financials?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>2</sub>:</strong> We get audited by external
auditing firm, we have good account unit and we try to monitor our ins and outs
using the information technology.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q7: How does your company identify and treat
risk?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>2</sub>: </strong>Normally, the company does not
have a regular way of doing such things but when there is an obvious risk we
are seeing in front, we as managers sit together and find out means with which
we can prevent the occurrence. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q8: Does the institution have rules and
regulations/Guidelines that all employees have to comply</em></strong>
<strong><em>with?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>2</sub>: </strong>Absolutely, we have them and
everyone has to be informed about</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q9: Does the institution have a problem/incident
reporting system?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>2</sub></strong>: No we don't.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q10: Is your institution technologically and
physically secure?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>2</sub>:</strong> Not totally but we are not
under high threat, we try by all means to keep the business as safe as
possible.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q11: Do your employees get regular trainings on
Risk management?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>2</sub>:</strong>well, we try our best so that
an employee gets some knowledge of possible risks he/she may encounter in
his/her daily work and sometimes we benefit it from the Private Sector
Federation.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q12: Do they have personal protective
equipments?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>2</sub>: </strong>All we try is to keep the
staff safe and healthy; we try our best and avail appropriate equipments to our
technicians like plastic gloves, plastic boots, glasses and aprons.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q13: What is the future of risk management in your
company?</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>2</sub>: </strong>Well, as means will be
available, we shall hire a consultant to explain at large the role of risk
management and within sometime i cannot precise; we will have a strong risk
management system.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong><em>Q14: Do you have anything else you might like to
add, specifically related to the topic discussed on or anything else? 
</em></strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>R<sub>2</sub>: </strong>I say thank you for this great
moment we shared.</p>
