<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc0"></A>Abstract</h1>

<p Align=justify>This study is an attempt to track certain issues related to
the status of English among a cohort of Tunisian university students. It
explores the value of English as perceived by university science students in
five higher education institutions in Tunisia. The institutions visited were
the Faculty of Medicine, the Engineering Preparatory Institute Tunis, the
Higher Institute of Commerce, the Higher Institute of Commerce and Business
Administration, and Faculty of science Tunis. A questionnaire was used to
collect data from a sample of 100 students, who were asked to express their
view about the value they attach to English and the use of it in their daily
lives. The data analysis revealed that a considerable percentage of Tunisian
university science students in the institutions visited claim to be proficient
in English and indicated that they were aware of the importance of English for
them as science and technology students in spite the fact that this awareness
is not accompanied by any detectable measures to develop their mastery of it.
Another finding of this research was that English was found to be slowly
occupying areas of use usually occupied by French despite the fact that French
was still their dominant language in research activity and entertainment. This
study provides evidence that the importance of English is very much recognised
by Tunisian university science students, which made the prospect of adopting it
as the language of instruction in scientific disciplines favoured. Obviously,
the situation of English in the Tunisian EFL context is gaining importance,
which suggests that it is going to be an influencing factor in the future of
Tunisia.</p>

<p Align=justify>I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the following
people without whom this work would not have been completed. First, I would
like to thank my supervisor Dr. Faiza Derbel for her endless support. Second, I
am grateful to my parents for their financial and moral support. Last but not
least, many thanks go to my friends Besma Msekni, Walid Jawadi, and Badr

<p Align=center><strong>0. Introduction</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The purpose of this introduction is to provide background
related to the value of English in the world and in the particular case of
Tunisian university science students. For this reason, the situation of
language in Tunisia will be described in order to offer an overview of the
context of the study and especially the linguistic situation. This introduction
is going also to explain the aims of the research and provide information about
data collection, and the way the paper is organised.</p>
<p Align=left><strong>0.1. Background to the study</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Since English is no doubt the most important language in the
world today (Crystal, 2003; Graddol, 1997; Phillipson, 1992), then it is of
interest to researchers to explore how it is valued by users all over the
world. Research on English and how it is perceived can be tackled from many
angles. This research will focus on the issues related to how English is valued
by young university science students in Tunisia. Reasons behind choosing this
topic are mainly linked to the functions that English fulfils in Tunisian
society and the complexity that it adds to the linguistic situation in Tunisia
in addition to its importance for science students. Whether the decision to
teach English as a compulsory subject in higher institutions is viewed as
positive or negative, depends on the fact that the society as a whole and
persons involved or affected by its presence will see the phenomenon from a
perspective of language competition or not. Those persons are going to perceive
it also with reference to various interpretative frames such as perceptions of
agendas underlying the policies or the felt needs for it. Within this context,
the issues related to the value of English in the world and in Tunisia
specifically are to be discussed in order to witness the benefits that teaching
English offers and the claimed drawbacks of such a decision.</p>
<p Align=justify>In fact, English is generally considered by policy makers in
Tunisia advantageous for fulfilling an important role in creating and
sustaining links with the world in terms of knowledge and transfer of
technology (Salhi, 1985; Derbel, 2001). Therefore, it will be of interest to
explore the views of the Tunisian population investigated in this research and
to find out how they see the importance of English. In contrast, English can be
seen as a new vehicle of colonialism (Phillipson, 1992) or as a threat to
native languages; this may well be a view held by some science students
investigated in this paper. The aim of such investigation is to track the value
attached to English and the extent to which it is perceived crucial in Tunisian
science students' studies and future careers. It is anticipated that Tunisian
university science students are aware of the value of English despite the fact
that they are not taking the &#171;right&#187; measure or following the
effective strategies to master it. Concerning the use of English by Tunisian
university science students, there is observable evidence of heavy domination
of French over English and to some extent over Arabic in the use of electronic
devices and in communication with foreigners. However, English is more present
in the lives of Tunisians due to technology and media in English that is more
and more available. These expectations are, in fact, connected to the
linguistic situation in Tunisia and this research is seeking to empirically
investigate such impressions and observations in the case of Tunisian
university science students.</p>
<p Align=left><strong>0.2. Language in Tunisia:</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The linguistic situation in Tunisia is characterised mainly by
diversity (Payne, 1983). Standard Arabic is the official language of the
country while a variety of regional dialects is used following the difference
in the geographical areas (ibid). Concerning foreign languages present in the
Tunisia, Payne (1983) documented the existence of French, Italian, and Spanish,
which dates back to the colonial period.</p>
<p Align=justify>However, English was introduced after independence and it went
through various stages of development that are going to be described more
thoroughly in the fourth section of the first chapter. The presence of English
resulted in competition with French as the most dominant foreign language in
Tunisia since the period of colonisation. The possibility of replacing French
for English is according to some researchers (Battenburg, 1997) considerable
viewing to the growing international interdependence of the world on English
and the continuous vanishing of French as a language of world communication and
trade with some doubt in Walters (1999) who identifies only a 2% or 5% as
proficient users of English. Battenburg contends that the figures illustrating
the amount of money spent to sustain the use of language by France, the UK, and
the USA reveal that Tunisia is still considered a francophone country
(Battenburg, 1997). He mentioned that in 1996 while the USA and Britain spent
600.000 and 400.000 dollars respectively on promoting the study of English in
Tunisia, France spent 20 million dollars (Battenburg, English language teaching
in Tunisia). The struggle over dominance between English and French in Tunisia
is a matter of fact. In fact, some opposition figures in the parliament asked
for the adoption of English instead of French since in Akkari's terms &#171;the
French themselves have begun to realise the inadequacy of their language and
its loss of international prominence&#187; (qtd in Daoud, 2001).</p>
<p Align=justify>Apart from education, English is used in media. Not all kinds
of media use English, but Walters (1999) mentioned that it is used an hour per
day on the <em>Radio Tunis Cha&icirc;ne Internationale</em> from 14.00 am to
15.00 am. Radio listeners can also listen to Voice of America and BBC World on
local FM frequencies (ibid). The only newspaper that uses exclusively English,
as observation shows, is Tunisia News. Observation shows also that the state
owned TV channel (<em>Channel 7</em>) broadcasts in English only at 00.00 am
when giving news and so is the case of <em>Tunis 21 </em>with</p>
<p Align=justify>difference in time. English speaking songs are heard also by
Tunisians on local radios (Walters, 1999) and more and more in all radio
channels. Thanks to satellite dishes, Tunisians have access also to channels
broadcasting in English like MB, MBC Action and MBC4 (with subtitles in
Arabic), the world edition of CNN, and BBC World. All of the above-mentioned
domains of exposure to English, though restricted can be assumed to have
important influences on students' perception of the value of English in their
lives generally and in their careers in the near future.</p>
<p Align=left><strong>0.3. General aims</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>This paper aims primarily at exploring the value of English,
as it is perceived by university students in scientific fields and
investigating the use of English among them in the direction of recognising its
status.</p>
<p Align=left><strong>0.4. Research questions</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Considering the research aims mentioned above, a number of
research questions could be formulated especially with regards to the value
students attach to English in the direction of recognising their needs for
English and the arguments that they give in support of learning English. Thus,
two research questions are proposed as research focus in this paper.</p>

<blockquote>
<p Align=left>1.  What is the perception of Tunisian university science
students concerning the importance of English in their studies and future
careers?</p>
<p Align=left>2.  What are the domains of use that English occupies in the
lives of Tunisian university science students?</p>
</blockquote>

<p Align=left><strong>0.5. Data collection</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>In order to investigate the perceived value of English among
Tunisian university science students, a questionnaire covered (apart from the
five background information questions) five sections. The questions were of two
types. Closed-ended questions</p>
<p Align=justify>aimed at enabling students to choose from proposed
alternatives that concerned their level, perception, and use of English and
open-ended questions aimed at extracting direct information concerning the
reasons of their choices. The questionnaire was completed by one hundred
university science students from five higher education institutions in Tunis
and Manouba. The institutions investigated are stated in the following

<p Align=justify>The diversity of the institutions included serves the purpose
of collecting data from students specialising in different domains where
English is claimed to be of great value in the academic and future professional
life of these students. Therefore, it was expected that these students hold
views about the value of English in their present situation and in the near and
distant future.</p>
<p Align=left><strong>0.6. Organisation of the paper</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>This paper contains five chapters. The first chapter deals
with views related to the status of English in the world today. Chapter two is
reserved for the explanations of the methodology used in this paper. It will
clarify the `research design', `the participants', `the data collection
instrument', `data collections', and `data handling'. Chapter three presents
analysis of the data derived from the students' responses. The</p>
<p Align=justify>discussion of the findings is to be found in chapter four that
is divided into three sections. The first section overviews the results of the
exploration of science students' proficiency in English. The second section
will summarise the results related to Tunisian university students' perception
about the value of English. The final section of this chapter will cover
results from students reporting on their use of English. The paper will be
concluded by synthesising the major findings and discussing the contribution of
the study, its limitations, and by providing suggestions for other research.</p>
<p Align=justify>The starting point of this paper is going to be the
investigation of the situation of English in the world including its status in
Tunisia. It is important to track these issues in order to have a clear idea
about the perceived value of English that could be helpful in tracing possible
change putting into perspective the attitude of Tunisian university science
students towards English.</p>
<p Align=left><strong>Chapter one: English in the world</strong></p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc3"></A>1.0. Introduction</h2>

<p Align=justify>The aim of this chapter is to provide a review of the various
themes related to the value of English in the world and in Tunisia. It is
composed of four sections; the first tracks the aspects of the emergence of
English worldwide, the second deals with the explanations of this spread, the
third tackles the perspectives to such emergence, and the fourth covers the
status of English in Tunisia throughout modern history (from independence until
2007).</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc4"></A>1.1. Aspects of English spread worldwide</h2>

<p Align=justify>This section is going to provide a historical overview that
covers the major periods of the development of English to be the first language
of world communication based on accounts provided by authors such as Graddol
(1997) and Crystal (2003). Such a status is going to be the main concern of the
second sub-section that is entitled `the status of English around the world'.
The description of the emergence of English will follow the framework of the
sociolinguistics of World Englishes provided by Braj Kachru (1985) and
specifically his classification of English use around the world into three
concentric circles.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc5"></A>1.1.1. Landmarks in the history of English</h2>

<p Align=justify>The period between the 11<sup>th</sup> and the mid
15<sup>th</sup> century witnessed in its beginning the Norman Conquest to
England, which meant the period of confrontation between English and French. It
was also a period of language contact, which resulted in the borrowing of words
from French especially reinforced with making French the official language in
England (Graddol, 1997). Graddol (1997) suggests that during this period
educated people in England had to learn three languages, which are Latin,
French, and</p>
<p Align=justify>English. It could be remarked that during this period French
and Latin were still dominant over English.</p>
<p Align=justify>Between mid 15<sup>th</sup> and mid 18<sup>th</sup> century,
however, some revolutionary events concerning the emergence of English took
place. These events were marked by the use of English in trade, scientific
writings as a result of the industrialisation of Britain. The movement of
English beyond the borders of Britain; first to America as part of immigration
to North America and second India as a result of British imperial expansion was
also crucial in the emergence of English. Moreover, the increase in the
importance of printing and the beginning of teaching English in Holland and
France as a foreign language helped the process of English spread (ibid). It
could be said that at this point of time English started the process of
dissemination as a world language.</p>
<p Align=justify>Other important events in the path of English happened in the
period between mid 18<sup>th</sup> and mid 19<sup>th</sup> century. Graddol
(1997) in his book <em>The future of English?</em> stated among these events
standardisation of the language that was facilitated by the compilation and
publication of dictionaries and the achievements resulting from the industrial
revolution that transformed Britain into a technological and internationalised
nation leading to the advent of the use of English in advertising, media, in
telecommunication, and more and more in education. In addition to its use in
the fields mentioned above, it became the language of world organisations and
diplomacy (Crystal, 2003), which paved the way for another important phase in
the process of the emergence of English (Graddol, 1997). It will soon replace
French as the language of diplomacy and international communication (ibid). The
second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century brought more importance and spread
to English as major radio channels and television, entertainment activities,
and the internet adopted it (ibid).</p>
<p Align=justify>Researchers, such as Crystal (2003) and Graddol (1997),
provided the reasons for the spread of English in the 20<sup>th</sup> century
and linked it mainly to the impact of the</p>
<p Align=justify>British Empire and the rising political power of the United
States of America in the world after the Second World War. These issues are
going to be discussed in the second section of this chapter when dealing with
the explanations for the spread of English.</p>
<p Align=justify>Scrutinising the process of the development of English, it
could be said that the value of English has witnessed a gradual rise in terms
of importance in the world, which resulted in being the language of the
21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc6"></A>1.1.2. The status of English around the world</h2>

<p Align=justify>In fact, until the 16<sup>th</sup> century English was not so
much important in world communication (Crystal, 2003). Nowadays, English is
said to be the <em>lingua franca</em> of the world. Wehmeier (2000) defines it
as &#171;a shared language of communication used by people whose main languages
are different&#187; This definition is applicable to the situation of English
today such is the case of India and Kenya (Graddol, 1997).</p>
<p Align=justify>Certain facts about the existence of English in the world
could be helpful in understanding its status. Actually, Graddol (1997)
indicates that English is spoken by 750 million as English as a Foreign
Language (EFL) speakers, 375 million as Second Language (L2) speakers, and 375
million as First Language (L1) speakers. In addition to these speakers, major
influential world organizations such as the United Nations, where it is among
the six languages that are considered official, and the European Union are
adopting English (ibid).</p>
<p Align=justify>The existence and emergence of English in non-native English
countries is an important feature of its worldwide spread and reflects, in the
view of some (Crystal, 2003), the value attached to it and in the view of
others (Phillipson, 1992; Kachru, 1985; Pennycook, 1994), the sign of
imposition, domination and imperialism. In his <em>Encyclopaedia of English
language</em>, David Crystal (2003) mentioned some statistics</p>
<p Align=justify>about the use of English in six east African states showing
its deep infiltration into various domains. Table 2 below shows that English is
present in five East African countries (Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, Malawi, and
Zimbabwe) in high court, parliament, civil service, education, media, business,
signs, and has an official status in them. This means that it is present in the
legislative, judicial, and what is called the fourth branch of the political
system, which is media. Taking into consideration the variety of languages and
ethnic minorities that exist in these countries, one could deduce that English
has occupied domains of use otherwise impossible for the minority languages to
occupy. This situation usually leads to greater value attached to the learning
and mastery of English in these communities.</p>

<p Align=left>Studying the spread of English has been the concern of many
scholars who tried to investigate and describe this horizontal spread
(emergence of English all over</p>
<p Align=left>the globe). For instance, Braj Kachru (1985) presents the model
of the three concentric circles reviewed in the forthcoming sub-section.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc7"></A>1.1.3. Kachru's three concentric circles</h2>

<p Align=justify>In his investigation of the spread of English, Braj Kachru
(1985) presents a model that consists of three circles each one representing a
particular group of countries on the basis of the situation and the use of
English in them (see Figure 1 below).</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Figure 1: The three circles of English according to

<p Align=justify>The Inner Circle (at the centre), represents the countries
where English is the primary language and it includes the United Kingdom, the
United States of America, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. These countries
are said to represent what is called native speakers of English. He also refers
to them as &#171;norm- providing&#187; (Kachru, 1985) countries since the norms
of English use are derived from them. The</p>
<p Align=justify>second circle, which is called the Outer Circle, represents
countries where English is one of two or more official languages and used in a
variety of functions. Examples of such countries are mainly former colonies of
Britain such as India, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Africa, Nigeria, and Ghana.
Kachru calls such countries &#171;norm-developing&#187; (ibid) countries since
they are developing their own varieties. Some examples for such category are
Singaporean English and Indian English. The third circle, which is called the
Expanding Circle, includes countries where English is used as an international
language like, China, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and Zimbabwe. These countries,
according to Kachru, are &#171;norm-dependent&#187; (ibid) as they are not
developing their own varieties of English.</p>
<p Align=justify>If we follow Kachru's classification, Tunisia will fit into
this last category since English is used within the Tunisian context of English
as a foreign language. From personal observations, Tunisians and particularly
Tunisian university students, tend to view English as a necessary language to
master nowadays. However, some conditions that are going to be discussed
further in chapter five prevent most of them from learning it sufficiently.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc8"></A>1.2. Explanations of English spread worldwide</h2>

<p Align=justify>In order to investigate the variety of explanations suggested
to explain the worldwide emergence of English consulting references from
researchers like Crystal (2003), Phillipson (1992), and Graddol (1997) is
needed. Exploring their findings, this section investigates the historical,
political, economic, and practical reasons for the emergence of English around
the globe.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc9"></A>1.2.1. Historical reasons</h2>

<p Align=left>One of the explanations suggested with regard to the emergence of
English is the historical factor. In fact, researchers such as Crystal (2003)
reported that English</p>
<p Align=justify>benefited from being the language of Britain, which was a huge
empire during the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> century especially.
Consulting Phillipson (1992) in his provocative <em>Linguistic imperialism,
</em>one could realise the difference between his perspective and that of
Crystal (2003). Phillipson emphasised, for instance, the persistent role of
Britain in imposing English on its colonies. Therefore, it could be deduced
that this imposition is in his account an important factor behind the
influential presence of English in many countries today. There is no
coincidence in the fact that in former British colonies, like India and Egypt,
English occupies an important status in education, media, governmental
documents, and trade. Crystal (2003) proposes the same idea but presenting the
emergence of English as an ordinary and totally positive spread. As a
conclusion, it could be said that making English the language of instruction in
those countries is a colonial heritage. However, the historical reasons were
not to happen without political motives that are the concern of the forthcoming
sub-section.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc10"></A>1.2.2. Political reasons</h2>

<p Align=justify>It is important to deal with political reasons behind the
imposition of English because politics is an influencing player in the game of
whose language dominates in non-native contexts. The political reasons could be
classified as either internal or external.</p>
<p Align=justify>The internal reasons come from the countries where English is
adopted as a solution to the problems created by multilingualism (Crystal,
2003). In fact, certain countries choose to adopt English, as a solution to
their multilingual situation such is the case of India and Kenya.
Multilingualism could create difficulties with communication internationally
for any country, as it could create a heated debate over what language to adopt
as the official language. In some multilingual contexts as remarked by
Phillipson (1992) &#171;English has been described as an ethnically and</p>
<p Align=justify>ideologically unencumbered language&#187;. This means that it
can be perceived as a &#171;neutral&#187; and &#171;unifying&#187; language
since it allows ethnic minorities in such countries to avoid conflicts about
which group language to choose as the official language of the country.
Communication between the different ethnic groups becomes carried through
English instead of the, less practical perhaps, variety of languages. As far as
neutrality is concerned, it should be stated that this apparent neutrality is
misleading as it can be argued that English in the context of most of such
countries is the language of elites, which means that at the end a language of
a minority is dominating the majority of uneducated members of the language
community (Pennycook, 1994). The only difference is that this minority is
privileged and perhaps supported by `English powers' such is the case of the
elite governing in Philippines in the 1980s described in Phillipson, 1992.
Apart from the internal reasons there are some external ones suggested by
Phillipson (1992).</p>
<p Align=justify>The external reasons are those related to factors (or plots)
coming from outside the country which means the overt and covert pressure
exercised by the inner circle on some countries in order to impose English as
the language of the most important fields in the country and this is done
mainly for political and ideological purposes. Such a claim could be
illustrated with the attempts of the British government to alter the dominance
of the USSR over Eastern Europe in 1990s by imposing English as the second
language instead of Russian (Phillipson, 1992). However, other explanations for
this shift from Russian to English could be thought of especially in connection
to the fall of the USSR at that period and the loss of faith in the communist
ideology. This could mean that the spread of English in Eastern Europe came
from inside these countries not outside them.</p>
<p Align=justify>External organised strategic imposition, as it is claimed by
Phillipson (1992), is neither for the sake of the beauty of English nor for the
sake of `civilising' people in</p>
<p Align=justify>those countries. In fact, English could serve as a facilitator
of the emergence of free trade, which strengthens the imposition of
globalisation.</p>
<p Align=justify>As far the situation in Tunisia, the context of this study, it
should be noted that despite the diversity of the linguistic situation, it
could not be said that it is a multilingual country in the same sense as in
Kenya or India but there are the regional dialects constructing the Tunisian
linguistic variations of the same Arabic with the presence of French and
Italian in the background. Therefore, the internal political reason explaining
the penetration of English in some countries does not apply to the case of
Tunisia.</p>
<p Align=justify>In the case of Tunisia, the pressure of the inner circle is
not persistent as Tunisia is considered a francophone country for historical
reasons, especially due to the fact of having been colonised by France not an
English speaking country. This is an important fact that is going to be put
under study in the fourth chapter when analysing some aspects of the
relationship between English and French in Tunisia.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc11"></A>1.2.3. Economic reasons</h2>

<p Align=justify>Dominating and even participating in world economy needs
mastering the language of the economically dominant (Derbel, 2004). The main
language of the United States of America, which is dominating and monitoring
world economy, is English, which means that taking part in international
business depends on knowledge of English (Phillpson, 1992). For this reason, a
lot of money has been spent on learning this language. It seems from this
perspective that the dominance of the US after the Second World War resulted in
the dominance of English in the modern history. This saying could be
illustrated by Graddol's claim that &#171;the story of English in the
20<sup>th</sup> century has been closely linked to the rise of the US as a
superpower that has spread the English language alongside its economic,
technological and cultural influence&#187;</p>
<p Align=justify>(Graddol, 1997, p. 8). Within the context of a globalised
capitalist world economy, governments and individuals found no way but to
learn, teach, and use English in order to live and to prosper. Therefore, the
economic reasons are either internal or external.</p>
<p Align=justify>The internal ones are those related to the attempt of the
governments in the world to promote the mastery of English among its economy
agents for the sake of integration in world economy (Derbel, 2001). In the same
vein, Phillipson (1992) illustrates this claim when he argues that &#171;the
discourse accompanying and legitimating the export of English to the rest of
world has been so persuasive that English has been equated with progress and
prosperity&#187;.</p>
<p Align=justify>The external ones are those related to the British and later
on the American attempts to spread English in order to make English the
language of world economy for the sake of more and more economic, political,
and ideological dominance.</p>
<p Align=justify>At the level of economy, Tunisia is very much connected to
Europe and mainly France more than English speaking countries (Bahloul, 2001;
Derbel, 2001). Importation and exportation could determine which language to
promote which determines also the language to be favoured by students.</p>
<p Align=justify>However, apart from the internal and external economic
reasons, there exist some practical reasons, which strengthen the importance of
the value of English and legitimate the claim that the world is increasingly
depending on this language (Graddol, 1997).</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc12"></A>1.2.4. Practical reason</h2>

<p Align=justify>The practical reasons are in relation with what English offers
to its individual learners, which create the extrinsic motivation to learn it.
Gardner (1985) differentiated between &#171;extrinsic&#187; and
&#171;intrinsic&#187; motivation (qtd in Liu, 2007).</p>
<p Align=justify>In a study that concerned the Chinese context, Meihua Liu
mentioned that extrinsic (or instrumental) motivation refers to the fact of
learning a language for the sake of gaining a tangible reward. Therefore, it is
linked to some external forces like learning English in order to succeed in
education, avoiding a punishment, to pass the TOEFL, qualifying for a job,
achieving a higher social status, getting a rise in salary, or studying in an
English speaking country (Liu, 2007). This kind of motivation differs from
intrinsic motivation as a driving forces in learning. Intrinsic motivation
refers to the forces that urge the learner to learn a particular language and
that are coming from inside them (ibid). Instead of being related to material
gains, they are related to the desire of the learner to learn a second or
foreign language for the sake of being part of the speech community that speaks
that language or out of fascination towards its culture (ibid).</p>
<p Align=justify>The practical reasons, then, are related to the presence of
English everywhere and for this reason, it seems extremely important to master
it. In fact, with English comes the promise to those who will master it to
succeed in life, as it will allow them to gain access to knowledge in all
domains especially in fields connected to science and technology. Table 2 below
includes a list although not exhaustive of the fields where English is used.</p>
<p Align=left><strong>Table 3: Major international domains of English (Graddol,

</TABLE></DIV>

<p Align=justify>The variety of domains listed in the table above illustrate
the fact that in order to read a scientific article, to use technological
products, to look for research information, to have access to studies about the
world's phenomena, mastery of English is needed. It is especially required to
communicate and participate in trade with Europe and America, but also
important even to enjoy popular music and films produced predominantly in
Hollywood in English. It is also crucial for young people to participate in
youth culture; to enjoy watching world television, to use computers and video
games, and a huge variety of other activities for which English is required. In
brief, English is a necessity for inclusion in any domain today.</p>
<p Align=justify>These facts concern any country in today's world including
even former colonies of France such is the case of Tunisia. Actually,
observation of the Tunisian context implies that the above-mentioned reasons
for the spread of English are the most applicable in Tunisia (Derbel, 2001).
The claim is so as an expected increasing awareness that is going to be
measured in the analysis of data collected from the questionnaire, exists among
Tunisians and especially students about the value of English in their lives
today's and in the near future.</p>
<p Align=justify>All the explanations mentioned within this section suggest the
various reasons elucidating the spread of English around the world. Such a
spread could not be understood as the exclusive result of one of the reasons
because all of them complemented each other to create the situation of this
language today. This situation generated conflicting perspectives to the
worldwide domination of English, which is going to be the concern of the third
section of this chapter.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc13"></A>1.3. Perspectives to the spread of English</h2>

<p Align=justify>The aim behind dealing with the perspectives to the spread of
English is to investigate what might be the causes of resisting the spread of
English and the reasons for supporting it. For this reason, these views of
`resistance to English spread' and those `supporters of English spread' will be
discussed in light of ideas about the position of English in the future as
forecasted by David Graddol (1997) in his book <em>The future of English?</em>,
which can help in our attempt to understand the perception of Tunisian
university science students later on in the discussion of the findings.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc14"></A>1.3.1. Resistance to English spread</h2>

<p Align=justify>Throughout history, some countries took decisions to block the
spread of English (Crystal, 2003). The former USSR and France are two examples
of countries where such efforts were deployed.</p>
<p Align=justify>In fact, the soviets saw English as a dangerous threat to
communism. The reason behind this position was that the spread of English meant
the spread of thoughts. What the soviets seemed to be afraid of, actually, is
the spread of capitalism under the cover of the spread of English (Crystal,
2003). As discussed by Ajroud (1994), certainly the USSR had no problem with
disseminating the Russian language and communism in Eastern Europe. At the same
time it denounces the emergence of English and capitalism. The soviets depicted
English as the language of world capitalism and world domination (Crystal,
2003).</p>
<p Align=justify>Another political argument comes this time from France, which
was threatened by the spread of English. Before the rise of English, French was
dominating world communication as the <em>lingua franca</em> but with the rise
of English, it has lost this position mainly in the 20<sup>th</sup> century
where &#171;the international importance of other European languages,
especially French, has declined&#187; (Graddol, 1997, p. 8). The</p>
<p Align=justify>French, and for a long time, took practical decisions to deal
with this situation. They established the <em>Haut Comit&eacute; pour la
D&eacute;fense et l'expansion de la Langue Fran&ccedil;aise</em> in 1966 and
strengthened their links with francophone countries (Phillipson, 1992).</p>
<p Align=justify>The worldwide dominance of English was also criticised by
scholars such as Skutnabb-Kangas (1994) and Wardaugh (1987) for being the cause
of the loss of local languages. It has long been argued that &#171;when one
language expands it restricts the dominance of another&#187; (Derbel, 2004, p.
226). Such a situation happens when the dominant language earns more
&#171;domains of use&#187; while the dominated one &#171;experiences domain
loss&#187; (ibid). However, other scholars, such is the case of BruttGriffler
(2002) continue to claim that there is no correlation between the spread of a
language and the loss of local languages because the emerging language serves
only as an additional one and therefore its effect is benign. This last claim
could be refuted by the question that Pennycook (1994) raises concerning the
resulting extermination of minor (in terms of use) languages.</p>
<p Align=justify>In parallel with the critical views of the spread of English,
we find views of those who claim that it is not a threatening language and that
in the contrary it opens many doors for knowledge, creativity, and economic
development. This position is going to be the concern of the second
sub-section.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc15"></A>1.3.2. Supporters of English spread</h2>

<p Align=justify>Proponents of English worldwide spread could be those actively
engaged in its use around the globe. The United States with its domination
presses heavily in favour of English especially in Asia (Phillipson, 1992;
Ajroud, 1994). The argument is that the introduction of English opens the door
for non-English speaking countries to receive American and British support and
aids. Even though there is no evidence of who these people are and/or what they
do exactly, it is said sometimes that history</p>
<p Align=justify>repeats itself, which means, according to Ajroud's (1994)
contention, that &#171;the bible and the sword have been replaced by the
language teacher and the IMF `aid'&#187; (p. 111). Habib Ajroud (1994) is
making by this statement an analogy between the ancient religious crusades and
the actual linguistic ones. Receiving English language professionals and books
has been a pre-condition for receiving British and American economic aids as
implied by Battenburg (1997) who criticised Tunisian officials for using
language policy as a means to extort money from the Americans. Therefore, it
could be said that Britain and the USA have been engaged in promoting English
in Tunisia.</p>
<p Align=justify>The British Council (BC) and TESOL international could also be
considered as agencies in support of English spread. The BC is a public
organisation that was founded in 1934 in order to spread the English language,
literature, and culture in the world for the sake of serving the interests of
Britain (Phillipson, 1992). Certainly, these goals are slightly different from
those recognized officially by the organization or said differently in order to
be easy to `swallow'. On its official website, the BC claims, however, that its
goals are related to establishing cooperation &#171;increasing exchange and
mutual understanding&#187; (The British Council Annual Report 2006-2007)
between the UK and other countries. In order to understand the deep and hidden
motives behind the creation of the British Council it could be resorted to what
the Prince of Wales said after its establishment in 1934. In fact, he said that
&#171;the glories of our literature, our contribution to the arts and sciences
and our pre-eminent contribution to political practice... (the appreciation of
these) can be best achieved by promoting the study of our language abroad&#187;
(qtd in Ajroud, 1994, p. 114). The repetition of the term `our' three times is
extremely meaningful as it shows whose interests the British Council is going
to serve. However, it could be said that this is normal since the matter
concerns British money that serves British interests.</p>
<p Align=justify>Support to English spread comes also from English as a Second
Language (ESL) and an increasing number of EFL countries, which are promoting
the use of English in various domains for the reasons mentioned in the previous
section of this paper (historical, political, economic, and practical reasons).
Therefore, in the context of all of this support for English, one might wonder
about the future of this language. Such a question is going to be dealt with in
the forthcoming sub-section.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc16"></A>1.3.3. Predictions about English in the future</h2>

<p Align=right>David Graddol (1997) tried in his book <em>The Future of
English? </em>to predict the</p>
<p Align=left>situation of English in the future. He wrote:</p>
<p Align=justify>There is no reason to believe that any other language will
appear within the next 50 years to replace English as the global lingua franca.
The position of English has arisen from a particular history which no other
language can in the changed world of the 21<sup>st</sup> century repeat. (p.
58)</p>
<p Align=justify>Perhaps what might assist the expected domination is that
English could become recognised as the world language and would no longer be
linked to colonialism. Therefore, the sustaining of its domination might not to
be because of what it refers to (i.e. colonialism) but what it gives (i.e.
prosperity). In fact, its increasing presence in EFL countries especially in
education could decide much of its future (ibid). The prospect of this presence
in a number of EFL countries like Tunisia is going to be measured when
analysing the questionnaire.</p>
<p Align=justify>Predicting the scenarios that might happen in Asia as far as
English is concerned, Graddol (1997) suggests three possibilities. The first is
that English will remain the language of communication between Asian countries.
The second is that Mandarin could become more important. The third possibility
is that there will be no dominant language, which means that people will use
many regional languages for</p>
<p Align=justify>communication. Viewing to the rising importance of the Asian
economies and the possibility of adopting English in all sectors for them, one
could wonder about the value that today's university science students assign to
mastering this language in Tunisia as an example of EFL countries. However,
this claim could be discussed by the fact that Tunisia is connected to
francophone countries more than Anglophone ones especially in terms of economy.
Yet, it is important to mention that globalisation does not separate between
countries based on this distinction. What is meant by this is that the rising
importance of English together with the rising importance of economic world
dependence on it leads to questioning the value young university students in
the economic, technological, and scientific sections attribute to English. Such
an issue is going to be discussed in chapter four. Whatever be the results,
they are certainly influenced by the measures that have been taken to promote
English throughout history and especially after independence. These measures
are going to be discussed in the fourth section of this chapter, which tracks
the situation of English in the educational system of Tunisia and the phases of
its implementation.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc17"></A>1.4. English in Tunisia</h2>

<p Align=justify>This issue is going to be dealt with in four sub-sections that
describe the various phases of the promotion of English from independence until
2007 in Tunisia based primarily on works of Tunisian researchers such as Salhi
(1984), Derbel (2001), and Daoud (2001). The importance of this issue lies in
the fact that these phases reflect the value attached to English by Tunisian
governments from independence until now (2008), which contributes in the
formation of Tunisian university science students' perception of English. While
the first sub-section, which is entitled `the introduction phase' (from
independence until the end of the 1970s) tracks the first measures taken to
introduce English in Tunisia, the second sub-section, which is entitled `the</p>
<p Align=justify>generalisation phase' ( from1970s until 1984), covers the
measures that were taken to support the learning of English. `The promotion
phase' ( from 1984 until 2000) where the study of English were more promoted is
going to be the concern of the third subsection before discussing `the present
phase' (from 2000 until 2007) in the implementation of English in the fourth
sub-section. Needless to mention that the periods could not be one hundred
percent exact as there could exist some reforms generalising the learning of
English during what was described as promotion or introduction phase and vice
versa.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc18"></A>1.4.1. The introduction phase: from independence until
the end of the 1970s</h2>

<p Align=justify>During this period, especially with generalising the teaching
of English in 1958 with the first educational reform, English was taught from
the second to the sixth year of secondary school for all sections, which were
scientific, literary, technical, commercial, teacher training, and economic
sections (Derbel, 2001). As described by Salhi (1984), this stage is
characterized by the absence of a clear efficient policy concerning teaching
English. The position of English was similar to that of other languages like
Italian, German, and Spanish. There was no Tunisian syllabus and no Tunisian
made textbooks for teaching English as textbooks were brought from France. In
fact even when teaching English at this stage one could easily infer the French
style revealed by the French-English vocabulary lists and translation from
French into English (Daoud, 2001). After the evacuation of Bizerte and the
nationalisation of agricultural lands, De Gaulle ended the French support for
teaching foreign languages in Tunisia, except for French. This decision opened
the doors in the 1970s for the United States of America and the United Kingdom
to participate in teaching English in</p>
<p Align=left>Tunisia through providing teachers and organisations working in
the field namely the Ford Foundation and Overseas Development Agency (Daoud,
2001; Derbel, 2001).</p>
<p Align=left>Concerning this stage, Salhi (1984) wrote:</p>
<p Align=justify>While little encouragement was shown by [Tunisian] educational
authorities towards English in the sixties, a major project developed mainly by
foreign organisations- American and British- was drawing to its close, namely
the consolidation of the <em>Institut Bourguiba des Langue Vivantes</em>
(I.B.L.V) as an institution for English language teaching. Although it was
marginal to the mainstream of education, the I.B.L.V was the first planned
action in favour of English in Tunisia. (p. 82)</p>
<p Align=justify>Clearly, the British and the Americans acted in favour of
introducing English in Tunisia. The British and the American assistance helped
the establishment of the I.B.L.V in 1964 that worked mainly on teaching English
to the public for acceptable prices and later on English for Specific Purposes
(ESP) in 1980s (Daoud, 2001). The introduction of English was followed by some
measures taken in order to promote learning it, which are to be reviewed in the
forthcoming second sub-section.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc19"></A>1.4.2. The generalisation phase: from 1970s until
1984</h2>

<p Align=justify>Daoud (2001) gathered some facts about this stage. He
mentioned that during this period, Tunisia started trying Tunisian textbooks
and teaching English became limited to scientific, literary and economic
sections. Moreover, in 1983, the Ariana Pilot School was established and it
taught pupils scientific disciplines in English instead of French from the
seventh year (Daoud, 2001). This was in basic and secondary education but in
higher education only students who chose to study English and students of
scientific sections got access to English thanks to the ESP project. In 1981,
the Transfer of Technology Program started with American assistance allowing
holders of baccalaureate to study in the United States of America in scientific
sections.</p>
<p Align=justify>Such an act reflected the government's concern at that time to
have access to science and technology directly from the source without the
mediation of French. Such an objective could be revealed from the goals of the
Sixth Development law (ibid).</p>
<p Align=justify>In spite of the increase in graduate and post graduate
students going to study in English speaking countries, and the number of
institutions providing students with ESP courses increased, Salhi (1984) argues
that there still &#171;[was] no clear English language policy in Tunisia and no
coordination at the level of the ministry of higher education&#187;. Therefore,
more efficient measures are to be taken to promote the study of English, which
are going to be reviewed in the next sub-section.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc20"></A>4.3. The Promotion phase: from 1984 until 2000</h2>

<p Align=justify>During this period, there was confusion in the implementation
of English because of the political situation just before and at the eve of
November 7, 1987 (Derbel, 2001). Two main measures were taken, which did not
serve English in Tunisia. The first one is the transformation of the Ariana
School from an institution that teaches scientific disciplines in English to a
French medium institution in 1989 (Daoud, 2001). The second is the cancellation
of the project of establishing a university that teaches scientific disciplines
in English at the eve of the change in the political leadership of 1987 (ibid).
However, this period could be seen as a successful one especially as far as the
promotion of English in the educational system is concerned. In fact,
5<sup>th</sup> year students started learning English from the academic year
1994/95 before the abolishing of this measure and its replacement by teaching
English to 8<sup>th</sup> year students and followed by the 9<sup>th</sup> year
in September 1997 (ibid). This period also was marked by the promotion of
teaching English in higher education and its introduction in the 7<sup>th</sup>
year of basic education in 2000 (ibid). It is true that these measures are
essential in the process of promoting the teaching of English. However,</p>
<p Align=justify>they came slightly late as they followed the retreat of
American and British agencies from supporting the dissemination of English in
North Africa. Such retreat was, according to Daoud (ibid), because of British
concern in ELT in Asia and because of the rise of the conservatives in America.
Therefore, after such retreat, the officials in Tunisia recognised that the
implementation of English is a necessity. Now they have to do that on their own
(ibid). However, this account from Daoud could be discussed by the fact that
the concern in English by Tunisian officials increased gradually following the
increase in the importance of this language and taking into consideration the
economic factor that tied Tunisia to France. Yet, Derbel (2001) argues that
concerning the implementation of English there existed macro level measures and
micro level ones that did not strengthen the position of English in education,
society, and business.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc21"></A>4.4. The present phase: from 2000 until 2007</h2>

<p Align=justify>This phase is characterised primarily by the lowering of the
age of learning English at primary schools in 2005 as it became taught from the
6<sup>th</sup> year (Merdassi, 2007). Such an act was certainly taken as a
result of a growing awareness about the importance of teaching English at an
early age in order to promote mastery of it. It seems that this measure is a
needed decision despite the existence of some limitations in it. Actually,
observation shows that teachers (of other disciplines) in primary schools are
hardly competent in teaching English for pupils, as they are not well trained
in the field of English Language Teaching in spite of government's effort to
train them through summer courses.</p>


<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc22"></A>Conclusion</h1>

<p Align=justify>One of the aspects of the spread of English worldwide is the
emergence of its use vertically (i.e. its infiltration into major domains of
life) and horizontally (i.e. its propagation around the world). The appearance
of the division of ESL and EFL</p>
<p Align=justify>countries is one of the aspects of the horizontal spread of
English. Putting into consideration the rising importance of English as a
global language, it seems crucial to investigate the value attached to it by
young university students in the sciences. The variation of the reasons
explaining the worldwide emergence of English strengthens this claim as within
some of those reasons one can realise the dependence of the coming decades on
English in the world (Graddol, 1997) despite the fact that according to some
perspectives English is the sign of colonialism (Phillipson, 1992). Such a
position is expected to be of minor importance in Tunisia and especially for
Tunisian university science students. The perception of the value of English
among those students can be coloured by the various attempts to promote it, at
least apparently, in education since independence.</p>

<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc23"></A>2.0. Introduction</h2>

<p Align=justify>This chapter aims at providing the context of the research in
terms of components and way of data collection and analysis. For this reason,
it is composed of five sections. The first sub-section deals with the research
design that is the reasons behind choosing the survey method. The second
sub-section contains the description of the participants before moving to deal
with the questionnaire itself in terms of its themes in the third sub-section
entitled `the data collection instrument'. The procedures, the timing, and the
difficulties witnessed when collecting information are to be dealt with in the
fourth sub-section under the subtitle `data collection'. Finally, the way the
data was handled will be the focus of the fifth sub-section entitled `data
handling'.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc24"></A>2.1. Research design</h2>

<p Align=justify>The aim of this paper is primarily to investigate the value of
English as perceived by Tunisian university science students. For this reason,
the questionnaire is helpful in gathering the needed information as it allows
to elicit personal view directly from the respondents.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc25"></A>2.2. The participants</h2>

<p Align=justify>The target population of this paper is one hundred Tunisian
university science students in five higher education institutions in Tunis and
Manouba. The institutions are the Faculty of Medicine, the Engineering
Preparatory Institute Tunis (IPEIT), the Higher Institute of Commerce (ESC),
the Higher Institute of Commerce and Business Administration (ISCAE), and the
Faculty of Science Tunis. The decision of choosing science students was taken
because of the important link between them, English, and the future. Their
perception could be valuable in recognising attitudes towards English</p>
<p Align=justify>today (2008) and according to who are assumed to be the
scientists of the future in Tunisia in the direction of predicting their
inclusion to a world dominated by English. <strong>2.3. The data collection
instrument</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The questionnaire was divided into six sections. The first one
contained the background information about the students, which means their age,
gender, department, level, and specialisation. The second section aimed at
collecting data about the proficiency of the students as they claimed it. For
instance, responded were asked to indicate their level in the last English exam
they sat for by giving them three alternatives (0-7, 8-12, and 13-up) in order
to classify them into &#171;under average&#187;, &#171;intermediate&#187;, and
&#171;Good&#187; learners of English. The second and the third questions of
this section aimed at exploring students' communicative ability. What is meant
by `communicative abilities' is their ability to perceive English utterances
and communicate using English. Therefore, the second question of this section
explored their ability to understand people speaking English in an authentic
English film or TV program by giving them four alternatives. The first
alternative &#171;I understand every word they say&#187; is taken to reflect
ability as very competent users of English. The second alternative provided in
&#171;I miss few words at times&#187; was put to classify respondents
intermediate in understanding spoken English. The alternative &#171;I have
difficulties with understanding&#187; was put to investigate the number of
students who assess their ability as &#171;weak&#187; or &#171;low&#187;. The
fourth alternative that is &#171;I understand better British films than
American films aimed at recognising the closest variety to students' abilities.
In the third question of this section, the concern was student' ability to
produce exclusively English utterances when in real life and the possible
alternatives they resort to when they cannot communicate their ideas. Thus,
students had to choose between three alternatives, which are
&#171;perfectly&#187;, &#171;sometimes I resort to</p>
<p Align=justify>gestures&#187;, and &#171;I resort to French if I can't
express myself&#187;. The first alternative concerns competent users of English
at the level of verbal production while the second and third alternatives aimed
at scrutinising the possible solutions students resort to when failing in
finding English words. In an attempt to witness the relationship between
English and French in terms of use, students were asked, in question four, to
identify the language of their favourite films and, in question five, of the
interface when using internet.</p>
<p Align=justify>In section three, the position of English in students' plans
was put under study. They were asked to identify whether they plan to study in
an English speaking country or just they need English to have access to more
sites on the internet for their studies. The emphasis of this question is
mainly the second alternative which is planning to study in an English speaking
country.</p>
<p Align=justify>Sections four and five questioned the attitudes of students
concerning English. The first question of section four aimed at recognising the
percentage of students who studied English out of public institutions and the
rate of those who did not in addition to the reasons behind each choice. The
reasons were reported using open-ended questions as an attempt to elicit direct
information from the participants. The second question of the fourth section
tackled the domains of the importance of English according to the students.
They were offered two intrinsic motivators (&#171;to discover other cultures of
the world&#187; and &#171;to find out about any topic of the world&#187;) and
two extrinsic motivators (&#171;to succeed in education&#187; and &#171;to
succeed in professional life&#187;) in order to witness the type of motivation
that drives the students. The third question dealt with the possible obstacles
students' face with learning English. They were asked to choose the most
inhibiting obstacle. Such a question aimed at recognising students'
difficulties concerning mastering English. The first alternative provided was
the &#171;absence of extra curricular activities&#187; and it aimed at
measuring the number of</p>
<p Align=justify>students who think they could promote their level from
activities like English clubs. The rational behind suggesting the alternative
of &#171;dominance of French language in Tunisia&#187; is investigating the
degree to which the availability of this language is an obstacle facing
learning English. The alternative of whether students feel they have no time to
study English or not was put to explore the degree to which students claimed
that loaded timetables is an obstacle. The alternative that the time allocated
to study English is not encouraging was put on the basis of personal
observations of complaints of science students who claim they could not learn
English because the time allocated for it is too early or too late. The last
alternative in this question is that &#171;the program is not interesting&#187;
and it is put because students might feel bored and frustrated because of
particular kinds of programs that, for example, enormously lay on the
structure.</p>
<p Align=justify>In the fifth section, the prospect of adopting English and
Arabic and the reasons behind the choices were tackled. In the first question,
which concerned the possibility of adopting English as the language of
instruction in universities teaching science and technology, students were
given four alternatives which are &#171;I agree&#187;, &#171;I disagree&#187;,
&#171;I totally disagree&#187; (which aim at measuring those who extremely
refuse the idea), and those who say they are &#171;indifferent&#187;. The
degree of acceptance or refusal is measured as students might have some
conditions before taking such a decision. In the same question, they were asked
to provide the reasons for their choices. They were not given alternatives as
the question was given in an open-ended manner to elicit direct and real data.
The same structure used with the first question of section five was used with
the second question in the same section. Students were asked to state their
perception of adopting Arabic as the language of instruction in scientific
sections at universities and to provide the reasons (in an open-ended manner)
for their choices. The solutions students propose as measures to promote the
learning of English among science students are investigated in the third
question of this section. Students had to choose</p>
<p Align=justify>what they think the most efficient decision from five
alternatives, which are &#171;oblige teachers to use tape recorders and
multimedia in teaching English&#187;, &#171;increase the coefficient of
English&#187;, &#171;establish English clubs in every university&#187;,
&#171;increase the hours devoted to study English&#187;, and &#171;teach
English literature and civilisation&#187;. Suggesting using multimedia and
establishing clubs as alternatives to the question intends to exploring the
rate of students who support creative methods in teaching as a solution to
promote learning English. Increasing the coefficient aims at investigating
instrumentally motivated students while increasing the number of the hours aims
at measuring whether students do need more exposure to English or not.</p>
<p Align=justify>The sixth section of the questionnaire, which investigated the
use of English among university science students, is composed of three
questions. The first question reports students' use of English when sending
e-mails where students were given three alternatives, which are
&#171;never&#187;, &#171;few times&#187;, and &#171;many times&#187;. The
second question scrutinised the situations where students were obliged to use
English and they were given four alternatives which are &#171;never&#187;,
&#171;when chatting&#187;, &#171;when using English documents&#187;, and
&#171;with foreigners&#187;. The use of English was measured also in terms of
the language set in students' mobile phones. They were given four alternatives,
which are &#171;French&#187;, &#171;English&#187;, &#171;Arabic&#187;, and
&#171;other&#187;.</p>
<p Align=justify>In brief, the themes included in the questionnaire aimed at
collecting data mainly about three issues, which are students' proficiency in,
perception of, and use of English in education and daily life.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc26"></A>2.4. Data collection</h2>

<p Align=justify>After preparing the final draft of the questionnaire, 100
copies were produced and distributed by three undergraduate students from the
English department including the researcher. In order to sure the participants
understand the questions, the data</p>
<p Align=justify>collectors paraphrased or translated the questions into
Tunisia Arabic sometimes. April 14<sup>th</sup> 2008, the ESC and the ISCAE
students were investigated. By April 15, 2008, students of the faculty of
Medicine Tunis and students of IPEIT and of the Faculty of Science Tunis were
covered too by the researcher and one of the above-mentioned colleagues.
Actually, the work went smoothly and there were no difficulties apart from
being obliged to enter some institutions secretly in order to investigate the
students, as the team had no official paper allowing them to enter such
institutions. When some officials in the visited institutions inhibited the
team from entering, students, who were very cooperative, were met in front of
their faculties.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc27"></A>2.5. Data handling</h2>

<p Align=justify>Because of lack of enough knowledge concerning statistics
packages, handling data was done manually by the researcher. Questionnaires
concerning each institution were separated and for each question, the answers
were counted and checked twice and thrice if the numbers exceeded or were less
than the total number of investigated students in each institution. The answers
collected from all students were transformed into five sets of tables each set
representing the data collected from each institution and each table contained
the answers to a particular question. Then, the five sets of tables were
gathered into one set of tables containing the answers collected from all the
institutions put together. The tables of the last set representing the total
answers collected from students were transformed into graphs using Microsoft
Excel. In the following chapter, the results will be discussed.</p>

<p Align=justify>The analysis of the questionnaire data indicates that
concerning the level of science students in English, which is retrieved from
their claimed marks, an important percentage of them could be classified as
`Good' since 44% of the investigated students said that they obtained more than
thirteen in their last exam. In fact, only 14% reported that they obtained less
than 7 out of twenty in their last exam as Figure 2 below indicates. Students
who obtained a mark between 8 and 12 represent 42% of the total students.</p>

students the most inhibiting obstacle towards learning English. &#171;Time
constraints&#187; and &#171;revising courses that are more important&#187; was
mentioned by 33% of the students investigated. &#171;Absence of extra
curricular activities&#187; and &#171;the program of teaching English is not
interesting&#187; were mentioned by 8% and 7% of the students respectively in
comparison to 12% who stated that the obstacle preventing them from learning
English is that &#171;the scheduled time of English is not
encouraging.&#187;</p>

<p Align=justify>As a response to the closed-ended question &#171;if you were
in charge of education in Tunisia, would you teach science and technology in
English?&#187;, 48% of the investigated participants claimed that they

fact, those who agreed with the idea of adopting English claimed that
&#171;English is important&#187; (50.9%). Students who totally disagreed with
the idea reported either that it is &#171;a problem of organisation as students
are used to French&#187; (27.2%) or provided no reason for such a choice
(0.9%). Mere disagreement concerns 16.3% who claimed that there is an
&#171;absence of command in English&#187;. It is notable that 4.5% of the
students claimed they are indifferent to such issue.</p>

<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc37"></A>3.4.2. Prospect of adopting Arabic</h2>

<p Align=justify>Responding to the closed-ended question &#171;if you were in
charge of education in Tunisia, would you teach science and technology in
Arabic?&#187; 86% of the students rejected the idea; among those, 64% selected
&#171;totally disagree&#187; and 22% selected</p>
<p Align=justify>&#171;disagree&#187;. Concerning this question, there were no
&#171;indifferent&#187; students (0%) and those who selected &#171;agree&#187;
represented only 14% of the participants as it is illustrated in Figure 13

&#171;no reason&#187; and the same figure goes for who refuse it because it
&#171;is boring&#187;.</p>

chose the alternative of &#171;obliging teachers to use tape recorders and

they prefer &#171;teaching English literature and civilisation&#187; as an
efficient measure to promote the learning of English among students in the

<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc40"></A>Conclusion</h1>

<p Align=justify>To conclude, one can say that the analysis of the
questionnaire data covered in this chapter reflected students' views concerning
particular issues. These issues are mainly their proficiency in English, their
attitude towards the questions related to it, and their actual use of English
in daily life, in mobile phones, and when using the internet. The results
illustrated in this chapter are going to be discussed in the forthcoming
chapter.</p>
<p Align=left><strong>Chapter Four: Discussion of the findings 4.0.
Introduction</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The general aim of this paper is to study the perceived value
of English among Tunisian university students in the scientific fields. In
order to realise this goal, two research questions have been asked:</p>

<blockquote>
<p Align=left>1.  What is the perception of Tunisian university students
concerning the importance of English in their studies and future careers?</p>
<p Align=left>2.  What are the domains of use that English occupies in the
lives of Tunisian university science students?</p>
</blockquote>

<p Align=justify>The aim of this chapter is to discuss the findings gathered in
the previous chapter concerning the data collected from the students. Three
sections constitute the components of this chapter. The first section is
entitled `Tunisian university science students' claimed proficiency in English'
and it is composed of three sub-sections. While the first sub-section concerns
`exams results' and the second concerns `reported communicative abilities', the
third sub-section tracks `English vs. French in science students' daily use'.
The perception of students concerning the value of English is going to be
discussed in the second section that contains four sub-sections. Such a
discussion is going to go through `English in students plans', `the reasons for
English', `science and the question of language choice', and obstacles of
learning English and some suggested solutions'. This last sub-section is going
to be divided into `obstacles of learning English' and some proposed
solutions'. Finally, in the last section of this chapter the concern is going
to be `the use of English among Tunisian university science students'. Thus,
the starting point of this chapter is `Tunisian university science students'
proficiency in English'.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc41"></A>4.1. Tunisian university science students' claimed
proficiency in English</h2>

<p Align=justify>As it was previously stated in the introduction to this
chapter, the concern of this section is going to be `exams results', `reported
communicative abilities, and English vs. French in science students' daily
use'.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc42"></A>4.1.1. Exams results</h2>

<p Align=justify>The analysis of the self-reported results indicates that 44%
of the investigated students obtained more than 13 in their last English exam,
which reveals &#171;Good&#187; proficiency. This fact could legitimate drawing
the conclusion that those students are competent in English especially that 42%
of them claimed that they obtained a mark between 8 and 12. Thus, it could be
said that more than half the students investigated might have obtained the
passing ten in their last exam in English. Therefore, the level of Tunisian
science students in English is promising and this could, actually, be
understood as an important number of them in the investigated institutions are
said to be brilliant learners who used to work hard in all subjects in their
secondary schools.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc43"></A>4.1.2. Reported communicative abilities</h2>

<p Align=justify>The ability of the students to understand English utterances
could be classified as &#171;acceptable&#187; since 57% of them claimed they
understand every word (5%) or they miss few words at times (52%). This, in
fact, could be understood especially putting into consideration their claims
concerning their marks. Students' reported communicative abilities were
investigated also with reference to another variable, which is their ability to
communicate only in English. The figures concerning this question illustrate
that only 10% of them could use English without being obliged to resort to
French or gestures. This figure does not seem striking, as complete competence
in English is hardly expected from students of science in an EFL country</p>
<p Align=justify>like Tunisia. Actually, 51% of the students resort to French
that offer them an alternative solution when they fail in finding the
appropriate English words. This could be explained by the daily access to
French in the lives of those students as they are educated through it more than
they are educated through English.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc44"></A>4.1.3. English vs. French in science students' daily
use</h2>

<p Align=justify>Concerning favourite films, 75% of the students prefer to
watch the French version in comparison to only 25% preferring the English one,
which reveals French domination and emphasise the idea of francophone Tunisia.
However, the importance of the 25% should not be ignored especially if some
historical facts that are linked to the near (real) introduction of English vs.
the older domination of French are put into consideration. Such a figure could
reflect the (relatively) fast and important spread of English in Tunisian
students' entertainment activities. Pertinent dominance of French is derived
from its authority over the educational of science students in Tunisia. For
instance, if students are to look for information concerning their courses
(that are taught in French), the majority of them (83%) are going to use French
in their search not English (17%). An important fact that needs to be
recognised also concerning the high rate of using French is that proficiency in
this language is higher by definition as it is the language of instruction and
the second language of the country. Putting in consideration these fact, one
could wonder about the perception of the value of English among those
students.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc45"></A>4.2. Tunisian university science students' perception
of the value of</h2>

<p Align=left><strong>English</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Four sub-sections are going to be the components of this
section, which are English in students' plans , the question of why English,
science and the question of language, and obstacles of learning English and
some suggested solutions.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc46"></A>4.2.1. English in students plans</h2>

<p Align=justify>The analysis of the results concerning the presence of English
in students career plans show that students valued having more access to
internet sites for their studies (59%) more than studying in an English
speaking country (41%). This reflects awareness about the importance of the
World Wide Web (that is mainly speaking English) in education. The important
percentage of students preferring to study in an English speaking country
reveals that Tunisian science students recognise the value of English as the
new lingua franca of the world.</p>
<p Align=justify>However, mere awareness of the importance of English is to be
accompanied with a real work on mastering it, which is not, unfortunately, the
case with Tunisian university science students. The analysis of the second
question, which concerns the presence of English in students' plans in the
past, shows that 74% have not attempted to improve their language skills
outside the classroom. Thus, real awareness about the importance of English
translated into real actions to invest in learning it. This leads to thinking
about the possible reasons behind this situation. In fact, 32 reasons out of
102 reflected that students were `not motivated' to do so, which means that
they had no encouragement from their educators nor from their parents. This
means that the responsibility of not being highly competent in English is
shared between the students, parents, and the educational system. Those who
claimed that there was `no need to' study English (mentioned 21 times) thought
that their level in English is sufficient. The relatively high prices provided
by the institutions teaching English, and mainly private ones and the British
Council, was a reason mentioned 22 times in science students' responses. Time
limitation was mentioned 27 times out of 102 and it could be understood only
with reference to the claimed loaded timetables that students complain</p>
<p Align=left>of. It seems that students found excuses reflecting lack of
motivation and the little attention language development in English has
captured in their lives as students.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc47"></A>4.2.2. The reasons for English</h2>

<p Align=justify>Generally, students with extrinsic motivators to study English
were proven in the analysis of the questionnaire to be in 57% of the cases
studied extrinsic. It is not a huge majority compared to the rate of students
who claimed that their goals are intrinsic (43%). What is striking in the
detailed analysis of the results is that only 7% of the students claimed that
their motivator is &#171;success in education&#187;. Compared to the rate of
students who value the importance of English in finding a job (50%), this rate
reveals that they do not see a connection between their education in English
and their professional need in English. The 7% reflects also that 93% of the
investigated students do not think that they need English to succeed.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc48"></A>4.2.3. Science and the question of language choice</h2>

<p Align=justify>An important majority of the investigated students (48%)
claimed that if they were in charge of education in Tunisia, they would teach
science and technology in English. This could reveal their awareness of the
importance of English in educating future generations. As it is shown from the
reasons they provided, 50.9% of the arguments emphasised the importance of
English in the world and especially for science students. In fact, an important
45% oppose the idea. It should be mentioned that this rate encompasses those
who &#171;disagree&#187; and those who &#171;totally disagree&#187;. Actually
who &#171;disagree&#187; mentioned the &#171;problem of organisation&#187; (27%
of the total arguments) concerning the issue, which means, if we take it
positively, that in case of existence of an organised plan to shift from
adopting French to adopting English, they might agree. Thus, the popularity of
such shift is considerable especially if the &#171;indifferent&#187; students
(7%) who claimed that any language fits science and technology</p>
<p Align=left>(4.5% of the total arguments) are put into consideration. Those
accepting the adoption of English could reach 55% of the total students.</p>
<p Align=justify>Obviously, the competition in terms of language preference
involves only English and French and not Arabic. 48.6% of the arguments
provided evolved around the idea that `Arabic is not a language of science' and
another 21.7% that &#171;Arabic is of no help&#187; on the international scene.
In other words, these students would not be upset if Arabic were to be
eliminated from the choice list. While it is not proven linguistically and
historically that a particular language could not be used in science, to say
that a particular language is not a language of science could reflect only
Tunisian university science students' bewilderment about the idea of adopting
Arabic. However, the claim that Arabic is not to be adopted as the language of
science because it does not assure communication with the outside world is
understood at least nowadays and in a world context characterised by dominance
of English over science and technology. 21.7% of the respondents mentioned that
Arabic would be an obstacle to communication with the outside world. Actually,
it should be stated that if French assures little communication (in comparison
to English) with the world in terms of research, collaborating in scientific
meetings, and working abroad, Arabic seems to assure nothing for the students
in this study.</p>
<p Align=justify>Thus, it becomes clear that while English receives
considerable support concerning the prospect of adopting it as the language of
teaching science and technology from the respondents, Arabic does not.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc49"></A>4.2.4. Obstacles of learning English and some suggested
solutions</h2>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc50"></A>4.2.4.1. Obstacles of learning English</h2>

<p Align=left>Various obstacles were mentioned in the responses that students
felt prevent them from learning English. From the data collected, it could be
inferred that the</p>
<p Align=justify>&#171;availability of French&#187; (40%) is the primary
obstacle facing students' learning of English. Therefore, because French is the
second language in Tunisia, Tunisian university science students face some
problems in learning English. However, the obstacles are mostly of
administrative order as 60% of them relate to the administration and the system
of education in the visited institutions. This is interesting as it could
reflect that those administrations are not considering students competence in
English among the needed priorities that necessitate special care and
management.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc51"></A>4.2.4.2. Some proposed solutions</h2>

<p Align=justify>The most proposed solution among the five suggested in the
questionnaire is &#171;increasing the coefficient of English&#187; (31%). This
reflects awareness on their parts that students are instrumentally motivated.
Therefore increasing the coefficient of English would be a relevant and
practical solution if the policy makers were really interested in raising the
level of science students' competence in English.</p>
<p Align=justify>Needless to mention also students' claimed need to be more
exposed to English in order to promote learning it. This fact could be deduced
from their argument that &#171;establishing English clubs&#187; (21%) and
&#171;increasing the time allocated to English&#187; (18%) is the best solution
to promote learning it. Therefore, the suggestions of students evolve around
the idea of improving proficiency level, through increasing the coefficient of
English, and changing the pedagogy of teaching it, through adopting new ways of
teaching. Students also emphasise the idea of implementing new and more
creative ways of teaching English (44%), which could be inferred from their
choice of the two alternatives &#171;obliging teachers to use tape recorders
and multimedia in teaching English&#187; (23%) and &#171;establishing English
clubs in every university&#187; (21%). It seems that there is a feeling of
discontent among the students from the pedagogy used</p>
<p Align=justify>to teach English to them as they are suggesting innovative
pedagogy of teaching that consists of extra curricular activities and using
technological devices instead of the traditional methods based on transactional
routines.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc52"></A>4.3. The use of English among Tunisian university
students</h2>

<p Align=justify>In general, it could be said that 89% of the students were
obliged in some situations to use English while the number of those who claimed
they have &#171;never&#187; been in such situations is 11%. Such a figure
reflects students' real need for English that is not met by the institutions as
revealed in the proposed solutions.</p>
<p Align=justify>Data collected from the section dealing with the use of
English indicates also that French dominates students' use of language in their
mobile phones (81%) but indicating at the same time that English is the second
choice (15%) before any &#171;other&#187; language (4%). Clearly, as far as
French is concerned, this is proof that it has over the decades secured a
prominent position in the daily lives of Tunisians especially among the
educated. The fact that students were not using Arabic is striking. This could
be interpreted as reflecting an attitude that Arabic is not the language of
technology (such is the case of mobile phones in this question.)</p>
<p Align=justify>Nearly half of the students (47%) claimed that they have sent
e-mails written in English, which is an interesting rate especially when
putting into consideration the availability of French and the difficulties they
reported they faced when expressing themselves in English. Concerning this
issue, English seems to be rivalling French even though we can doubt the level
of English used.</p>


<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc53"></A>Conclusion</h1>

<p Align=justify>Answering the research questions, it could be said that
Tunisian university science students are aware of the importance of English,
which made them suggest innovative measures to be taken to promote the learning
of it. Concerning the use of</p>
<p Align=justify>English, it was proven interesting viewing to the absence of
encouragement from parent and educators. Therefore, much of students'
exposition to English comes from informal contexts such as technology and
contact with foreigners.</p>

suggestions for other research, and some recommendations.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc54"></A>5.1. Major findings</h2>

<p Align=justify>The purpose of this study is to investigate the value of
English, as it perceived by Tunisian university science students. In order to
do so, two research question were asked:</p>

<blockquote>
<p Align=left>1.  What is the perception of Tunisian university science
students of English?</p>
<p Align=left>2.  What are the domains of English use according to them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p Align=justify>As far as students' perception of English, it was found
paradoxically that they are aware of its value, especially in professional
life, but they made no moves towards mastering it. This fact could be explained
by the availability of French and the lack of efficient administrative measures
to promote learning English. This situation resulted in the fact that students
do not value English much in the education sphere even though they are aware of
its position in the world in science and technology.</p>
<p Align=justify>Additionally, what is informative is that students felt the
need to adopt some new and creative methods in teaching English with more
exposure through English clubs and increasing teaching hours. A surprising
finding is that students lack the interest in learning English, as they feel
not motivated to do so mainly because of French availability but also because
they would like to be taught differently in a different &#171;informal&#187;
learning environment. However, concerning the prospect of adopting English in
teaching science, they proved to be accepting the idea to the detriment of
French and Arabic, which is interesting as a finding.</p>
<p Align=justify>As to the use of English among Tunisian university science
students, this language was found to be creeping in spite of the persistent
dominance of French, which could be explained by the increasing dependence of
certain entertainment activities and academic ones on English. It is clear they
have begun to make the switch in their use of electronic and technological
devices.</p>
<p Align=left><strong>5.2. Contribution of the study</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>All of the stated findings could contribute to the enrichment
of knowledge about the issue of the perceived value of English especially as it
suggests some recent statistics about the particular situation of Tunisian
university science students. One of the most interesting findings of this
research is that despite French domination over students' leisure activities
and education, English is gaining importance in their use. The importance of
this work also lies in the investigation of the real obstacles that are
inhibiting science students from mastering English, which are mainly French
availability, discontent with the teaching pedagogy, and lack of investment (in
terms of time and money). Moreover, suggesting feasible and especially
acceptable measures, from the part of students, to promote learning English is
another interesting finding of this paper. Concerning this matter, it was found
that more exposure to English whether formally (more allocated time for
teaching English) or informally (English clubs) is one of the most efficient
measure to enable students to increase their level in English. <strong>5.3.
Limitations of the study</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>This work encompasses certain limitations mainly because of
resorting only to 100 participants. In fact, the small number of the target
population does not allow drawing real generalisations about all Tunisian
science students.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc55"></A>5.4. Suggestions for further research</h2>

<p Align=justify>A study that concentrates on gender, level, and institutional
differences concerning the perceived value of English among university science
students could be helpful in clarifying important aspects of this issue. For
doing so, it seems important to resort to a test when measuring students'
proficiency and to supplement with interviews of university teachers.</p>


<h2 class="core"><A NAME="toc56"></A>5.5. Recommendations</h2>

<p Align=justify>It seems important that policy makers in the institutions
teaching science and commerce to decide to promote learning English and resort
to efficient measures derived from their students and ESP teachers such as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p Align=left>1.  Giving more importance to English by increasing its
coefficient.</p>
<p Align=left>2.  Providing teachers with appropriate materials for teaching
like English laboratories.</p>
<p Align=left>3.  Establishing English clubs and encouraging teachers to run
them.</p>
<p Align=left>4.  Establishing (at least) a university that teaches scientific
disciplines in English.</p>
</blockquote>

<p Align=justify>What seems needed from the part of learners is mainly good
will to master English and having access to scientific publications written in
English because of its importance for their future careers.</p>
<p Align=justify>Adopting more active, creative and motivating methods in
teaching science students instead of the traditional and sometimes monotonous
ways could be an important measure to take on the part of teachers. Examples of
such methods are:</p>

<blockquote>
<p Align=left>1.  Encouraging interpersonal interaction between the students
when doing classroom activities.</p>
<p Align=left>2.  Changing the environment of teaching by organising purposeful
excursions.</p>
<p Align=left>3.  Adopting communication based tests instead of paper-and
-pencil ones.</p>
