<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc3"></A>Introduction</h1>

<p Align=left>One of the most complex processes in a company<sup>,</sup>s first
steps toward globalization is the establishment of the overseas marketing base
in a local economy. Because the environment is naturally quite different from
market to market, a new strategy is required to face the challenges each new
situation presents to future success. Taking into consideration the rapidly
change and fluid business environment that exists in world markets today, the
most efficient and economical way to establish a presence is by merger.
Cross-border mergers have been used by a variety of companies as an effective
strategy for creating value. However its conduct has been accepted with
potential difficulties that may generate disputes.</p>
<p Align=left>The integration of firms through a merger requires joining
different corporate cultures, management and communication styles, experiences,
rules and procedures. This interconnection of cultures could lead to conflict
between shareholders and directors. Unresolved conflict during a merger could
lead to litigation, and collapse of the merger. In such a situation, businesses
and their transactional lawyers<sup>1</sup> should look to options that
cultivate and implement<sup>2</sup> well-organized and friendly dispute
resolution mechanisms to resolve these complex business transactions.</p>
<p Align=left>In order to cope with the increasing complexity of the modern
business world, alternatives to litigation<sup>3</sup>, has been developed, as
a natural and flexible means for resolving disputes that are likely to arise
between businesses. The issue is both current and relevant.</p>
<p Align=left>In order to prevent potential disputes that might arise during
the merger closing negotiations stages between domestic and foreign</p>
<p Align=justify><sup>1</sup> "<em>...A transactional lawyer is a lawyer who
works primarily on transactions such as...mergers, acquisitions and the
like...&#187;</em> Garner, B. A., "Black<sup>,</sup>s Law Dictionary", seventh
edition, ST PAUL, MINN, 1999 and from Westlaw Data Base, The Black<sup>,</sup>s
Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004)</p>

necessary to perform a task. Implementation means completion, execution,

<p Align=left class=notes><sup>3</sup>Litigation can be defined to include all adjudication
in a government forum, whether that forum is a court or some other government
body, such as administrative agency. Litigation is a process of dispute

<p Align=left>companies, the utilization of Alternatives to litigation would be
a significant and resourceful action.</p>
<p Align=left>First of all, it is necessary to set forth some basic
definitions, considered necessary tools for the analysis of complex
phenomena.</p>
<p Align=left>The Black<sup>,</sup>s Law Dictionary defines merger as "The
absorption of one organization (esp. a corporation) that ceases to exist into
another that retains its own name and identity and acquires the assets and
liabilities of the former... Corporate mergers must conform to statutory
formalities and be approved by a majority of the outstanding shares'.</p>
<p Align=left>Merger is a type of business combination that needs to be
distinguished from acquisition. Acquisition<sup>4</sup> is a generic term that
implies a transfer of ownership, while a merger constitutes a technical term
qualifying a particular legal process that would be followed or not by an
acquisition. It is more often the case of simple acquisition of companies
without being followed by mergers. During an acquisition the deal may be
negotiated or hostile. Instead in a merger the deal is negotiated. The
differences are to be detected in the legal treatments of these operations in
accordance with the national legislation in force"<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left class=notes><sup>4</sup> Acquisition (namely Takeover) can be defined as the
acquisition of ownership or control of a corporation. A takeover is typically
accomplished by a purchase of shares or assets, a tender offer or a<u>
merger.</u> Friendly takeover when is approved by the target corporation's
board of directors. Hostile takeover when is resisted by the target
corporation's board of directors. The black's law Dictionary note &amp; page

<p Align=left>Given that ,many elements between European legal systems like in
France and Germany which belong to the civil Law tradition<sup>6</sup> on the
one hand and the US legal system which belong to the Common law<sup>7</sup>
tradition ,on the other hand, will increase the divergence in carrying -out
cross-border mergers.</p>
<p Align=left>From European Company law perspectives, merger is considered as
"a corporate transaction that in volves the transfer of all of the acquired
company's assets and liabilities to the acquiring company, with the consequence
of the disappearance of the acquired company"<sup>8</sup>. In the same way,
from the Tunisian Company legislation in force<sup> 9</sup> merger is defined
as the "amalgamation of two or more companies to constitute one" and classified
in either a "fusion par absorption" where a company completely absorbs another
company (merger by amalgamation or by acquisition) and in a "fusion avec
creation d'une soci&eacute;t&eacute; nouvelle" where two companies merge to
form a new company (merger by consolidation or formation of new company)<sup>

participating companies are cooperating in different countries<sup>11</sup> and
are subject to different Company laws.</p>

involving companies at least two of which are governed by the laws of different
Member States". The Black's Law dictionary , Op.cit Page 1, note1</p>
<p Align=left>From US perspectives, Delaware<sup>12</sup> Company Law,
considered the main source regulating merger law, governs merger regime in
accordance with section 251 of the Delaware General Corporation Law as amended
on July 1, 1998<sup>13</sup> and classify it in both a "direct or legal merger"
and "triangular merger"<sup>14</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>The concept of merger takes place when "one constituent entity
merges with and into another "constituent" entity. The latter, "surviving,"
entity succeeds to all assets and liabilities of the disappearing entity by
operation of law<sup>15</sup>.</p>
<p Align=left>In European and Tunisian Company law, the acquired companies are
dissolved without going into liquidation<sup>16</sup>; the acquiring companies
increase their capital<sup>17</sup>. The deal is negotiated and requires the
draft of a merger contract that must be recommended by the board of directors
of each company and approved by the meeting of shareholders<sup>18</sup>.</p>

most prominent US corporations. This makes the general corporation law of
Delaware the most important corporation law in the United States. Prior to

<p Align=left>The world has witnessed the emergence of<sup> ,</sup>Alternative
Dispute Resolution<sup>,</sup> which refers to the wide range of Legal
possibility that use techniques other than trial to settle
disputes<sup>24</sup>. "Resolving a dispute might be defined as ending the
dispute in such a way that the claimant is satisfied with a just result or
through a fair process..."<sup>25</sup> Alternative dispute resolutions can be
considered as about all legally permitted, cheaper, more flexible and quicker
processes of dispute resolution other than litigation. They also meet some
needs of the business community that judicial litigation cannot offer:
confidentiality and an expertise on their settlement. Moreover, their tailoring
in business transactions demands a great deal of negotiation between drafters
in order to avoid the main problems that are likely to arise. Accordingly they
might symbolize what American scholars call "the modern technology of the
conflict- management system"<sup>26</sup>, in essence, techniques that could</p>
<p Align=left>compose it, with the capacity of continuous existence or
succession, &amp; having the capacity, as such legal entity of taking, holding

<p Align=justify>With the growing cross-border business activity, common law
and civil law scholars should take a fresh look at the intersection of dispute
resolution and international business.</p>
<p Align=left>Civil law countries are now developing an interest in
alternatives to litigation methods for the resolution of international business
disputes. Growing interest has been shown in ADR in the European Union.
Considered as a means of improving general access to justice in everyday life,
ADR has received close attention from the EU member states. This specific
European context explains the background for the preparation by the European
Commission of the "Green Paper on ADR" launched April 2002, to initiate a
constructive debate on a number of legal issues that had been raised with
regard to ADR in civil and commercial law. the European Commission has
published on April 2004, a "Preliminary Draft Proposal for a Directive on
Certain Aspects of Mediation in civil and Commercial Matters", as well as a
Draft European Code of Conduct for Mediators, which became final at a European
Commission Justice Directorate conference in Brussels on July 2, 2004.</p>
<p Align=left>Equally, extensive experience has been shown in alternative
dispute resolution in the US<sup>47</sup>. Many efforts have been made to
improve and unify regulation deal with Arbitration and mediation<sup>48</sup>.
In 1998, Congress adopted the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act (ADR Act),
which requires federal district courts to establish at least one ADR program
and to develop procedural rules for its wide and active use.</p>
<p Align=left class=notes><sup>46</sup> In 2002, the privatization of "l'Union
Internationale des Banques" (UIB) was lunched. In 5 November 2002,

role in the creation of standards of ethics and professional responsibility for

<p Align=left class=notes><sup>48</sup> In 1998, Congress adopted the Alternative Dispute
Resolution Act, which requires federal district courts to establish at least
one ADR program and to develop procedural rules for its wide and active use.</p>
<p Align=left>The subject of international Arbitration was also addressed in
the "Revised Uniform Arbitration Act" (ReUAA). Thus, many US states have based
their statutes on the Model Arbitration Law proposed in 1985 by the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).</p>
<p Align=left>Other Countries, such as Tunisia have approached international
Arbitration in a variety of ways, such as adopting parts of the UNCITRAL Model
Law together with provisions taken directly from the 1958 United Nations
Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (commonly
referred to as the New York Convention). At national level, following the
promulgation of the Tunisian Arbitration Code<sup>49</sup> the Tunisian law on
arbitration observed an improvement of the knowledge of Tunisian lawyers
regarding the Arbitration culture, meanwhile a support of the Arbitration
"centers" at national level offering Arbitration services<sup>5&#176;</sup>. By
contrast, mediation still lacks a well established national legal frame
work.</p>
<p Align=left>Internationally , although international support, academic and
popular literature on ADR methods have proliferated , few studies have been
made as regards ADR' s relationships with the Corporate world, particularly in
merger law.</p>
<p Align=left>The idea proposed in this paper is that a merger can be
successful by implementing a problem solving system that deals with dispute at
an early stage. The implementation of such problem solving system should ,
potentially resolve any disputes in a way that gives parties more creative
business- orientated solutions and satisfaction, thereby preserving their
business relationships, particularly when they are involved in cross- border
transaction and subject to differing national company Laws. The tailoring of
this system in such intricate transactions will demand a great deal of
negotiation between draftsmen, in order to avoid the main problems that are
likely to arise. There will be situations when it may be</p>
<p Align=left class=notes><sup>49</sup> Tunisian Arbitration Code promulgated by law
n&#176;93-24 dated April 26<sup>th</sup> , 1993</p>
<p Align=left class=notes><sup>5&#176;</sup> The local and international Arbitration Center
"AL-INSAF" founded on may 24 1995 in pursuance of the law n&#176; 93/42 dated
April 26 1993 which promulgated the Tunisian Code of Arbitration. The center is
operated by a highly qualified staff composed of the best lawyers and judges in
the countries.</p>
<p Align=left>advantageous for the contracting parties to specify different
procedures to handle special disputes that arise from the same transaction. The
circumstances in which they will be utilized can often be formalized in the
merger contract.</p>
<p Align=left>All these considerations raise a key question: how implementing
alternative dispute resolution mechanisms during a cross-border merger can be a
resourceful action? Implementing ADR mechanisms during cross-border mergers is
required; however, it could be challenged. Accordingly, an international legal
study in view of the American and the European perspectives will be undertaken
in the following three chapters:</p>
