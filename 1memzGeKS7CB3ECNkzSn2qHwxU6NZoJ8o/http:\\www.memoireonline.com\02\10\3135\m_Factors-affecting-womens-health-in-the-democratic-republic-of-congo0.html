<p Align=left><strong>                         ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>This study was to find out factors affecting women's health in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The objective of the research included:
to identify the major health problems of Women in post-conflict Butembo; to
identify the coping mechanisms used to combat health problems associated with
violence and the major causes preventing use of health care services. The study
was descriptive and mainly qualitative methods in design were used to carry out
and obtain information from the field. These included the use of interviews and
focus group discussions.</p>
<p Align=justify>The findings show that women suffer from the common ailments
found in DRC; that they get very little information concerning their health and
have little extra resources to obtain preventative measures for example ITN. 
The expected result of the study was that people would experience the effects
of war, but such effects were not mentioned.  Nevertheless, data from a local
NGO - FEPSI - show that women suffer some forms of post traumatic shock
syndrome, but in a silent way.  This has to do with lack of awareness but also
with traditional cultural norms. The latter means that &#171;what happens
within the home should be kept into the home&#187;.  General experience however
has shown that such behavior makes the situation only worse. It was therefore
recommended as a way forward that the Ministry of health should focus more on
health promotion and education in order to sensitize the communities on these
various issues.</p>
<p Align=justify>It was also recommended that the health promoters, NGOs and
community development officers should discuss issues of domestic violence and
post traumatic stress symptoms with the people of Butembo district. </p>
<p Align=justify>In conclusion, the district health department should liaise
with other sectors like education, agriculture and water supply services to
streamline health issues concerning Women.</p>

<p Align=center><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p>
<p Align=center><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The researcher based his research on factors affecting women's
health in Democratic Republic of Congo. It is organised chronologically in five
chapters all of which were crucial in the success of this study. </p>
<p Align=justify>According to the Constitution of the World Health Organization
1948, health is defined as `a state of complete physical, mental, emotional,
intellectual, environmental, spiritual health, and social well-being and not
merely the absence of disease or infirmity' (WHO, 2004).</p>
<p Align=justify>In order to justify health it is important not to ignore the
fact that health is fundamental to an individual's well being in many ways and
it is therefore independently valid. The Joint Initiative on the Fight against
Sexual Violence towards Women and Children of the United Nations
documented<sup> </sup>41,225 cases in the provinces of Kivu, Maniema and Kalemi
in DRC since 1998 (WHO and HAC, 2005).</p>
<p Align=justify>Services that address women's needs, especially when they are
subject to sexual violence, will reduce the impact of trauma, rates of
undesired pregnancy, and the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)
and HIV infection. The specific purpose<em> </em>of such programmes is to
establish the best practices for health services that operate in conflict
period so that they promote women's health (with particular attention to the
needs of women exposed to acts of violence); to improving sexual and
reproductive health, reducing risks of HIV infection, and providing effective
health care to those who have acquired HIV and (seeking, where feasible, access
to ARV-based AIDS care). Through Women studies, the inequality between men and
women in health status and decision making has become clearer. The studies
indicate that in most cases women are at a disadvantage (Gender<strong>
</strong>and<strong> </strong>Health<strong> </strong>Promotion, 2007) and
therefore their health special attention needs to be paid to the issues
surrounding in conflict and post conflict. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Women's health and HIV/Aids</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Women are affected by diseases such as Malaria, sexually
transmitted diseases, high-pitched respiratory infections, flu and diarrhoea
(Gender and Development, 2005). On the other hand, women's reproductive health
activities focus primarily on contraception safety and efficacy, fertility,
infertility, and HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. (STDs) 
<A
HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/WomensRH/index.htm" rel="nofollow"><u>http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/WomensRH/index.htm</u></A></p>
<p Align=justify>Women<sup> </sup>from socially and economically backward
groups have lower odds, both of having awareness of AIDS and knowledge of ways
to avoid<sup> </sup>getting the disease (Women's<strong> </strong>Health in
Today's Developing World, 2005). The spread of the epidemic to rural<sup>
</sup>areas presents a need to actively disseminate AIDS related knowledge<sup>
</sup>for health protection. Approaches to<sup> </sup>health promotion that do
not consider differing contextual factors<sup> </sup>are unlikely to succeed.
Therefore, an innovative strategy to disseminate knowledge among disadvantaged
population groups is needed. (Reproductive Health, 2005)</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Factors affecting women's health</strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>War</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>War is one of the factors that have affected Women's health in
Butembo from 1998 to 2003. Due to insecurity, people were forced to leave their
homes in the town and go to the villages for refuge and safety, escaping the
hostilities in Butembo. The women were exposed to sexual violence, rape and
other gender based violence by armed groups and also civilians (FEPSI-NGO,
2007). Sexual and gender based violence (SGBV) remains one of the greatest
threats to Women's Health.<strong> </strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Moreover, in the villages there were no health facilities of
any kind, no food, and no shelter. </p>
<p Align=justify>After the war they returned home unfortunately few health care
units available services were offered so women and their dependants could not
access adequate healthcare, including safe contraceptive methods as a greater
proportion of money was directed to the war. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Societal: culture and patriarchal society</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>People in Butembo are of the Nande ethnic group. Like most
rural people throughout the DRC they speak one language, they have the same
tradition, culture, customs, which are derived from one ancestral line. </p>
<p Align=justify>Among the Nande, Women have less rights in the family meaning
that men are privileged because of cultural beliefs.  In every situation women
have to seek permission from their husbands except when it concerns health
issue whereby women are allowed to seek treatment according to their will.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Butembo</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Butembo, the second town of the province after Goma is
situated in Lubero district, North Kivu province in the Eastern part of
Democratic Republic of the Congo. The citizens living in the town majority is
of Nande by tribe. Since independence 1960, the population has lived in poor
health conditions.</p>
<p Align=justify>The inhabitants here suffer from various types of diseases
such as Malaria, TB, and HIV/AIDS but also reproductive health and
non-communicable diseases, such as those linked to Tobacco smoking. </p>
<p Align=justify>Like most rural people through the country, the population of
Butembo depicts a low to average standard of living. As judged by the current
definition of poverty, which is the situation where one lacks most of the basic
necessities and assets for life or even any means of acquiring them.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Government health facilities</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>As mentioned before, most of the Government health facilities
countrywide have not been maintained or rehabilitated during and after war, and
many health centers and communities lack appropriate medical equipment and
staff (FEPSI-NGO, 2007). The Ministry of Health has recognized the importance
of maintenance and is in the process of developing a National Health
Infrastructure Development and Maintenance Plan (NHIDMP) as the priority for
health.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Study context </strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The study context is characterized by ongoing conflicts where
community systems including health systems are weakened, and easily
overwhelmed. Societal cohesion and the rule of law are undermined. Proposed
responses need to take into account the extreme challenges to their successful
study, development and implementation.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>War and society related to women's health</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>During the war in Butembo health facilities were destroyed and
rundown resulting into a deterioration of women's health. Even after the war
there are still factors affecting women's health. Among these include: Policy
reasons such as poor collaboration between health workers and the local
council; poor planning, and lack of material.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Goal </strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The overall goal<em> </em>of this study is to offer
suggestions that will help improve the impact of health services on the health
of women in post-conflict settings. As said before, services that better
address women's needs, especially when they are subject to violence, will
reduce the impact of trauma, rates of undesired pregnancy, and the incidence of
sexually transmitted diseases and also by ascertaining the effects of the war
on women's health and studying how women's health is after the cessation of
war.  </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Main objective</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>To establish the factors relating to women's health in the
post-conflict situation that promotes women's health with particular attention
to the needs of women exposed to violent acts, improving sexual and
reproductive health, reducing risks of STD infections. While identifying
Different types of health care to those who have acquired, for example HIV/AIDS
and victims of different types of violence or rape.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Specific purpose</strong> </p>
<p Align=justify>1. To identify the major health problems for women in
post-conflict Butembo</p>
<p Align=justify>2. To identify the coping mechanisms used to combat health
problems associated with violence</p>
<p Align=justify>3. To identify the major causes preventing use of health care
services. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION</strong> </p>
<p Align=justify>What are the factors affecting women's health in Butembo
District?</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>HYPOTHESES</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>It is supposed that improving quality of care must begin with
the formation of human resources for health; a formation which should include
value, care process of men and women. However, what might be important is to
provide opportunities to female health workers to come together as women and as
professionals to provide care to the community.</p>
<p Align=justify>Women's health may thus be improved in the way that women
engage themselves in public health services, which can play a big role in
improving quality of care.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Scope of the study</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The scope of this study focused on the factors affecting
women's health, in Butembo, Lubero District as the case study. Data was
obtained from the NGO-FEPSI headquarter 63 Martyrs Road, Butembo town. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Diseases have had profound social and health consequences on
women in Butembo. Sometimes they remain mute and suffer silently from the
diseases and trauma. The outcome of this study will identify how healthcare
delivery can support women after identifying the factors which affect women and
their health. It will also identify healthcare gaps in service delivery, which
once identified can aid health planners and policy makers in provision of
services.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The chapter focused on the researcher's area of study, the
introduction, and the objectives that helped the researcher carry out his study
including the Significance and hypothesis of the study.</p>
<p Align=center><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p>
<p Align=center><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p>


<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc0"></A>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<p Align=justify>Women's health is among the most important problems that
developing countries face. The magnitude of the women's health problem is so
important that it has affected their development. </p>
<p Align=justify>The current concept of women's<strong> </strong>health should
be expanded to embrace the full spectrum<sup> </sup>of health experienced by
women, and preventive and remedial<sup> </sup>approaches to the major
conditions that afflict women. Allocation<sup> </sup>of health service
resources should be aligned with the epidemiological<sup> </sup>realities of
these threats to women's<strong> </strong>health<strong>,<sup>
</sup></strong>(Women's<strong> </strong>Health in Today's Developing World,
2005).</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>What are the causes preventing use of health
care?</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Income and loss of employment leads to poverty that can become
rampant and widespread in such a way that one cannot easily sustain him/herself
and provide the basic needs like food, shelter and maintenance of a good
quality of health, especially in post-conflict communities. The challenge is to
define the essential elements of women's reproductive health services, upgrade
the services as appropriate and reduce women's risks of disease and suffering,
(WHO, 2004).</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>What are the factors affecting women's
health?</strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>WAR-effects on women's health</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>War is one of the major factors that affect Women's health.
Discrimination and gender difference are the most brutal consequences of war on
women's health. In war areas women are the most affected, especially those wars
in which the world's media take only token interest. For example, the incidence
of rape in Darfur, DRC, Northern Uganda and Sierra Leone may never be known,
let alone carry any hope of accountability. (

<p Align=justify>According to UHB (2000) the overall goal of organizations in
war, such as local and international NGO's is to improve the impact of health
services on the health of women caught up in violent conflict, or post-conflict
settings. Services that better address women's needs especially when they are
subject to situations like sexual violence will reduce the impact of trauma,
rates of undesired pregnancy, and the incidence of sexually transmitted disease
and HIV infection, (Uganda Health Bulletin, 2000).</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>SOCIETAL: CULTURE, PATRIACHIAL SOCIETY AND
HEALTH</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>In the majority of poor countries only a small proportion of
women will be engaged in paid employment which itself is likely to be of low
quality, (Senators and<strong> </strong>Representative, 2006).</p>
<p Align=justify>According to the Global Policy (2006) in Asia a relative
important proportion of women are able to find employment. This is quite
different from Congo and for instance few women in Butembo think of having
work. Otherwise, they are mostly focused on agricultural work and business,
while Asian Women focus more on the business model of global corporations,
which typically engages them at the bottom of the production chain, for example
in factories. </p>
<p Align=left><em><u>HIV/AIDS</u></em></p>
<p Align=justify>According to the Executive director of UNFPA - [Ms.Thoraya
Obaid], (2007) - HIV/AIDS constitute another big area of health factors
affecting Women. Part of it is that developing countries are facing critical
shortfalls of contraceptives and condoms. The solution to the HIV problem is
the combination of sex education, abstinence, couples remaining faithful to
their partners and greater use of condoms.</p>
<p Align=justify><em><u>Gender Inequalities</u></em></p>
<p Align=justify>According to UNFPA (2005) gender inequalities need to be
addressed including violence, limited access to education and violation of
human rights. When women are educated, healthy and employed, and able to make
decisions about childbearing and reproductive life, everyone benefits. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>What are the major health problems for
women?</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>According to WHO (2005; 2007)&nbsp;being poor or being a woman
was often a reason for being discriminated. Worldwide, millions of women are
unable to protect themselves from HIV infection due to lack of prevention
methods that can be controlled by women, causing unnecessary suffering and
death.  One of the most urgent actions is to increase funding for vaccine
development, proper nutrition and invest in education that will ensure they are
accepted within communities.</p>
<p Align=justify>The Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination
Against Women [adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by
General Assembly resolution 34/180 of 18 December 1979 entry into force 3
September 1981, in accordance with articles 27(1)] stipulates that &#171;the
discrimination against women violates the principles of equality of rights and
respect for human dignity, is an obstacle to the participation of women, on
equal terms with men, in the political, social, economic field and in the
family and makes more difficult to realise the full development of the
potentialities of women in the service of their countries and of
humanity&#187;, (The conventions on the elimination of all forms of
discrimination against women, 1981). </p>
<p Align=justify><u>http://www.mafhoum.com/press/51s4.htm</u>,October 2007</p>
<p Align=justify>According to Farr, (2002) health is not a gender issue, but a
poverty issue. It effects men as well as women and depends on the area they
live. For this to be seen as a woman issue is typical of real discrimination.
</p>
<p Align=justify>Women are the bearers of new life. In order to protect future
lives we must protect women. Promoting women's health physically and mentally
should be a top priority internationally. A progressive society can be measured
by the way that its women are treated. If women are healthy then their children
and families will have a greater chance of also being healthy and productive,
(Gender Perspectives on Small Arms and Light Weapons, 2002).</p>
<p Align=justify><u>http://www.iansa.org/women</u>, (September 2007)</p>
<p Align=justify>There is no excuse for this grave human inequality. Women
should no longer be valued as second class citizens. If all the money that has
been poured into aid for third-world countries was used for a common benefit,
there would be no hunger and health problem in the world today.</p>

<p Align=justify><em><u>Gender and health promotion</u></em></p>
<p Align=justify>According to &Ouml;stlin<sup> </sup>et al, (2007) women and
men are different as regards their biology, the roles<sup> </sup>and
responsibilities that society assigns to them and their<sup> </sup>position in
the family and community. These factors have a great<sup> </sup>influence on
causes, consequences and management of diseases<sup> </sup>and ill-health and
on the efficacy of health promotion policies<sup> </sup>and programmes.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>What mechanism can be taken to combat health
problems?</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Health promoting interventions aimed at ensuring<sup>
</sup>safe and supportive environments, healthy living conditions<sup>
</sup>and lifestyles, community involvement and participation, access<sup>
</sup>to essential facilities and to social and health services need<sup>
</sup>to address these differences between women and men, boys and<sup>
</sup>girls in an equitable manner in order to be effective,  (Gender<strong>
</strong>and<strong> </strong>Health<strong> </strong>Promotion, 2007).</p>
<p Align=justify>The different health measures showed<sup> </sup>considerable
variation in strengths of association with health related<sup> </sup>factors,
most noticeably so with gender and socio-economic status.<sup> </sup>The choice
of health measures in population studies should comply<sup> </sup>with the
intention to analyze its associations with any of those<sup> </sup>related
factors, or, in reverse, with the wish to prevent their<sup> </sup>confounding
properties, (Health Measures, 2007).</p>
<p Align=justify>Extending the definition of women's<strong> </strong>health to
include<sup> </sup>a concern for chronic diseases is critical if the needs of
women<sup> </sup>in less developed nations are to be met. In less developed
countries,<sup> </sup>chronic diseases are the most important cause of female
death<sup> </sup>even during childbearing years and for women with young
families.<sup> </sup>Development agencies and private philanthropy must begin
to<sup> </sup>fund the studies that will further refine our understanding<sup>
</sup>of the role of chronic diseases in women's<strong> </strong>health in the
developing<sup> </sup>world, (Women's<strong> </strong>health in today's
developing world, 2005).</p>
