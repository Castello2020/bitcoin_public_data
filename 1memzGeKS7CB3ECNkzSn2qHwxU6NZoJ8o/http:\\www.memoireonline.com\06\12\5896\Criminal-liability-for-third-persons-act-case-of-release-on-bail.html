<h1 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc60754026"></A><A NAME="_Toc60816848"></A><A
NAME="toc4"></A>CHAP. O. INTRODUCTION  </h1>

<p Align=justify><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Every society must organize a system for responding to crime.
Criminal law involved in this reaction by punishing behaviors that violate
social values it protects<sup>1<a name="fnref1"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn1">*</A>)</sup>. Criminal law is divided into two parties: general
criminal law and special criminal law.<br>According to Patrick Canin, general
criminal law is a branch of criminal law which aims to study <strong>the
liability</strong>, the latter being defined as the obligation of a person
criminally liable for his actions. It determines all the general rules relating
to the offense and the criminal sanction<sup>2<a name="fnref2"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn2">*</A>)</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>The Rwandan penal code codified in 1977 by decree law No21/77
of 1/8august 1977 considers as the part of general criminal law the first 150
articles<sup>3<a name="fnref3"></a>(<A HREF="#fn3">*</A>)</sup>. They indicate
the common rules applicable to all crimes, such as the general constitutive
elements of the crime, an attempt to commit a crime, the criminal
participation, mitigation and aggravating circumstances, excuses and
justifications for commission of a crime. Therefore, the special criminal law
can be defined as a branch of criminal law that defines each criminal offence
and its specific constitutive elements as well as punishment<sup>4<a
name="fnref4"></a>(<A HREF="#fn4">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>The board purpose of criminal law are , of course, to make
people do what society regards as desirable and to prevent them from doing what
society considers to undesirable. Since criminal law is framed in terms of
imposing punishment for bad conducts, rather than of grating rewards for good
conduct, the emphasis is more on the prevention of the undesirable than on the
encouragement of the desirable<sup>5<a name="fnref5"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn5">*</A>)</sup>. The criminal procedure is used in order to prosecute
and to find the guilt of a person who is presumed to commit an offence,
thereafter the penalties are incurred personally by the offender.</p>
<p Align=justify> In some countries the penalties can be executed by a person
other than the accused; for example in England in case of release on bail where
a surety can be tried if the accused escapes the justice. When the accused was
released on bail he and his sureties were said to be bound &#171;body for
body&#187;<sup>6<a name="fnref6"></a>(<A HREF="#fn6">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>Among the punishments provided with by the penal code, the
fines are included, and then this topic &#171;<strong>the criminal liability
for third person's act: case of release on bail and execution of
bond</strong>&#187; will be focusing to the punishment of fine, known as penal
sanction. Indeed, fines are sometimes not personal in Rwandan criminal justice
system.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong> </strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>In civil law, there exist cases of liability for others' act
(responsibility for the parents because of their minors living with them,
craftsmen because of the apprentices, of the principals because of their
employees). </p>
<p Align=justify> There is the criminal liability because of others' act, when
the law provides the payment of a fine by a person in place of the author of an
offence<sup>7<a name="fnref7"></a>(<A HREF="#fn7">*</A>)</sup>. It is the case
of the articles 103 and 104 of the law No 13/2004 of the 17/5/2004 establishing
code of criminal procedure O.G special N� of the 30/<strong>07</strong>/2004,
modified and complemented by law n� 20/2006 of the 22/04/2006, O.G special  n�
of May 27, 2006, which states that a Judge or Magistrate who orders for
detention pending trial, may release the accused <strong>on bail</strong> by
requiring him or her to execute a bond  which guarantees the appearance of the
accused whenever required in court as well as payment of damages arising from
the offence, property to be restituted <strong>and fines<sup>8<a
name="fnref8"></a>(<A HREF="#fn8">*</A>)</sup></strong>. Bail may be in form of
bond or of a person standing as surety<sup>9<a name="fnref9"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn9">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>Article 749 et759 of the code of the France criminal procedure
state that in case of voluntary inexecution of one or more judgments to
punishment of fine in criminal matter or correctional matter for an offence
punished by imprisonment, including in case of voluntary inexecution of
judgments to penal taxes or customs, the judge of  application can order, under
the conditions envisaged by this title, a judicial constraint (contrainte
judiciaire) consisting of an imprisonment of which the duration is fixed by
this magistrate within the limit maximum fixed by the law according to the
amount of fine or of their cumulated amount. The individuals against whom the
constraint was marked can prevent some or put an end to some effects either
<strong>by paying or consigning a sufficient sum to extinguish their debt, or
by providing </strong>a good and valid surety. A surety is allowed by the
qualified public accountant. The surety must be released in the month, or else
it can be sued<sup>10<a name="fnref10"></a>(<A HREF="#fn10">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>The artcle17 of the constitution of the republic of Rwanda
states that the criminal liability is personal<sup>11<a name="fnref11"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn11">*</A>)</sup>. The fine is the obligation to the condemned to pay
to the State as penal sanction, an amount of money<sup>12<a
name="fnref12"></a>(<A HREF="#fn12">*</A>)</sup>. The article of criminal
procedure said above as its purpose is to provide that the accused person can
escape the justice and then the surety shall cover the failure of accused.</p>
<p Align=justify>Under the terms of provisions of various legislations
mentioned above, many problems arise: </p>
<p Align=justify>-The person who stands as a surety of the accused or convicted
person for the payment of the fine is not charged of criminal liability for an
act of accused?</p>
<p Align=justify>-That kind of suretiship doesn't violate the constitutional
principle of the personality of criminal liability?</p>
<p Align=justify> - Can a person substitute another in the execution of
criminal punishment?</p>
<p Align=justify>-in case of no payment of fine, the surety can be submitted to
legal constraint provided with by article 223 para 2 of code of criminal
procedure?</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>HYPOTHESIS</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>In accordance with the provisions of the constitution of the
republic of Rwanda as the fundamental law, in its article 17 which states that
the criminal liability is personal; the legislator should have provided that in
case of guarantee the person who is held surety of the accused will be
responsible only with damages and interests and another court fees other than
fine. In principle no one is liable of any punishment unless the punishment
from his act. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>TOPIC INTEREST </strong></p>
<p Align=justify>This topic will significantly help to avoid the contradiction
of law and to make people know the person who is criminally liable of an
offence committed. The topic will clarify how the penal sanctions are executed
and the persons liable to execute them. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The methodology to be used in the present work is a critical
analysis approach which will help us to criticize the articles 103 and 104 of
the law No 13/2004 of the 17/5/2004 establishing code of criminal procedure, as
modified up to date. We will also use comparative and documentary method.</p>
<p Align=justify><strong>TOPIC DELIMITATION and SCOPE</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>The topic is limited to public law domain, especially in
criminal procedure under Rwandan law. It is based on criminal liability in case
of release on bail and execution of bond.<strong> </strong></p>
<p Align=justify><strong>SUBDIVISION OF WORK</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>This work is divided in two chapters. Chapter one will
relating to general considerations of criminal liability, chapter two will
concerns release on bail and the execution of sanctions after release of
accused, and the work will end by general conclusion and recommendations. </p>

Realization of an offence </h3>

<p Align=justify>An offence is called as such because of certain required
conditions that must be fulfilled the missing of any the act is not offence.
Through the definition given by law any act is qualified as such.</p>


<h4><A NAME="toc8"></A>I.1.1.1. definition of an offence </h4>

<p Align=justify>An offense is an act or omission provided and punished by the
law through a specific       penalty or security measure<sup>13<a
name="fnref13"></a>(<A HREF="#fn13">*</A>)</sup>. Penal code of Rwanda adds to
that above definition  that penalty must be provided before the commission of
infraction<sup>14<a name="fnref14"></a>(<A HREF="#fn14">*</A>)</sup></p>


<h4><A NAME="toc9"></A>I .1.1.2. constitutive elements of offences </h4>


<h5><A NAME="toc10"></A>I.1.1.2.1. Legal element </h5>

<p Align=justify><strong><em> </em></strong>An act or omission is an offense
if, and when the preexisting law has provided for and punished it as such. It
is the principle of legality of sentences and penalties often explained by
Latin maxim "nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege" (there is no crime or
punishment without legal text). This principle is also one of the essential
guarantees of  individual freedom, indeed, the citizen is protected against
arbitrary of the judge<sup>15<a name="fnref15"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn15">*</A>)</sup>.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>


<h5><A NAME="toc11"></A>I.1.1.2.2. material element </h5>

<p Align=justify>Material element is the project that the person envisages for 
committing a crime; it is sometimes the passage towards the act<sup>16<a
name="fnref16"></a>(<A HREF="#fn16">*</A>)</sup>.<u> </u></p>
<p Align=justify>The material act for existence of an offence is often a
positive act; an action. (Example: the murder section 311 and following of the
penal code). Therefore, it may be also an omission; a refusal to act. (Ex:
failure to assist a person in danger Article 256 of the PC Rwandans)</p>
<p Align=justify>The offense requires execution of material element. Individual
freedom is protected by criminal protective law; no one can be punished for a
simple thought. An externalization of that thought, for the realization of a
material act is necessary. The legislator defines the criminal conduct  (for
murder, giving death to the victim and for the theft, the act of removing the
property belongs to another).  When the person comes to an end of his action
and performs the material act, the offense is committed. However, when he was
stopped before the realization of this element, the crime is only
attempted<sup>17<a name="fnref17"></a>(<A HREF="#fn17">*</A>)</sup>. 
<strong><em>             </em></strong></p>



<h6><A NAME="toc12"></A>  attempted offences</h6>

<p Align=justify>Forms of offences changes following the occurrence of
development and social modification. Therefore, the material element of the
offense must also be studied according to the development<sup>18<a
name="fnref18"></a>(<A HREF="#fn18">*</A>)</sup>. Criminal law is involved at
all stages of the process. But the attempted offense is a special type of
offense, independent of the committed offense. It is not the offense that the
individual intended to commit, it is neither an incomplete offense nor an
imperfect offense: it has its own individuality<sup>19<a name="fnref19"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn19">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>The final commission of offense requires the completion of
actual result for the substantive (material) offenses, which is not the case in
attempted offenses<sup>20<a name="fnref20"></a>(<A HREF="#fn20">*</A>)</sup>.
</p>
<p Align=justify>Indeed, the attempt is an effort to commit an illegal act. The
legislator has defined that the attempt is punishable when the resolution to
commit an offense has been manifested by external acts and the suspension or
lack of effect of beginning the execution is due to independent causes of
author<sup>21<a name="fnref21"></a>(<A HREF="#fn21">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify> Therefore, if the author withdraws and voluntarily renounces
his criminal intentions, the attempt is not punishable<sup>22<a
name="fnref22"></a>(<A HREF="#fn22">*</A>)</sup>.  The mens rea (guilty intent)
of ??the perpetrator of an attempted offense and of a committed offense is
same<sup>23<a name="fnref23"></a>(<A HREF="#fn23">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>The attempt of felony and infringement is considered as felony
or infringement itself and it is punishable even if the intended act is not
achieved<sup>24<a name="fnref24"></a>(<A HREF="#fn24">*</A>)</sup>. The attempt
is punishable only if the commencement of execution has been interrupted and
contrarily, there is no attempt if the author of the action stopped himself. By
criminalizing the attempt, the legislature moves, in fact, the legal outcome of
the implementation phase of the prohibited physical act (the act for the flight
subtraction of the thing belonging to another) at the beginning phase of
implementation ( the fact of breaking into a house to commit theft). In terms
of criminal policy, the criminalization of attempt is relevant as behaviors
that can lead to the final consumption of an offense shall be seized before the
occurrence of the actual result<sup>25<a name="fnref25"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn25">*</A>)</sup>.  </p>



<h6><A NAME="toc13"></A>             committed offences </h6>

<p Align=justify>The offense is committed when the act done by the author
contains all required elements of the offense as specified in the definition of
offense prescribed by the law<sup>26<a name="fnref26"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn26">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>The purposes and modalities of consumption are different. The
conduct prohibited by the law can be an act or omission. The offense of
commission or action consists in performing a positive act which is prohibited
by law. The person has done what the law forbids (kill, steal or defame). The
offense by omission is a negative act of execution, that is to say the failure
to accomplish what the law orders (not to save a person who is in a dangerous
state, not to report crimes)<sup>27<a name="fnref27"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn27">*</A>)</sup>.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>


<h5><A NAME="toc14"></A>I.1.1.2.3. moral element </h5>

<p Align=justify>The occurrence of a criminal act is not sufficient to engage
the criminal responsibility of the author. Indeed, it is still necessary that
the agent has free will to do so. In other words, the agent must be able to
account for his actions. It is moral imputabilty  or moral attribution to the
person, that is to say, the attachment of an offense against a person who may
be held liable for his actions. Thus, it is necessary that the agent has
committed a criminal act, it is issue of culpability. The moral imputabilty is
external to the offense, while guilt is a component<sup>28<a
name="fnref28"></a>(<A HREF="#fn28">*</A>)</sup>. The criminal law does not
punish automatically unlawful acts because it is not enough. There must have
been the will of the author or his voluntary failure. It is the intellectual
element of offense often called moral or psychological element<sup>29<a
name="fnref29"></a>(<A HREF="#fn29">*</A>)</sup>.  </p>



<h6><A NAME="toc15"></A>           imputability</h6>

<p Align=justify> The criminal intent, supposes the will directed to a result
that he knows illegal. The intentional act is an act of will but the act of
will is not necessarily intentional, because it may be constitutive of
imprudence or negligence<sup>30<a name="fnref30"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn30">*</A>)</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>The legal concept of criminal imputability can be
ethimologically defined from the Latin term ``imputare``, meaning ``to put on
the account of'', thus, it supposes the existence of free will and the lucid
intelligence of author<sup>31<a name="fnref31"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn31">*</A>)</sup></p>



<h6><A NAME="toc16"></A>             guilt</h6>

<p Align=justify>Guilt is a link between the offender to his act. Guilt is
characterized by the will to commit the offense knowingly, it is guilty
intent<sup>32<a name="fnref32"></a>(<A HREF="#fn32">*</A>)</sup>.</p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="_Toc60754030"></A><A NAME="_Toc60816852"></A><A NAME="toc17"></A>I.1.2
The person who acts</h3>


<h4><A NAME="toc18"></A>I.1.2.1.author </h4>

<p Align=justify>The author of an offense is anyone who shall directly execute
the offense<sup>33<a name="fnref33"></a>(<A HREF="#fn33">*</A>)</sup>.  The
author is one who performs the unlawful acts. Indeed, the doctrine
distinguishes the perpetrator (material author) of the offense, that one who
carries out the elements of the offense,  and the instigator (moral or
intellectual author)  of that one who determines people to perform material act
without executing him/herself<sup>34<a name="fnref34"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn34">*</A>)</sup>.  </p>
<p Align=justify>Material author is that one who personally performs material
acts constituting the offense, for example that one who removes the property of
another in theft.  Contrarily to material author, intellectual author is that
one who, by his willful or negligent conduct, let someone who is under his
authority and supervision, commit a crime<sup>35<a name="fnref35"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn35">*</A>)</sup>. </p>


<h4><A NAME="toc19"></A>I.1.2.2.accomplice </h4>

<p Align=justify>Accomplices of a crime are those who knowingly have provided a
useful support but not necessary, in commission of offence. Penal code defines
an accomplice as any person knowingly, will by assistance, donation, promise,
instructions, publicity, instigation,....... provoke the commission of a crime
or will not report an offender<sup>36<a name="fnref36"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn36">*</A>)</sup>. The accomplice and author are submitted to the same
penalties and the latter   can be prosecuted even if the author of crime is not
prosecuted<sup>37<a name="fnref37"></a>(<A HREF="#fn37">*</A>)</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify> Complicity requires the existence of punishable principle,
act there will never be the complicity without that act<sup>38<a
name="fnref38"></a>(<A HREF="#fn38">*</A>)</sup>.  Indeed, the accomplice is
considered as such and liable when and where the offence aided, abetted, or
procured once is committed<sup>39<a name="fnref39"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn39">*</A>)</sup>.  </p>


<h4><A NAME="toc20"></A>I.1.2.3. co author </h4>

<p Align=justify>Coauthors are those who are on the crime scene; accomplices
are those behind the scenes. Those involved in the offense are co-authors;
those who have given some means of offense are only accomplices<sup>40<a
name="fnref40"></a>(<A HREF="#fn40">*</A>)</sup>. There may be two or more
principals, joint principals, in the same crime; therefore, there may be more
than one cause of an actus reus and more than one causer, they are
coauthors<sup>41<a name="fnref41"></a>(<A HREF="#fn41">*</A>)</sup>.</p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="_Toc60754031"></A><A NAME="_Toc60816853"></A><A
NAME="toc21"></A>I.1.3.consecration of principle of criminal liability of moral
persons</h3>

<p Align=justify>The involvement of corporations in diverse aspects of daily
life has expended because their number has grown, and the pressure for the
imposition of criminal liability for their wrongdoing has increased<sup>42<a
name="fnref42"></a>(<A HREF="#fn42">*</A>)</sup>.  According to PATRICK Cannin,
it is impossible to impose an infraction to a moral person because the
principle of specificity of corporations was considered as an obstacle to
criminal responsibility and expend the social character. Indeed, the principle
of personality of penalties is opposed to the condemnation of a moral person,
therefore, physical persons who compose it will undergo the penalties despite
they did not take part to the offence<sup>43<a name="fnref43"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn43">*</A>)</sup>. But Roger BERNALDINI suggests that the principle of
personality of penalties cannot prevent moral person to be criminally
responsible and punished<sup>44<a name="fnref44"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn44">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>Through those amalgam ideas one can wonder when an offence is
committed by a corporation or a moral person?</p>
<p Align=justify>In case  the offence is committed for interest of that moral
person<sup>45<a name="fnref45"></a>(<A HREF="#fn45">*</A>)</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>A crime can be committed for corporation's interest in two
cases: </p>
<p Align=justify>Primo, when it benefits from the committed crime; for example,
industrial spy is a kind of offence which can be committed for the benefits and
interests of corporation<sup>46<a name="fnref46"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn46">*</A>)</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>Secundo, if an offence has been committed by its organs or its
representatives. Criminal responsibility of moral person is only engaged by
physical persons because the latter are its conscience and minds<sup>47<a
name="fnref47"></a>(<A HREF="#fn47">*</A>)</sup>. When any statute makes
corporate liability an offence for a person to do or omit to do something, that
offence is capable of commission by a corporation, unless the contrary is
provided<sup>48<a name="fnref48"></a>(<A HREF="#fn48">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>Therefore, criminal liability of moral person does not exclude
that of physical persons who are authors or accomplices to the same
acts<sup>49<a name="fnref49"></a>(<A HREF="#fn49">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>Indeed, even if penal code of Rwanda has not any provisions to
punish moral persons, the Rwandan legislator did not forget their criminal
responsibility. That why the law No 07/2009 of 27/04/2009 relating to companies
contains dispositions relating to penal sanctions applicable to the companies;
from article 361 to 364.</p>


<h4><A NAME="toc22"></A>I.1.3.1. legal regime of criminal liability of moral
person</h4>

<p Align=justify>A corporation is a legal person but it has no physical
existence. As a legal entity, a corporation may be placed under a duty to
conduct itself in particular way on pain of criminal sanction for non
compliance. The type of case where it is most obviously proper that a
corporation should be liable arises where a statute imposes a duty upon a
corporation to act and non action is taken<sup>50<a name="fnref50"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn50">*</A>)</sup>. Aside from those cases in which the duty is
specifically imposed on the corporation as a legal person, prosecuting the
corporation within the orthodox model of criminal law an actus reus and mens
rea with absence of defenses creates difficulties since the corporate legal
entity cannot either act or form an intention of any kind except through its
directors or employees. The criminal law's solution to the lack of corporate
body to perform the actus reus and mind capable of forming mens rea has been to
treat the minds and bodies of the officers and servants of the corporation as
supplying its mental and physical capacities<sup>51<a name="fnref51"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn51">*</A>)</sup>.</p>

2.1 objective causes or justifications of non responsibility </h3>

<p Align=justify>The objective reasons for excluding criminal responsibility,
or granting excuses, are external circumstances to the offender. The act
committed is qualified as an offense, but in presence of one of these causes,
the offence loses that qualification. The perpetrator cannot be charged of
criminal or civil liability<sup>52<a name="fnref52"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn52">*</A>)</sup>. </p>


<h4><A NAME="toc25"></A>            I. 2.1.1 justifications resulting  from the
order to commit a crime </h4>

<p Align=justify>The order of law or lawful authority has the effect of
removing criminal liability to any person who claims for it<sup>53<a
name="fnref53"></a>(<A HREF="#fn53">*</A>)</sup>.<em><u> </u></em></p>


<h5><A NAME="toc26"></A>            I.2.1.1.1.order of the law    </h5>

<p Align=justify>The performance of the act required by the law or regulation
justifies the perpetrator. Thus, the physician who denounced to the health
authority communicable diseases known to him does not commit a breach of
confidentiality as the law requires it to do so. Obviously, the justification
of the act plays only if the agent discloses within the strict limit imposed by
the law<sup>54<a name="fnref54"></a>(<A HREF="#fn54">*</A>)</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify> It is the case of article 70 of Rwandan penal code, which
punishes the disclosure of professional secrecy, it states also that there are
certain cases the disclosure of professional secrecy is allowed. Therefore,
there is not any offence when the act committed is ordered by the law or a
legitimate authority<sup>55<a name="fnref55"></a>(<A HREF="#fn55">*</A>)</sup>.
  Thus, the article 327 of penal code shows clearly that order of the law is
cause of non criminal responsibility. It states that without prejudice of
article 325 and 326, there is no criminal liability of a physician who
practices the abortion or a woman who gives her consent for abortion if all
conditions provided by in this article are fulfilled<sup>56<a
name="fnref56"></a>(<A HREF="#fn56">*</A>)</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>In some cases, for example, the arrest of a thief in case of
red- handed is  obligation to every citizen<sup>57<a name="fnref57"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn57">*</A>)</sup>. Code of criminal procedure in its article 33 states
that if a person is caught red handed or taken to be committing an offence, any
person is allowed to arrest an offender in case of failure of the judicial
police officers<sup>58<a name="fnref58"></a>(<A HREF="#fn58">*</A>)</sup>.</p>


<h5><A NAME="toc27"></A><A NAME="toc28"></A><A NAME="toc29"></A><A
NAME="toc30"></A>I. 2.1.1.2. command of a legitimate authority</h5>

<p Align=justify>By lawful authority, means any public authority, whether
administrative, judicial or military. But a private authority (an employer, a
parent) cannot be considered as legitimate authority in the meaning of the law.
Indeed, the act ordered by legitimate authority must, of course comply with the
law<sup>59<a name="fnref59"></a>(<A HREF="#fn59">*</A>)</sup>. The authority is
legitimate when exercised within the limits or within jurisdiction conferred to
him/her by law<sup>60<a name="fnref60"></a>(<A HREF="#fn60">*</A>)</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify> The question is where the legitimate authority orders an act
contrary to law. The subordinate should or not perform the act? </p>
<p Align=justify>The doctrine proposed several theories:</p>
<p Align=justify> <strong>The theory of passive obedience</strong> focuses on
discipline, the subordinate must respect all orders, even illegal, and the act
done is then justified<sup>61<a name="fnref61"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn61">*</A>)</sup>. The system of passive obedience is invoked
particularly in the military hierarchy, as we know, discipline is the main tool
of armies<sup>62<a name="fnref62"></a>(<A HREF="#fn62">*</A>)</sup>.  </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Theory of rational obedience or intelligent</strong>
<strong>bayonets</strong> (l'<strong>ob&eacute;issance
raisonn&eacute;e</strong>  ou <strong>ba&iuml;onnettes intelligentes</strong>
ou encore des <strong>manches de lustrine
r&eacute;fl&eacute;chies</strong>)&nbsp;:  Considers that subordinate have to
appreciate the legality of orders before acting,  so, an illegal order does not
entail any justification<sup>63<a name="fnref63"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn63">*</A>)</sup>.  </p>
<p Align=justify>Intelligent bayonets, bear although, controversial sense, that
why the people must trust in their judgments. If the order is manifestly
illegal of course, obedience to this order does not fit into the context of a
defense<sup>64<a name="fnref64"></a>(<A HREF="#fn64">*</A>)</sup>.  </p>
<p Align=justify><strong>Intermediate theory: </strong>it distinguishes between
the manifestly unlawful order and the order in which the illegality is not
obvious. We must obey at the second but we should not obey the first. This is
the third theory that was selected by many criminal codes<sup>65<a
name="fnref65"></a>(<A HREF="#fn65">*</A>)</sup>.  </p>
<p Align=justify>The Rwandan penal code has preferred the intermediate theory.
Article 229 of Rwandan penal code states that any person accused of an offence
will be exempted of penalty if he/she proves that he/she have acted on command
of a superior legitimate authority; then ,the penalty will be pronounced
against the superior. Therefore, the subordinate will be exempted only if the
order is not manifestly illegal. If the order is manifestly illegal, the
subordinate is accomplice. In all cases the superior authority can never escape
the penalty resulting from such offence<sup>66<a name="fnref66"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn66">*</A>)</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>Indeed, superior order is not a defense for accused merely to
show that the act was done by him in obedience to the order of a superior,
whether military or civil. The fact that the person was acting under orders
may, nevertheless be very important<sup>67<a name="fnref67"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn67">*</A>)</sup>. Under international context, the statute of
international court, ICC, provides in article  30 that &#171;<em>the commission
of a crime pursuant to an order of a government or of a superior does not
relieve a person of criminal responsibility unless that person is under a legal
obligation to obey orders of government or the superior in question; the person
did not know that the order was unlawful and that the order was not manifestly
unlawful</em>&#187;<sup>68<a name="fnref68"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn68">*</A>)</sup>.</p>


<h4><A NAME="toc31"></A> I.2.1.2. justifications resulting from the necessity
to commit a crime </h4>


<h5><A NAME="toc32"></A>               1. self defense </h5>

<p Align=justify>A person is justified of self defense if he/she acts  against
unjust aggression to defend him/herself, the third person as well as goods, if
not,  the act would be unlawful. Self-defense is based on the failure of police
authorities to prevent the aggression. It is not an act of private justice, the
purpose is less to punish than to prevent harm<sup>69<a name="fnref69"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn69">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify><strong> </strong>Self-defense is not obligation; it is a
permission of the law, so, we can choose if there is a real choice, not to
defend oneself. The law provides that aggression must be currently envisaged.  
In principle, any infraction ceases to be as such if it is committed in case of
self-defense. Aggression must be current (immediate) and unfair to stay in
self-defense. Self-defense is a defense against aggression, if there is not act
of aggression it is an attack not a defense<sup>70<a name="fnref70"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn70">*</A>)</sup>. There must be a proportion between attack and
defense. Since there must be a proportion between attack and defense, we can
recognize the legitimate defense of property if the harm inflicted in the
attack is comparable to the value, for example, of goods that it
threatened<sup>71<a name="fnref71"></a>(<A HREF="#fn71">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>Unjust aggression is not that one ordered by the legitimate
authority or by the law, it is the aggression against the law<sup>72<a
name="fnref72"></a>(<A HREF="#fn72">*</A>)</sup>. This means that if the
aggression is just, the defense does not legitimate. Self defense is deferent
from necessity state where self defense requires some conditions: aggression
and defense. </p>


<h5><A NAME="toc33"></A>2. necessity in case of an exceptional situation</h5>

<p Align=justify>Necessity is a situation in which a person commit an unlawful
act to avoid an imminent or a current danger that violates a relevant rights.
The person shall choose to commit an offence or to let the occurrence of
danger<sup>73<a name="fnref73"></a>(<A HREF="#fn73">*</A>)</sup>. According to
DAVID Ormerod, the necessity is a situation in which a person is faced with a
choice between two unpleasant alternatives, one involving his committing a
crime and the other some evil to himself or others<sup>74<a
name="fnref74"></a>(<A HREF="#fn74">*</A>)</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>Necessity has the effect of removing criminal liability, but
unlike the other justifications, it does not preclude civil liability of the
agent<sup>75<a name="fnref75"></a>(<A HREF="#fn75">*</A>)</sup>.<u> </u></p>
<p Align=justify>The doctrine in general and certain legislations affirm that
necessity in criminal law is a defense. There is a necessity when an individual
can only escape the evil by committing an offense for protecting his own
legitimate interest or of others. Self-defense is a special case of the
necessity requires to protect the individual himself by committing acts
prohibited by law. But self defense and necessity are different. In
self-defense, the acts are directed against the perpetrator of the aggressing
on the contrary, in the necessity victim is a person totally out of the evil
that threatened the perpetrator of a criminal act<sup>76<a
name="fnref76"></a>(<A HREF="#fn76">*</A>)</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>Necessity state is sometimes confused with moral constraint,
but they are different on where the necessity case do not require external will

causes of non responsibility or causes of non imputability</h3>

<p Align=justify>Being criminally liable, the author must have mental faculties
of thinking and must also have free will to act<sup>77<a name="fnref77"></a>(<A

<h4><A NAME="toc38"></A><A NAME="toc39"></A><A NAME="toc40"></A><A
NAME="toc41"></A>I. 2.2. 1.mental diseases / insanity </h4>

<p Align=justify> There is no criminal responsibility if the defendant was
insane at the time of action, or when he/she was in a state of insanity at the
time of action or if he/she was forced irresistibly<sup>78<a
name="fnref78"></a>(<A HREF="#fn78">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>In case of insanity, there is not any infraction because there
is no moral element, so, the perpetrator cannot be sued or convicted he/she
must be acquitted. Indeed, insanity is a subjective cause of non
liability<sup>79<a name="fnref79"></a>(<A HREF="#fn79">*</A>)</sup>, which
means it does not extend to co-authors and accomplices who were not insane at
the time of commission, the author must be only liable for civil
responsability<sup>80<a name="fnref80"></a>(<A HREF="#fn80">*</A>)</sup>.  </p>
<p Align=justify>All forms of insanity remove the individual control of his
actions committed at such time. Dementia or insanity has the effect of
suppressing consciousness and free will of an individual, and consequently, his
criminal responsibility<sup>81<a name="fnref81"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn81">*</A>)</sup>. The insanity must be total, means that it must have
caused a complete mental disability in mental faculties if not; it could be
considered as mitigating factor<sup>82<a name="fnref82"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn82">*</A>)</sup>.<em><u> </u></em></p>


<h4><A NAME="toc42"></A><A NAME="toc43"></A><A NAME="toc44"></A><A
NAME="toc45"></A>I. 2.2. 2.constraint </h4>

<p Align=justify>The constraint is a psychological cause that removes the
freedom of will. Whether physical or moral, constraint must be irresistible and
come out of the person who invokes it. It will remove the responsibility if the
act of committing the offense was the only way to escape the threat<sup>83<a
name="fnref83"></a>(<A HREF="#fn83">*</A>)</sup>.<em><u> </u></em>In contrary
to neuropsychological or psychiatric disorder (insanity) that destroys the
capacity for discernment, the constraint suppresses the freedom of action of
the agent. </p>
<p Align=justify>Constraint (physical or moral), must have irresistible and
unpredictability characters<sup>84<a name="fnref84"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn84">*</A>)</sup>. The irresistible means it must be absolutely
impossible to be able to resist and to do otherwise he did. On the subject of
unpredictability is considered that the person who was at fault before the
action cannot invoke the cause of non-accountability. A person cannot invoke
the constraint resulting from his or her own fault.</p>
<p Align=justify> The removal of the responsibility or the accountability means
that there is not moral element. Accountability presupposes free will; in case
of constrain the will is not free.  Therefore, the disappearance of the mental
element of author cannot extend to the coauthors and accomplices reason why the
constraint is subjective cause of non imputabililty<sup>85<a
name="fnref85"></a>(<A HREF="#fn85">*</A>)</sup>.<u> </u></p>


<h4><A NAME="toc46"></A>I. 2.2. 3. Minority / infancy</h4>

<p Align=justify>Rwandan penal code provides the age from which the person is
criminally liable. Therefore, minors are classified in two categories: absolute
minors and relative minors, among them some are criminally responsible with
mitigation others are not. </p>
<p Align=justify>Article 77 of Rwandan penal code states that any person aged
at least of fourteen but under eighteen years is criminally liable, but
penalties are decreased comparing to those against adults<sup>86<a
name="fnref86"></a>(<A HREF="#fn86">*</A>)</sup>.  Rwandan penal code did not
state in its provisions if the minor under fourteen are totally
irresponsible.</p>


<h4><A NAME="toc47"></A><A NAME="toc48"></A><A NAME="toc49"></A><A
NAME="toc50"></A>I. 2.2. 4.  Error</h4>

<p Align=justify>The error is not expressly provided for by Rwandan penal code
as a cause of non responsibility. However, in some cases, it is obvious that
the error is likely to remove the element of intent, moral element, and the
question is whether in this case, there will or there will be no penalty.</p>
<p Align=justify>ICC statute or Rome statute provides mistake as a cause
excluding criminal responsibility<sup>87<a name="fnref87"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn87">*</A>)</sup>. Many authors have consider error or mistake as
absence of moral element in commission of a crime.</p>
<p Align=justify>According to LOUIS Marie MUGENZI the imputability
(Accountability) is a prerequisite for criminal liability, it requires
knowledge and the will of the person. That mental element of the offense has as
a mission, to realize the material element of offence<sup>88<a
name="fnref88"></a>(<A HREF="#fn88">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>In general, the error of law has no influence on the criminal
responsibility according to the principle "nemo censetur ignorare legem". 
Thus, the error of fact as an essential constitutive or aggravating element of
offence, modifies and erases even the intention of the offender in respect of
that particular element. It is the case for example in a taxi, a traveler who
makes a mistake of his bag and takes another rather than his/hers; error of the
fact here is an essential element in theft: the ownership of a thing belonging
to others, but the intent is not fraudulent.</p>
<p Align=justify>The mistake of fact may prevent the aggravation of a penalty
resulting from aggravating circumstances<sup>89<a name="fnref89"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn89">*</A>)</sup>. It is the case of a person who kills another while
ignoring that he is his father. Therefore, infraction committed is not
parricide it is homicide. </p>
<p Align=justify>The error on law in general is not retained under the maxim
'nemo censetur ignorare legem' . However, case law have recognized the error of
law, at least when the error relates to an issue of law of course, but that is
not a problem of criminal law, such as it is a mistake of law, commercial and
administrative law<sup>90<a name="fnref90"></a>(<A HREF="#fn90">*</A>)</sup>.
This is the case, for example, an individual who has discovered an object
called a treasure. The treasure does not belong wholly to the discoverer, but
sometimes the individual does not know and he believes he can keep it and he
retains it. In this case he committed the theft in principle, but assumed he
was unaware of the civil law which says that the treasure is not exclusive to
the finder; this error of law will save him from criminal prosecution. </p>
<p Align=justify>It's the same case of an individual who is prosecuted for
adultery when he believed he was no longer married.</p>
<p Align=justify>Mistake of fact is what one encounters in the event or
individual makes a mistake on something or someone. We can take an example of a
pharmacist who is wrong and gives a poison instead of medicine, there is no
poisoning even though the result may be the same. There is a lack of
carefull<sup>91<a name="fnref91"></a>(<A HREF="#fn91">*</A>)</sup>. However the
mistake of fact is irrelevant in respect of infringements by carelessness or
negligence.</p>
<p Align=justify> The mistake on fact focuses the materiality of the act
itself. It is not provided by any text, but the general rule arising from the
case law is that an error of fact excludes the guilt of the agent in terms of
intentional offense if certain conditions are met and if not, it does not
affect the criminal liability of the agent. The error considered can take many
forms: It can be a prerequisite for an offense. It can also consist of behavior
itself. In all these cases, the error is exclusive of intention and the person
is in good faith, not having been aware of the unlawfulness of his/her act.
Here, error is a cause of non guilty.</p>
<p Align=justify>The error would be a cause of non-accountability related to
the psychological element of the offense and especially the knowledge element;
thus, it is the lack of knowledge or consciousness that causes the absence of
free will. This shows that the error, to which we assimilate ignorance, can
demonstrate the good faith of the defendant as penal code has retained the will
in criminal acts<sup>92<a name="fnref92"></a>(<A HREF="#fn92">*</A>)</sup>.</p>

<p Align=justify>The circumstances are usually made outside the offender, but
that may be personal, and they will lead sometimes to mitigate, or to aggravate
penalties. Indeed, when the circumstances leading to aggravation of the
repression, it is necessary that the law has provided, while when it comes to
mitigation, the judge has broad discretion<sup>93<a name="fnref93"></a>(<A

1. aggravating circumstances   </h3>

<p Align=justify>In determining the aggravating circumstances it is therefore
to consider the circumstances, including events surrounding the commission of
the offense.   The Rwandan penal code provides some aggravating causes but they
are not specified clearly. It often mentions them in articles in accordance
with the matter the article is related. Among them we can note baribarian acts,
premeditation, guet apens, recidivism,...........   we can consider one of them
which is recidivism.   <u> </u></p>


<h4><A NAME="toc53"></A>     I.3. 1.1. Recidivism </h4>

<p Align=justify>Once the suspects, defendants or offenders are release from
the jurisdiction of criminal justice they may precede through the criminal
justice system again for a new crime.  </p>
<p Align=justify>Recidivism is a situation where a person already convicted for
a previous offense finally commits a new offense<sup>94<a
name="fnref94"></a>(<A HREF="#fn94">*</A>)</sup>. Here again there must be a
final decision authorizing of res judicata has been made on the first offense.
Recidivism depends on the nature of committed offences and also the time during
which they were committed<sup>95<a name="fnref95"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn95">*</A>)</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>The purpose of recidivism is to aggravate penalties for repeat
offenders. In case of recidivism, the offender will be sentenced a maximum
penalty provided or the penalty can be doubled<sup>96<a name="fnref96"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn96">*</A>)</sup>.  In accordance with penal code, there is not any
recidivism if the penalty pronounced to previous offence was suppressed by
amnesty or rehabilitation<sup>97<a name="fnref97"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn97">*</A>)</sup>.</p>

2. mitigating circumstances</h3>

<p Align=justify>Contrarily to aggravating circumstances, mitigating
circumstances are not provided anywhere in Rwandan criminal code. Rwandan
criminal code have let them to the discretion or appreciation of judges but
judges must motivate their mitigating decisions<sup>98<a name="fnref98"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn98">*</A>)</sup>.  Mitigating circumstances has as mission to diminish
or modify penalties. The penal code provides the manner by which penalties are
modified<sup>99<a name="fnref99"></a>(<A HREF="#fn99">*</A>)</sup>. Provisions
of article 78 and 81 of penal code by analyzing them, we consider that the
provocation is one of mitigating circumstances because they provide that an
offence committed by provocation of the victim will entail the diminution of
penalty<sup>100<a name="fnref100"></a>(<A HREF="#fn100">*</A>)</sup></p>
<p Align=justify>Reducing the sentence does not modify the nature or
qualification of a crime or its legality<sup>101<a name="fnref101"></a>(<A

SANCTIONS</h1>

<p Align=justify>Before a judge declares suspect his/her guilty in final
judgment and before the pronouncing of conviction, there is a long process
through which the suspect is presumed innocent. During that process suspect can
ask for release from custody if he/she is arrested, but a release is not
automatic. Though, he/she can be released or remain provisionally in custody.
His/her release does not mean that if his/her guilt is found he/she will not be
convicted or execute the sentence.  Indeed, she/he must execute it unless
he/she escaped the justice. However, the enforcement authorities have only one
recourse: the pursuit of wealth of the offender or that of his surety in case
of bail, for execution of pecuniary penalties like fines<strong>.</strong></p>

NAME="_Toc60816862"></A>II.1.1. definition of bail </h3>

<p Align=justify><strong>Bail</strong> represents to deliver the defendant to
persons who in a manner prescribed by law, become surety for his appearance in
court. It is also to set a liberty a person arrested or imprisoned on security
being taken for his/her appearance on specified day and place. Thus, bail can
be defined as a monetary amount for or condition of pretrial release from
custody, normally set by judge at the initial appearance<sup>102<a
name="fnref102"></a>(<A HREF="#fn102">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>Bail is also defined as the delivery of a person to another
for keeping and in generally used in reference to one arrested or committed to
prison, upon a criminal process. Such a person is considered to be bailed when
he/she is delivered to another, who becomes her/his surety for appearance at
court to take his trial. The person who thus becomes surety is said to become
bail, and amount itself is also called bail<sup>103<a name="fnref103"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn103">*</A>)</sup></p>
<p Align=justify> Bail allows people who have been arrested to remain out of
jail while waiting for trial. It can be paid by friends, relatives or the
person accused of a crime. In fact any one can bail another person out of
jail<sup>104<a name="fnref104"></a>(<A HREF="#fn104">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>In addition to the above definitions, Rwandan criminal
procedure in its article 101 para.1, considers bail also as provisional
release. It states &#171;<em>in all offences, an accused person or her or his
counsel can at any time apply for bail to the public prosecutor charged with
the preparation of the case or to a judge or magistrate depending on the stage
of investigation</em>&#187; and the article 90 of that code of criminal
procedure states &#171;<em>bail conditions can be ordered when the offence a
person is charged of is a misdemeanor or a felony&#187;.</em></p>

release</h3>


<h4><A NAME="toc59"></A>                2.1. Preventive detention </h4>

<p Align=justify>It is a confinement imposed generally on a defendant in
criminal cases who has threatened to escape or otherwise violate the law while
a waiting trial or disposition, or of a mentally ill person who may harm
himself or other<sup>105<a name="fnref105"></a>(<A HREF="#fn105">*</A>)</sup>.
</p>
<p Align=justify>Preventive detention is ordered by the court on grounds based
on facts and law specifying that the accused has committed an offence. An order
for preventive detention is signed by a magistrate or judge and a court
registrar<sup>106<a name="fnref106"></a>(<A HREF="#fn106">*</A>)</sup>.</p>


<h5><A NAME="toc60"></A>                2.2. Provisional release</h5>

<p Align=justify>The provisional release is a measure that differs from
preventive detention and causes enlargement of the individual, if the retention
or release is accompanied by certain specific obligations, other than a
commitment to meet the convocations, there is submission under control It is
also an action to set free a prisoner conditionally or permanently<sup>107<a
name="fnref107"></a>(<A HREF="#fn107">*</A>)</sup>.    </p>
<p Align=justify>The judge before whom the accused appears may order the
provisional release of an individual for whom preventive detention is
authorized, subject to conditions that may be imposed such as residence in a
specific locality or a prohibition to leave the locality<sup>108<a
name="fnref108"></a>(<A HREF="#fn108">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>The release pending trial is applicable in all jurisdictions,
national or international<sup>109<a name="fnref109"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn109">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>The release may be subject to judicial supervision by granting
a bail bond. The accused prisoner released on bail, remains in custody until he
paid it, and measures of detention continue to apply, including the extension
of detention term. It is the release on bail (<strong>la mise en libert&eacute;
sous caution)<sup>110<a name="fnref110"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn110">*</A>)</sup>.</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>Provisional release can be ordered when the offence is
punishable by less than two years of imprisonment. It is a release as rights
(<strong>mise en libert&eacute; de droit</strong>)<sup>111<a
name="fnref111"></a>(<A HREF="#fn111">*</A>)</sup>.  </p>
<p Align=justify>The judge may ex officio, in hi/her discretion and without any
request of the accused, order the release of an accused, charge for him/her to
appear for all acts of procedure, whenever required and to inform the
investigator of any remove from locality. It is a release ex officio
(<strong>mise en libert&eacute; d'office</strong>)<sup>112<a
name="fnref112"></a>(<A HREF="#fn112">*</A>)</sup>.   </p>
<p Align=justify>The faculty to request for release is an absolute right of a
detained<sup>113<a name="fnref113"></a>(<A HREF="#fn113">*</A>)</sup>.   
However, the release is not a right for the detained but a possibility for the
judge in accordance with his/her sovereign discretion and conscience. It is
facultative release (<strong>mise en libelt&eacute;
facultative</strong>)<sup>114<a name="fnref114"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn114">*</A>)</sup>.   </p>


<h3 class="core">
<A NAME="_Toc60816864"></A><A NAME="toc61"></A>2.3.why a release pending
trial&nbsp;?</h3>

<p Align=justify>The provisional release is in principle a rule and detention
an exception.</p>
<p Align=justify>The pretrial detention is considered as an exceptional measure
because it is deprivation of liberty without the defendant's guilt has not yet
been established and this could lead to consider the detention as an
anticipated penalty<sup>115<a name="fnref115"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn115">*</A>)</sup>.   </p>
<p Align=justify>In principle, <em>every suspect is presumed innocent as long
as his/her guilt is not established<sup>116<a name="fnref116"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn116">*</A>)</sup>.</em> Even in fragrant offense (red handed), the
principle of presumption of innocence is still playing because only the court
after assessing the facts of offense, is entitled to convict<sup>117<a
name="fnref117"></a>(<A HREF="#fn117">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>In the international instruments, the use of pretrial
detention should be restricted because it is a measure of deprivation of
liberty while the latter is a fundamental right internationally recognized, it
is the prohibition of arbitrary or illegal detention<sup>118<a
name="fnref118"></a>(<A HREF="#fn118">*</A>)</sup>.  </p>

Difference between provisional release and Conditional release/ Parole</h3>

<p Align=justify>Conditional release is a discharge based on some conditions,
the failure of which defeats the release. It is also a substitute form of
release from custody subject to applicable statute and rules of parole
board<sup>119<a name="fnref119"></a>(<A HREF="#fn119">*</A>)</sup>.  </p>
<p Align=justify>This definition gives a clear picture that conditional release
can mean both provisional release and parole. The only difference between the
two refers to before conviction, after conviction procedures<sup>120<a
name="fnref120"></a>(<A HREF="#fn120">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>A convicted person is eligible for parole after serving of a
part of his/her conviction and it is granted based on evidence of good
behavior. Parole may be revoked in cases of misconduct or if another offence is
committed during parole, in which case the inmate serves not only the sentence
for the newer offence, but also complete the existing sentence<sup>121<a
name="fnref121"></a>(<A HREF="#fn121">*</A>)</sup>. Parole is an anticipated
release, granted by the administration to a condemned person who incurred one
or more sentences of imprisonment or was put at the government disposal, if
he/she has sufficiently demonstrated good conduct with serious social
rehabilitation<sup>122<a name="fnref122"></a>(<A HREF="#fn122">*</A>)</sup></p>
<p Align=justify>Parole or conditional release is the letting out prisoners
from prison before the legal period of their imprisonment has ended. </p>

<A NAME="toc63"></A>      <A NAME="_Toc60754043"></A><A
NAME="_Toc60816866"></A>II.1.3.Forms of bail  </h3>

<p Align=justify><strong>  </strong>Even if in principle the accused would be
released as long as he/she is presumed innocent rather than to remain in
custody, a release is some times conditional. It can be made either on bond; on
surety or on conditions. </p>


<h4><A NAME="toc64"></A> Bail bond</h4>

<p Align=justify>A bond is a sum of money paid by the defendant in criminal
court to be released pending trial<sup>123<a name="fnref123"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn123">*</A>)</sup>. The accused is released upon payment of a sum of
money or promise of given sum to be paid later for guaranteeing his/her return
or absence for trial. The guarantee can be also given in form of property like
land, house, and so on, and can be paid by another person on behalf of
other<sup>124<a name="fnref124"></a>(<A HREF="#fn124">*</A>)</sup>.  </p>
<p Align=justify>The accused prisoner released on bail, remains in custody
until he paid that money. It is case of prosecution represented by prosecutor
NIBISHAKA Mireille v NTIGIRINZIGO Joseph represented by Me BUGINGO Charles
before lower instance of NGOMA, Joseph was accused of assault and battery
against BIMENYIMANA.  Joseph has pleaded guilty and the court decided to
release him on bail of hundred thousand (100.000 rwfs). The court has decided
that he must pay that bond within two following the date on which the decision
was taken, if not he must be detained in KARUBANDA prison during thirty
(30)days<sup>125<a name="fnref125"></a>(<A HREF="#fn125">*</A>)</sup>.</p>


<h4><A NAME="toc65"></A>   Bail on surety </h4>

<p Align=justify>A surety is a person who is primarily liable for the payment
of another's debt or performance of another's obligation<sup>126<a
name="fnref126"></a>(<A HREF="#fn126">*</A>)</sup>. In accordance with article
104 of criminal procedure a bail can be in form of bond or person standing as a
surety.</p>
<p Align=justify>A surety is responsible to ensure that the accused attends
court as required until the case is over. He/she is also responsible to ensure
that the accused abides by the conditions of his/her release<sup>127<a
name="fnref127"></a>(<A HREF="#fn127">*</A>)</sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>The judge may release the defendant to the custody of some
responsible person, who agrees to exercise custodial supervision and to ensure
responsibility for the defendant's required court appearance<sup>128<a
name="fnref128"></a>(<A HREF="#fn128">*</A>)</sup>. It is the case of
prosecutor v TWAHIRWA Th&eacute;og&egrave;ne and MUKURARINDA J. Bosco, one
director another accountant of school owned by the church UEBR. Both were
accused of issuing cheques without sufficient funds to the school's food
suppliers. For being released they pledged the church UEBR as their
surety<sup>129<a name="fnref129"></a>(<A HREF="#fn129">*</A>)</sup>. One can
wonder if such kind of suretiship is legally allowed in contractual
liability.</p>


<h4><A NAME="toc66"></A>Bail conditions</h4>

<p Align=justify>Article 91 of criminal procedure states that a suspect can be
subjected to one or several bail conditions provided for in article 102 of the
same law. Those conditions are:</p>
<p Align=justify>- To live in a determined location;</p>
<p Align=justify>- Not to travel a prescribed area without prior permission;</p>
<p Align=justify>- Not to travel a specific area or not to be found in certain
location at a given time;</p>
<p Align=justify>- To report at given periods before a public prosecutor or a
public servant;</p>
<p Align=justify>- To appear before a public prosecutor in charge of
preparation of his/her case file or before a judge or magistrate if it is
required to do so;</p>
<p Align=justify>- To present persons of integrity to stand for his/her

<h4><A NAME="toc69"></A>II.2.1.1. Legality </h4>

<p Align=justify>The legality is the application of the constitutional
principle of nulla poena sine lege. </p>
<p Align=justify>It is necessary that the law specifies that any behavior to
such penalty may be imposed, the law is only to provide, and the judge, when
the law has provided, will be legally bound by the command of law. This
principle of legality is a reaction against the arbitrary<sup>131<a

is a reaction against the arbitrary. It is necessary that the penalties

NAME="toc73"></A>II.2.2. CLASSIFICATIONS OF PENALTIES AND TEIR EXECUTION</h3>

<p Align=justify>The Rwandan penal code in its article 26 and 27 classifies
penalties in two categories, principal and accessory penalties. But there is
another category we would take in consideration, complementary penalties in
case of conviction with two different principal penalties. Their execution is
personal and article 226 of criminal procedure prohibits the provisional
execution of judgement.</p>


<h4><A NAME="toc74"></A>         II.2.2.1.Principle penalties  </h4>

<p Align=justify> Penal code article 26 provides types of principal penalties
which are imprisonment, fine and  death penalty but the latter have been
abolished.</p>
<p Align=justify>Principal penalties are those that necessarily must be
pronounced by the judge for a certain offence, there is no criminal conviction
without a principal penalty<sup>134<a name="fnref134"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn134">*</A>)</sup>. </p>


<h5><A NAME="toc75"></A>       - imprisonment</h5>

<p Align=justify>The imprisonment can be temporary or life term and it is
served in prisons<sup>135<a name="fnref135"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn135">*</A>)</sup>.</p>


<h5><A NAME="toc76"></A>        - fine</h5>

<p Align=justify>A fine is pecuniary penalty that consists of paying a certain
sum of money to the public treasury<sup>136<a name="fnref136"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn136">*</A>)</sup>. Article 219 et 280 para1 of Rwandan penal code show
clearly that fine is principal penalty where a person can be convicted of fine
only. </p>
<p Align=justify>Fines are paid to a court clerk within a period of eight days
following a judgment of final conviction<sup>137<a name="fnref137"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn137">*</A>)</sup>.</p>


<h5><A NAME="toc77"></A>-Public interest works</h5>

<p Align=justify>The criminal procedure provides another penalty which can be
considered as principal penalty. It is public interest works provided in
article 225 of criminal procedure which is executed by serving works from which
the public commonly benefit.</p>


<h4><A NAME="toc78"></A>II.2.2.2. complementary penalties </h4>

<p Align=justify>Complementary penalties are those that are not normally
possible to impose without the support of principal sentences. They complement
the main penalty to ensure the best punishment<sup>138<a
name="fnref138"></a>(<A HREF="#fn138">*</A>)</sup>. The complementary penalty
is that one added to the main sentence, as accessory penalty, but unlike the
latter, not automatically the result of condemnation<sup>139<a
name="fnref139"></a>(<A HREF="#fn139">*</A>)</sup>.  They are applied jointly
to the convicted offender.</p>
<p Align=justify>In accordance with article 121 of penal code imprisonment and
fine are complementary, a convicted of this article shall undergo jointly both
penalties.</p>


<h4><A NAME="toc79"></A> II.2.2.3 accessory penalties</h4>

<p Align=justify>Accessory penalties are different from complementary
penalties, they cannot, exist without the support of a main penalty; they are
so closely added to principal penalty automatically without the judge need to
decide<sup>140<a name="fnref140"></a>(<A HREF="#fn140">*</A>)</sup>.  </p>
<p Align=justify>They are additional in ex officio to the main penalty without
mentioning them in the judgment.</p>
<p Align=justify>Penal code provides in its article 27 four types of accessory
penalties.</p>


<h5><A NAME="toc80"></A>               confiscation </h5>

<p Align=justify>The law entitles the state to confiscate any thing which has
been involved in the offence, or which has assisted in its commission, or which
has been produced as a result<sup>141<a name="fnref141"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn141">*</A>)</sup>. </p>


<h5><A NAME="toc81"></A>             - forfeiture </h5>

<p Align=justify>Court may also prohibit criminals form being found in certain
localities, or may order them to live in certain place<sup>142<a
name="fnref142"></a>(<A HREF="#fn142">*</A>)</sup>.    </p>
<p Align=justify>The forfeiture is also qualified as a penalty, but is
nevertheless a measure of safety<sup>143<a name="fnref143"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn143">*</A>)</sup>.  </p>


<h5><A NAME="toc82"></A>             -putting a person at government  disposal
</h5>

<p Align=justify>Any recidivist convicted three times in period of ten years 
by a sentence of at least six months for each one of that three times, he/she
shall be automatically put at government disposal. Art59 penal code. </p>


<h5><A NAME="toc83"></A>            -civic degradation </h5>

<p Align=justify>Civic degradation consists in the removal and exclusion of
convicted from any position, employment or public office, in the deprivation of
the right to vote, election, eligibility, and in general for all civil and
political rights<sup>144<a name="fnref144"></a>(<A

<A NAME="_Toc60754047"></A><A NAME="_Toc60816870"></A><A
NAME="toc84"></A>II.2.3. EXECUTION OF SENTENCE IN CASE OF RELEASE ON BAIL</h3>

<p Align=justify>In principle the execution of penalty must be served by the
convicted offender personally. This is normal such execution can not cause any
problem. A problem arises in case the execution of penal sanction is attributed
to the third person rather than the offender. It the case of a surety pays
fines in place of offender provisionally released on surety bail and thereafter
escapes the justice before final judgment.  </p>


<h4><A NAME="toc85"></A> II.2.3.1. criminal liability for third person's acts
or execution by the surety</h4>

<p Align=justify>In criminal law the general principle is that one is
responsible for the fact that one commits oneself or he/she participated. The
article 260 of Civil Code B III, provides for responsibility of other's act in
cases where the fault was committed by others than those to whom will be also
requested to repair. This is particularly true of fathers and mothers for
damage caused by the faults of their minor children living with them, it is the
same for artisans who have apprentices, and there is primarily the
responsibility of principals for the damage caused by the mistakes of their
employees<sup>145<a name="fnref145"></a>(<A HREF="#fn145">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>Is there an equivalent in criminal law? Many authors have
given their suggestions about it.</p>
<p Align=justify>A French M. Georges Bri&egrave;re de l'Isle said that
according to the principle known as'' personality of punishment and any one is
punished as a result of his personal act''; so if a person is neither the
author nor accomplice in an offense because he/she did not participate, the
principle is that one can not be punished<sup>146<a name="fnref146"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn146">*</A>)</sup>. He continues saying that even if in criminal law
the principle of personal responsibility is justified more, there are some
exceptional cases to the principle considered that there is criminal liability
for third person's act like the case of certain violations of laws by an
organization of work that will result in the conviction of company executives
while the offence was committed by some of their subordinates<sup>147<a
name="fnref147"></a>(<A HREF="#fn147">*</A>)</sup>. </p>
<p Align=justify>Another author called JEAN CLAUDE Soyer suggested that in a
broad sense, the criminal responsibility for third person's act is where a
person is punished for violation committed in its materiality, by someone else.
This applies, for example in case of accomplice by instigation. But in a narrow
sense, normally, criminal liability for other's act refers to criminal
liability of principal (employer) in an enterprise. He/she is attributed to the
offense materially committed by her/his employees, without her/his personal
involvement in the offense<sup>148<a name="fnref148"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn148">*</A>)</sup>.  </p>
<p Align=justify>Both author, M.G.Bri&egrave;re and J.C.Soyer, agree with the
existence of criminal liability for third person's acts despite the general
principles of personality of criminal responsibility and personality of
penalties.  We can wonder if in Rwandan legislations such criminal
responsibility for third person's acts exists. The answer is positive. </p>
<p Align=justify>According to NTAMFURAYINDA Joseph, fines penalties in Rwandan
legislation may not be personal because the Rwandan legislator has provided
some cases the fines are incurred by persons not guilty to the offense. He
suggests with an example of the case of the Penal Code Article 47, which
provides solidarity in regard to the obligation to pay fines and convictions
related to restitutions, damages interest and court fees<strong>. </strong>In
the direction to correct the mistakes that would result from the principle of
solidarity, the Rwandan legislator has set the procedure for bringing an action
for recourse against offenders who have not paid their debts as is stipulated
in the provisions of Article 112 CCL III. Despite all the mitigations taken to
the principle of solidarity, it still contradicts the principle of personality
of sentence enshrined in the supreme law, the constitution<sup><strong>149<a
name="fnref149"></a>(<A HREF="#fn149">*</A>)</strong></sup>.</p>
<p Align=justify>Thus, as said before a suspect can be released during
investigation with guarantee of bond or surety and the latter will cover any
loss resulting from the offence in case the accused escapes the justice. 
Therefore, the execution of final judgment by accused her/himself is eventual
because his/her presence at the time of execution is doubtful. </p>
<p Align=justify>Indeed, the enforcement authorities have only one recourse:
the pursuit of wealth of the offender or that of his surety in case of bail, if
the condemned by his unwillingness or by other circumstances, does not pay
incurred fine<sup>150<a name="fnref150"></a>(<A
HREF="#fn150">*</A>)</sup>.<strong> </strong></p>


<h1 class="core"><A NAME="_Toc60754048"></A><A NAME="_Toc60816871"></A><A
NAME="toc86"></A>GENERAL CONCLUSION</h1>

<p Align=justify>This work entitled:&nbsp; &#171;criminal liability for third
person's acts: case of release on bail&#187; has the hypothesis of personality
principle of responsibility and punishment of fines like other penal sanctions
in case of release on bail. </p>
<p Align=justify>In civil law, there exist cases of liability for others' act.
Unlike, criminal law is framed in terms of imposing punishment for bad
conducts, rather than of grating rewards for good conduct, the emphasis is more
on the prevention of the undesirable than on the encouragement of the
desirable.  Thus, criminal justice system before punishing, considers certain
elements of crime and some circumstances that can mitigate or aggravate
penalties or to imply irresponsibility of perpetrator.                      
However, in principle the penalties are incurred personally by the offender
unless there are causes of non responsibility. </p>
<p Align=justify>Though, the process of charging to some one a offence let
him/her certain rights as long as he/she is presumed innocent. Therefore,
he/she can be provisionally released whether on bail conditions, on bail bond
or on bail surety.  His/her release does not mean that if his/her guilt is
found he/she will not be convicted or execute the sentence.  Indeed, she/he
must execute it unless he/she escaped the justice. However, if he/she escapes,
the enforcement authorities have only one recourse: the pursuit of wealth of
the offender or that of his surety in case of surety bail, for execution of
pecuniary penalties like fines<strong>.</strong></p>
<p Align=justify>It is worth to mention that this research clarifies what
release on bail is under Rwandan law, how the punishment of fines violates
personality principle of criminal liability and punishment not only in case of
release on bail but also in general. The execution of fine punishment is
sometimes against the constitution in its article 17 &#171;<em>criminal
liability is personal</em>&#187;. The release on bail is also against
constitution. There is no equal protection if a suspect is released on payment
of a sum of money. However, release on bail is reserved to the richer and those
who have not financial means shall never benefit provisional release.   </p>


<h1 class="core"><A NAME="toc87"></A>                                                       
   <A NAME="_Toc60754049"></A><A NAME="_Toc60816872"></A>RECOMMANDATIONS </h1>

<p Align=justify>The principle of personality of criminal responsibility
implies the personality of punishment meaning that a person is punishable
because of the offence he/she committed him/herself or he/she participated. 
Criminal justice system should ensure as far as possible if a person to execute
or to serve a punishment is personally offender. </p>
<p Align=justify>The release on bail should be limited only to the bond and
conditions, not to the surety. If release on bail surety is necessary, a surety
should be bound only to civil penalties rather than penal sanctions. The
criminal justice should be careful to the fines penalties. It should recognize
that fines are penal sanctions, then, criminal liability is personal. </p>
<p Align=justify>As a particular recommendation, judges or magistrates in
taking decisions of release on bail, would follow the supreme law, the
constitution, rather than other laws. Their motivations denying bail on surety
would be based on constitutional principle of personality of criminal
liability. If not their decisions will be against the article 17 of Rwandan
constitution. It is good and necessary to know and to respect the hierarchy of
norms.</p>
<p Align=justify>The legislator should correct some articles of code of
criminal procedure especially those relating to release on bail. For example
article 90 which states &#171;<em>bail conditions can be ordered when the
offence a person is charged of is a misdemeanor or a felony</em>&#187; and
article 105 para.2 which states &#171;<em>no bond shall be admitted in respect
of felonies</em>&#187;. The problem is how damages arising from the offence,
property to be restituted and fines will be recovered in case the accused of
felony and released on bail conditions, escapes? Those articles give chance to
that one accused of felony rather than the accused of misdemeanor.</p>
