		<p><em><span style="color: #993300;"><a href="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/multi-sig-01.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3785" src="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/multi-sig-01-300x189.png" alt="multi-sig-01" width="300" height="189" /></a>gAtO ThInK</span></em> &#8211; Multi-Sig will help Bitcoins, but it’s all about the blockchain since it is the one that keeps the Multi-sig Address and the release of the funds by 2 of the 3 signing of the escrow transaction and recording it in the blockchain and it get’s confirmed by the miners like all good Bitcoin transactions so try and give the miners a little fee in any transactions.</p>
<div id="attachment_3780" style="width: 173px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/multisig-transaction-flow-w-tps.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3780" src="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/multisig-transaction-flow-w-tps-163x300.png" alt="Multi-Sig TX" width="163" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Multi-Sig TX</p></div>
<p>BUT it’s kinda complicated and most wallets do not support Multi-Sig. The few that do allow Multi-Sig almost require you to be a programmer of sort to even generate the Multi-Sig Address yet alone spend your money once you have them in the wallet.</p>
<ol>
<li><em><span style="color: #993300;">- First thing is to generate the Multi-sig Wallet address: </span></em></li>
<li><em><span style="color: #993300;">- Register the wallet in the blockchain by sending some money to this address to verify it is working.   </span></em></li>
<li><em><span style="color: #993300;">- To get you money out of a Multi-Sig address you need to: signrawtransaction</span></em></li>
<li><em><span style="color: #993300;">- We have to get 2 of the 3 to sign the transaction and submit it to the blockchain. - Of course 1 ? 2 &#8211; or 3 privateKeys too authorize the transaction. Depending on how you set it up in the first place.   </span></em>
<ul>
<li>RedeemScript</li>
<li>TXid</li>
<li>ScriptPubKey</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Spend you Bitcoins</strong></span></em></li>
</ol>
<p>So let’s try to decode all this horse-play and do some Multi-Sig Wallet Stuff&#8212; BEFORE YOU BEGIN Questions— Pre-Multi-sig Wallet Creation &#8211; How many users must sign to release the coins in this Multi-sig wallet &#8211; 1 ? 2 ? 3 &#8211; make sure you have access to the PrivateKeys of these. You must have access to the PrivateKey of the wallet address you use. Because of the Version of Bitcoin code you can only create a 1 ? 2 or 3 user Multi-Sig wallet- the code will not support a more complex Multi-Sig structure right now, in the future you will be able to create 5 of 7 or 8 of 15 or what ever weird way you want to release your  money from these Multi-Sig Wallets. Todays code only allows 1-2 or 3 signatures to release funds. So once you have this figured out we can begin to generate the NEW Wallet ADDRESS:</p>
<div id="attachment_3781" style="width: 224px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pay2sh.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3781 " src="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pay2sh.jpg" alt="Pay to Script" width="214" height="236" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pay to Script code&#8217;s it all and delivers it to the blockchain</p></div>
<p>PRE-Multi-Sig Address Generation: For our example below I will use 3 different Wallets I generate for this test, these are throw away addresses but you can use them to test it your self.</p>
<ol>
<li>1Pum4jukypYddQDywoQDcgdkz7NMKKHXGR</li>
<li>1L7xm1TrwpsNBCrAaNUw8eBwD115Tr7tpC</li>
<li>145dwy7fvmRJwMpXDVzuZpNSd6UwEbabk2</li>
</ol>
<p>I am assuming that you are running BitcoinD on your server &#8211; if you run Bitcoin-qt you will have access to this command. You can use the “CreateMultiSig” or the “AddMultiSigAddress” commands // they  will generate the Multi-Sig Bitcoin Address, but “CreateMultiSig” is the only one that will give you back the  &#8211; <b>&#8220;redeemScript&#8221;</b> -  and you need this script to get your Bitcoins out of the Multi-Sig address wallet.

<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b><i>Step 1 &#8211; Generate Bitcoin Wallet Address // </i></b></span> It will starts with a number “3”. nRequired you need 1, 2 or 3 signatures to release the funds I have chosen any 2 of the 3 Bitcoin Address listed in the command below can release the coins in the NEW Multi-Sig address—</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>CREATEMULTISIG</b></span></p>
<p><b>COMMAND:</b></p>
<p><b>bitcoind <span style="color: #993300;">createmultisig 2</span></b> &#8216;["<span style="color: #993300;">1Pum4jukypYddQDywoQDcgdkz7NMKKHXGR</span>", "<span style="color: #993300;">1L7xm1TrwpsNBCrAaNUw8eBwD115Tr7tpC</span>", "<span style="color: #993300;">145dwy7fvmRJwMpXDVzuZpNSd6UwEbabk2</span>"]&#8216;</p>
<p><b>OUTPUT:</b> <b>{</b> <b>    &#8220;address&#8221; : &#8220;3DLwoeBuoQRMUDvqvbwQCiYnpauxwC1i71&#8243;,</b> <b>    </b></p>
<p><b>&#8220;<span style="color: #993300;">redeemScript</span>&#8221; : &#8220;5221022934c1f3ddc25426fc057ca706d66d818f63f00f3bb4ad4762947ec23b8c316e210343e871878f6a66728c2a8bec2ae0bffbd4c862968e20280526645f4157de7fca21022a453e7eea23207f87c46881b2e63f56c5ec2e59b30fe887ef29bd21ed67c15d53ae&#8221;</b> <b>}</b></p>
<p>So now you can give this new Multi-Sig address to people &#8211; <span style="color: #993300;"><b>3DLwoeBuoQRMUDvqvbwQCiYnpauxwC1i71</b> - </span> Now you have your NEW Bitcoin Multi-Sig address and people can start to send money to this wallet address. I sent some Bitcoins to this NEW Multi-Sig address from my Wallet . Then I went to my Bitcoin console and typed in:</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>GETRECEIVEBYADDRESS</b></span></p>
<p><b>COMMAND:</b> bitcoind getreceivedbyaddress <b>3DLwoeBuoQRMUDvqvbwQCiYnpauxwC1i71</b></p>
<p><b>OUTPUT:</b> <b>0.00300000</b></p>
<p>Now I know my NEW Multi-Sig Wallet is in working order and registered in the blockchain remember if it not registered in the blockchain then it nothing NADA-one zip. Rules of the Muliti-Signature Wallet</p>
<ul>
<li>All MultiSig address start with the number “3” a regular Bitcoin address start with the number “1”.</li>
<li>You can only have a 1-2 or 3 part Multi-Sig wallet. We cannot do a 5 or 7 part Multi-sig transaction today do to the core Bitcoin CODE.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>So now I have a NEW Bitcoin Address —<b>3DLwoeBuoQRMUDvqvbwQCiYnpauxwC1i71</b>  —  and now people can send Bitcoins to that address as much as they want and it acts just like a normal Bitcoin Wallet.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b><i>Step 2 &#8211; GET MONEY OUT of a Multi-Sig address Wallet —</i></b></span> So now i can look at my Multi-sig wallet and check to see if I have any money in my account</p>

<p>As you can see by the output and remember this is all in the blockchain  <a href="https://blockchain.info/tx/c45c8c00243c703412e207646d51bf6878444537c37372528012f412f552b9cd">https://blockchain.info/tx/c45c8c00243c703412e207646d51bf6878444537c37372528012f412f552b9cd</a></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">SINGRAWTRANSACTION</span> Now we need to sign the release of funds from this address with the</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>signrawtransaction COMMAND</b></span> this is the syntax but if you look carefully you will see <b>“<span style="color: #993300;">txid</span>”</b> <b>“<span style="color: #993300;">scriptPubKey</span>”,</b> <b>“<span style="color: #993300;">redeemScript</span>”</b> and if you look above <b>OUTPUT: </b>with my LISTUNSPENT command you will see this information.</p>
<p>Now you just need the PrivateKey to sign the transaction. signrawtransaction &lt;hex string&gt; [{"<b>txid</b>":<span style="color: #993300;"><b>txid</b></span>,"vout":n,"<span style="color: #993300;"><b>scriptPubKey</b></span>":hex,"<span style="color: #993300;"><b>redeemScript</b></span>":hex},...] [&lt;privatekey1&gt;,...] [sighashtype="ALL"]</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign inputs for raw transaction (serialized, hex-encoded).</li>
<li>Second optional argument (may be null) is an array of previous transaction outputs that this transaction depends on but may not yet be in the block chain.</li>
<li>Third optional argument (may be null) is an array of base58-encoded private keys that, if given, will be the only keys used to sign the transaction.</li>
<li>Fourth optional argument is a string that is one of six values; ALL, NONE, SINGLE or ALL|ANYONECANPAY, NONE|ANYONECANPAY, SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY.</li>
<li>Returns json object with keys:
<ul>
<li>hex : raw transaction with signature(s) (hex-encoded string)</li>
<li>complete : 1 if transaction has a complete set of signature (0 if not)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">SENDRAWTRANSACTION </span> Once all signed the TX it will produce a HEX string &#8211; we take that info and add it to</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">SENDRAWTRANSACTION</span> and I will finally get my Bitcoins and spend them from my Multi-sig wallet. You can keep putting money into this wallet and just have them signed and you can keep getting money out forever- this is just another  Bitcoin wallet address with a few gatekeepers, it harder but more secure in the long run. hope this helps a little &#8211; In my new BIP32 wallet I have all this out in a nice GUI to Keep it simple but still have the power of an escrow Multi-sig Wallet- <em><span style="color: #993300;">gAtO OuT</span></em></p>

		<p><b>Bitcoin 2.0 and the Segway Bike</b></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #993300;">gAtO Imagine</span></em> - some of the business side applications we can build with future triggered events being executed by Autonomous Cyber Robots. All build on the basic Bitcoin 1.0 code but <b>not using the coins</b> but the <b>blockchain</b> &#8211; there be treasure in that blockchain but it’s all math ugh!!!.</p>
<p><a href="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/segway_bike_Bitcoin.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3774" alt="segway_bike_Bitcoin" src="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/segway_bike_Bitcoin-300x200.png" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>Ok first what is Bitcoin 2.0? Basically it’s a new way to have a cyber robot or a cyber drone that can do what you instruct them to do. It is a <b>timestamp triggered event</b> and you can <b>now just add business rules</b> to it that will work in cyberspace.</p>
<p>What do you do online today?</p>
<ul>
<li>Shop for things and have them delivered</li>
<li>Online banking</li>
<li>Buy and sell stocks and bonds</li>
<li>Send donations to Charities or political organizations</li>
</ul>
<p>So now you can build <b>cyber-business rules</b> to be execute on the web and put them into one of these cyber robot or a cyber drone. I use these 2 terms because when people hear drones they think attacks and such and yes you can now build digital FINANCIAL  warriors that can execute based on events, millions of them and they can be used for good and evil.</p>
<p>timeStamp- or -blockchain-trigger event &#8211; robots with business rules- example//</p>
<ul>
<li>Send 100 Bitcoins to my family every 6 months after I die.</li>
<li>Buy or sell stocks ambiguously  &#8211; Digital Business Contracts &#8211; or Personalities</li>
<li>Any transaction that can be performed on the web!</li>
<li>Set up a corporation by an Ethereum digital actors</li>
<li><i>Any Business rule that can executed digitally</i><b> </b></li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="color: #993300;">gAtO lOvE Ethereum</span></em> //= it is a platform and a programming language that makes it possible for any developer to build and publish next-generation distributed applications. <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">https://www.ethereum.org/</a>  Next Generation Smart Contracts and a Decentralize Application Platform. Non-geek <b>cyber-business rules OK&#8230;</b></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #993300;"><em>GAtO used to lug around an Osborne luggable computer… 1.0 laptops &#8211; but gAtO was cool aligning 10MB (yes 10 Mega Bytes) hard rives the size of a large home freezer. The good old computers days… Out of hardware back to Biz -mEoW</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>MasterCoin</b> &#8211; The Master Protocol facilitates the creation and trading of smart properties and user currencies as well as other types of smart contracts. Mastercoins serve as the binding between bitcoins (BTC), smart properties and smart contracts created on top of the Mastercoin Protocol. Non-geek <b>cyber-business rules OK&#8230;</b></p>
<p>Similar Alt-coins but both the same (going after the business side) in a way but these seem to be a new wave of Bitcoin 1.0 off shoots. Now NameCoin and Trusted coin are on a different course, since they are more into the digital Notary service that can be done with any blockchain type Bitcoin off shoot. And LiteCoin 84 Million -versus- 21 Million in Bitcoins another fight but of a different financial play on this alt-coin. LiteCoin is around $10 bucks Per so we have to keep an I on them too.</p>
<p>Once again these another development are being built on the shoulder of the great Satoshi Nakamoto work. GaTo as a technologist love all these new and exciting toys to play with. Then I think about the Segway Bike I alway wanted one but then again really, I’m I really ready to give up walking? Back in 2001 it was so cool, it was the evolution of the bicycle or was it???</p>
<p>13 years later this evolution the revolution of the bicycle is seem by most as the Mall Police ride by. Ok maybe in Seattle or San Francisco I can see that but really. Now Bicycle Cops are everywhere but real cops on a Serway Bike &#8211; you know maybe I don’t really want one anymore. But I wonder if I can buy one with Bitcoins? ummm</p>
<p>DogE-Coin is hot with the young bloods as a NEW digital currency that’s taking Reddit and other places by storm- I know <b>gAtOCoin</b>, <i>maybe</i> I’ll start one of my own, there only about 500 Alt-Coins around and growing all built on the Bitcoin core code. Bitcoin is only 5 Years Old -Wow- Imagine in another 3-5 years // world wide currencies all over doing different things creating the NEW Cyber-System D-(system) that no government can controls, of the people and by the people. Double -Wow</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #993300;">gAtO’s</span></em> bet is on Bitcoin, simple it has payed it’s dues, from an underground play toy to International financial deals like flying to the Moon on Virgin Air, I wonder if I can buy that with Litecoins- you listening Richard Branson I’m mining Namecoin too Richard.</p>
<p>The new Bitcoin business Investors and Incubators are hopping with new Bitcoin 2.0 ideas, but is it different if it’s control by the users, not the sole players like the bankers and older financial players. But truth be told these will bring newer workable solutions that will trickle down to the normal person. We must be careful because these new worldwide cyber solution will have little government controls so the game is changing and the ability to jump on this but NOT to give up privacy with government toys like TPM &#8211; Trusted Computer Platform &#8211; yes July 2015 all Windows 8 devices will have TPM 2.0 in control of your devices. The US solution cyber Kill Switch.</p>
<p>AT least Apple has not added TPM into it’s hardware but they banned against Bitcoin -Steve told you to Innovate Apple- But that’s another battle.</p>
<p>You can trust your government spying on you IF you have nothing to hide RIGHT!!! <em><span style="color: #993300;">- gAtO oUt</span></em></p>
<p><b>Digital System D</b>-</p>
<p>System D is a slang phrase pirated from French-speaking Africa and the Caribbean. The French have a word that they often use to describe particularly effective and motivated people. They call them<i> débrouillards</i>. To say a man is a <i>débrouillard </i>is to tell people how resourceful and ingenious he is. The former French colonies have sculpted this word to their own social and economic reality. They say that inventive, self-starting, entrepreneurial merchants who are doing business on their own, without registering or being regulated by the bureaucracy and, for the most part, without paying taxes, are part of “<i>l’economie de la débrouillardise</i>.” Or, sweetened for street use, “<i>Systeme D</i>.” This essentially translates as the ingenuity economy, the economy of improvisation and self-reliance, the do-it-yourself, or DIY, economy.</p>

<p><span style="color: #993300;">What is Digital Currency: &#8211; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em>gAtO cOnFuSeD -</em></span> with the above definition currency and fiat currency it’s a bit confusing were does Digital currency fit in. I think it’s how you look at it &#8211; Today we have Internet banks &#8211; that would be digital currency because it’s only in digital form &#8211; We also have PayPal one of the leaders in digital currency but both are tied to <em>fiat currency</em>- a government. <a href="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/aa_bitcoin_big.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-2615" title="aa_bitcoin_big" src="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/aa_bitcoin_big-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>Now when you add E-gold, Liberty Reserves, Pencunix or WebMoney these are a mix of traditional fiat and plain old fashion currency &#8211; But when you add BitCoin well that throws a shoe into the jet engine. You see unlike e-gold Bitcoin is not tied to real gold. Bitcoin is defined as a c<strong>urrency</strong> but not <strong>fiat</strong> and that’s the part that really hurts governments and bankers.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em>I know gAtO is lOcO</em></span> but it seems that every time a digital currency like e-gold get’s close even when they try to do it right &#8211; the good guy’s (governments) come in and stomp on it till it’s a puddle of mud in the ground, next digital currency come on in&#8211; get in line, next… Ok e-gold made it too easy to get an account and the bad guy’s got hip to it and ruined it for everyone but the FBI was out to get e-gold from the start. We just can’t have joe-blow in a basement with a e-gold account and the IRS, TAX people not wanting a piece of that action.</p>
<p><a title="BitCoin 101" href="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/2012/07/24/bitcoin-101/" target="_blank">Bitcoins</a> are being blamed as EVIL &#8211; but Swiss Banks account, Bermuda Shell Games, Luxemboug Shelter, The Cayman Cash or IRA tax-free, tax-exempt, lower Tax rates- tax-free trust &#8211; there are all kinds of tricks for the bankers to shelter their money. To hide it they know all the tax codes, all the regulations…and they are very happy.</p>
<p>If we go to Bitcoin or a version of a digital currency that has <span style="color: #993300;"><em>no -governments, no bankers</em></span>, and <em><span style="color: #993300;">no printing press</span></em> to go Bitcoin printing making Happy—/ every ounce of pressure will be put on every new digital currencies that do not tie to the BANKS…. they will not allow it.. Who are THEY…you know??? -next Digital Money Laundry <em><span style="color: #993300;">-gAtO oUt</span></em></p>

On the other side of the coin..//</p>
<p>On Oct. 6 Susanne Posel <a href="http://occupycorporatism.com/the-connection-between-white-house-cyber-attacks-and-global-reserve-currency/" target="_blank">reported</a> -/ an attempt to hack into the U.S.A executive branch’s computer system through an unclassified network.  That’s the White House kitties with a simple “Spear Phishing” attack. They trolled for names of Top Military and government officials in Google’s Gmail account and got a few hit. Once again “Open Source Intelligence”  <a href="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/math_clouadTag.tiff"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2882" title="math_clouadTag" src="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/math_clouadTag.tiff" alt="" width="387" height="260" /></a></p>
<p>- everything goes somewhere and gAtO (as well as others) goes everywhere.</p>
<p>A few days later the Iranians government blocked Gmail by government officials due to fears that Email can be a point of infection for attacks- I think that’s in the security 101 course</p>
<p>Bruce Schneier<strong> one of our cyber gods</strong> that knows what he is talking about say’s it best about chicken little screaming “the cyber Sky is falling” &#8211; <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/10/stoking_cyber_f.html" target="_blank">STROKING CYBER FEARS</a> &#8211; “Secretary Panetta&#8217;s recent comments are just the latest; search the Internet for &#8220;cyber 9/11,&#8221; &#8220;cyber Pearl-Harbor,&#8221; &#8220;cyber Katrina,&#8221; or &#8212; my favorite &#8212; &#8220;cyber Armageddon.” But Bruce says it best in his own words  “There&#8217;s an enormous amount of money and power that results from pushing cyberwar and cyberterrorism: power within the military, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Justice Department; and lucrative government contracts supporting those organizations. As long as cyber remains a prefix that scares, it&#8217;ll continue to be used as a bugaboo.”  -may I add-/ to make lots of MONEY in private-corporation and government contracts worldwide. Fear + Cyber Security = BIG $$$</p>
<p>Fear is what bankers see as Africa is the first country that is being targeted for the BitCoin virtual currency. Imagine the turmoil in Nigeria and other places in Africa it has had a history of unstable governments the idea of a digital currency is appealing… La-Times read -<a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/04/bitcoin-virtual-money-africa-rudiger-koch.html" target="_blank">Africa &#8212; the next frontier for virtual currency?</a></p>
<p>BUT the <strong>Bitcoin is NOT ready People</strong> &#8211; <strong><span style="color: #993300;">[1]</span> </strong>Satoshi warned us &#8211; it’s BETA software &#8211; It has only 21 Million bit coins and the last Bitcoin will be mined in 2040 &#8211; Governments and corporations have already started the propaganda that Bitcoin’s are EVIL. — <a href="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/aa_bitCoin_001.tiff"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2575" title="aa_bitCoin_001" src="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/aa_bitCoin_001.tiff" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The most important thing is, we must all be active in out lives to make the new future- They fear us “the people” will wake up and take control of our lives” &#8211; the new generation was born with a cell device in their hand and they are using it earlier and earlier to communicate.</p>
<p>The Cyber war that we see is not as bad as the Cyber War that is being fought with fear and propaganda because the bankers will lose control with &#8211; One World Currency &#8211; One World Government &#8211; that is what the hacktivist want, the new kids, the new generation.</p>
<p>Cyberspace is the city of Babel and in this mystical city everyone was able to communicate to anyone and exchange idea, dreams and culture—/ but this cause the priest to lose control so they destroyed it and made it EVIL. It’s only Evil when you lose your power, It is EVIL when you give them control and power — it’s our turn now <em><span style="color: #993300;">-gAtO oUt</span></em></p>

<p>This Book covers the main aspects of the fabulous and dangerous world of -“The Deep Dark Web” . We are just two cyber specialists Pierluigi Paganini &amp; Richard -gAtO- Amores, with one passion and two souls we wanted to explain the inner working of the deep dark web. We have had a long collaboration in this efforts to document our findings we made infiltrations into the dark places inaccessible to many to give a you the reader a clear vision on the major mystery of the dark hidden web that exist today in the Tor Onion network..</p>
<p>The Web, the Internet, mobile cell devices and social networking has become commonly used words that identify technological components of daily Internet user’s experience in the cyberspace. But how much do we really know about cyberspace? Very, very little, Google / Yahoo / Bing only show us 20% of the Internet the other 80% is hidden to the average user unless you know were to look.</p>
<p>The other 80% of the Internet is what this book is about the “Deep Dark Web”, three words with millions of interpretations, mysterious place on the web, the representation of the hell in the cyberspace but also the last opportunity to preserve freedom of expression from censorship. Authorities and corporation try to discourage the use of this untapped space because they don’t control it. We the people of the free world control this network of Tor -Onion Routers by volunteer around the world.</p>
<p>The Deep Dark Web seems to be full of crooks and cyber criminals, it is the hacker’s paradise, where there are no rule, no law, no identity in what is considered the reign of anonymity, but this is also the reason why many persecuted find refuge and have the opportunity to shout to the world their inconvenient truths.</p>
<p>The Deep Dark Web is a crowded space with no references but in reality it is a mine of information unimaginable, a labyrinth of knowledge in the book we will try to take you by the hand to avoid the traps and pitfalls hopefully illuminating your path in the dark.</p>
<p>Cybercrime, hacktivism, intelligence, cyber warfare are all pieces of this complex puzzle in which we will try to make order, don’t forget that the Deep Dark Web has unbelievable opportunity for business and governments, it represents the largest on-line market where it is possible to sell and acquire everything, and dear reader where there is $money$  you will find also banking, financial speculators and many other sharks.</p>
<p>Do you believe that making  money in Deep Web is just a criminal prerogative? Wrong, the authors show you how things works in the hidden economy and which are the future perspectives of is digital currency, the Bitcoin.</p>
<p>This manuscript proposes both faces of the subject, it illustrates the risks but also legitimate use of anonymizing networks such as TOR adopted by journalist to send file reports before governments agents censored his work .</p>
<p>Here are some question we may answers to:</p>
<p><em>How many person know about the cyber criminals and their ecosystem in the deep web? </em></p>
<p><em>How many have provided information on the financial systems behind the “dirty affairs”? </em></p>
<p><em>How the law enforcement and governments use Dark Web?</em></p>
<p>Let’s hold your breath and start the trip in the abyss of knowledge to find answers to the above questions. We hope that with this book you can learn something new about &#8211; The Deep Dark Web.</p>

		<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em>gAtO</em></span> been doing some research in botnets and found out some cool things. The basics IRC- http &#8211; p2p and twitter botnets architecture and bots are becoming easier to find and use, tutorials and videos are all over the place and in any language. So the task of becoming a bot-master is easy.  Bot&#8217;s can be used for good also but nobody want&#8217;s to hear about that&#8230;Imagine bot&#8217;s being used with Amber alerts to or other emergencies tools were thousands of computers are needed, bot&#8217;s can be used for good things too.</p>
<p><a href="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bot_list.tiff"><img class=" wp-image-2788 alignleft" title="bot_list" src="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bot_list.tiff" alt="" width="383" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>Botnets are a big problem they allow anyone to have thousand, millions  of computers at their beck and call, a kid in a basement, or an enemy of the state these bot’s are a real danger. These bot’s have 4 different attack vector:<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Kenetic &#8211; Distribution &#8211; Information &#8211; cyberTools </strong></p>
<p><strong>kinetic</strong> -zombie computer are used to Ddos attack a site or Click-fraud advertisement scams.</p>
<p><strong>distributors</strong> &#8211; sending spam email- (Adware/ Spyware) &#8211; infecting other computers &#8211; co-workers, friends and families</p>
<p><strong>information</strong> Keylogger, data exfiltration, key stealing from games -for sale $$ &#8211; email, social network — friends — banking &#8211; payPal &#8211; Work -Corporate spying and IP (intellectual property) plus emails of co-workers, friends and family.</p>
<p><strong>cyberTools</strong> &#8211; we see bot’s become DNS servers, c&amp;c servers, infection distribution servers, proxies, Tor (exit/entry) nodes or just a ftp site for storage.</p>
<p>I have seen lot’s of different bot’s but only four (4) basic types of botnet Command and Control (C&amp;C) architecture: IRC (Internet Relay Chat) based, HTTP (or Web) based and P2P (Peer-to-peer) based &#8211; and Now Twitter controlled botnet&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Todays bot’s can be used in Intelligence Gathering, Monitoring and surveillance with the ability to turn on WebCam and Microphone without the victim knowing and recording it makes them even more dangerous and any digital cell device is hackable.</p>
<p><a href="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bot_code.tiff"><img class=" wp-image-2792 alignright" title="bot_code" src="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bot_code.tiff" alt="" width="233" height="306" /></a></p>
<p>Here is a new one for me a private <strong>Twitter accoun</strong>t is being used <strong>as the (C&amp;C)</strong> command and control for bots. Once the bots are installed in the machine they go out and friend their botMaster they accept the friend and now send coded messages that are the commands for the bot’s. This is pretty cool and since it’s Twitter is kinda normal communication tool even in business machines, groups use twitter all the time to communicate.</p>
<p>In my research I found bots and video, tutorials and everything I need. On top of that we have Tor and other anonymized (custom Tor network) for these bot’s to communicate untraceable and cannot be found.</p>
<p>Here is were the metal hit’s the road because in this environment the p2p Botnet Architecture used with Tor would be an unstoppable solution and it’s becoming reality today: I included a thread from a hacker site in Tor discussing this very subject //.</p>
<p>these are some of the bot’s I found free source code to play -</p>
<p>G-Bot 1.7 Ddos-Bot &#8211; Zues 2.0.8.9 &#8211; ClientMesh 4.0 &#8211; DarkComet 5.3.1 &#8211; BlackShades 4.8 &#8211; SpyEye 1.3.45</p>
<p>Below are some of <span style="color: #993300;">my notes</span> on this I hope they may help <span style="color: #993300;"><em>- gAtO oUt </em></span></p>
<p>botnet basics</p>
<p>There are basically 3 types of Bot net technologies. The first botnets started back about a decade ago with IRC bots</p>
<p><a href="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bot_irc_01.tiff"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2790" title="bot_irc_01" src="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bot_irc_01.tiff" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>it’s more a continual connection at all times</p>
<p>IRC &#8211; HTTP &#8211; P2P &#8211; note p2p is the best meshed no central C&amp;C</p>
<p><a href="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bot_p2p_02.tiff"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2789" title="bot_p2p_02" src="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bot_p2p_02.tiff" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>With HTTP botnets you can communicate async &#8211; things can be schedule a meeting and then log of and do the work then at a pre arrange time you call home (C&amp;C) and check in with mamma.</p>
<p><a href="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bot_http.tiff"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2791" title="bot_http" src="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bot_http.tiff" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Then you have p2p botnet’s they have no central C&amp;C so are much harder to find the source and kill it.</p>
<p>Here we see were some of the bot’s may become proxies or some units may be used to cascade out spam interactions, one may also become a download location, one a dns server. The key thing to take away from a Peer to Peer networks is it’s very difficult to take them down because of their mesh network. There is no central point of failure, it’’s a simple file sharing protocol</p>

<p>Hey guys, just thought I would leave a thread here to announce a new bot that I am working on at the moment, Kronos.</p>
<p>Kronos is an http bot that runs through tor, each bot will launch its own tor process and then connect to your panel (which is a hidden service) using tor.</p>
<p><strong>Current Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The bot will act as a hidden service on the tor network</li>
<li>Socks5 proxy. Because of the above feature you are able to connect to the bot and use it as a proxy through tor, this removes the need for the bot to use upnp to open a port for you to connect through as tor handles NAT traversal by having the server connect out to the network itself, meaning there are no incoming connections. You can read here for more if you don&#8217;t already know how this works https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en</li>
<li>Torrent seeder, not a shitty seeder that adds torrent files to the users torrent client, bots will work as real torrent clients.</li>
<li>Various flooding abilities (useless in my opinion)</li>
<li>Form grabber</li>
<li>Possibly mailing capabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>I am also playing with some p2p code</p>

<p>// So now that we know a bit about botnets let’s look at how they can make a profit for the criminal, below I listed of some of the stuff that you can harvest from your botnet empire.</p>
<p>Revenue Generated</p>
<p>Spam</p>
<p>Adware/ Spyware Scare-ware</p>
<p>Crimeware &#8211; Keylogger, data exfiltration, key stealing from games -for sale $$ &#8211; email, social network — friends — banking &#8211; payPal &#8211; Work -Corporate spying and IP plus emails of friends and work buddies..</p>
<p>Clickfraud</p>

		<p><em><span style="color: #993300;">gAtO hAs -</span></em> found that e-commerce in the Black Market in the Tor-onion network is a little different than e-commerce in the clear web. Places like the Silk Road that deal with illegal drugs and other black market marketplaces have a lot to think about when they do business and the customers of these services have similar problems that can open them up to being caught and prosecuted. There a few thing that we must examine to understand e-commerce in the deep dark web. Once again <span style="color: #993300;"><em>gAtO does not recommend doing business with the black market</em></span> but from a technical and SE view of how these transactions happened we may learn something. I have learned that China,Iran and Syria look for Tor traffic because of the fingerprint of the traffic stream &#8211; Tor traffic is padded to 512 byte size packets, normal VPN is not. But we know that the Tor-Project team is working on new and better ways to hide Tor fingerprint so everything is evoling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">Here are a few notes I found that makes you think &#8211; mAyBe sI-nO:</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conceal your membership (VERY IMPORTANT FOR VENDORS)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Using Tor by itself is not enough to protect you, particularly if you are a vendor.</strong> <a href="http://g7pz322wcy6jnn4r.onion/opensource/polyfront/internetoverlayanalysis.html">Membership revealment attacks</a> combined with rough geolocation intelligence can lead to a compromise! The gist of a membership revealment attack is easy to understand. The attacker merely determines everyone who is connecting to a particular network, even if they are incapable of determining where the traffic being sent through the network is destined for. Tor does a good job of preventing an attacker who can see exit traffic from following the stream back to your location. Unfortunately, if you ship product the attacker can determine your rough geolocation merely by determining where you ship product from. If the attacker already knows your rough geolocation and they are capable of doing a membership revealment attack to determine who all in your area is connected to Tor, they can likely narrow down your possible identity to a very small set size, possibly even a set size of one.</p>
<p>This is not likely to be useful for evidence but it will provide strong intelligence. Intelligence is the first step to gathering evidence. The attacker may put everyone in your area who they detect are connecting to the Tor network under meatspace surveillance looking for evidence of drug trafficking activity. For this reason it is highly important that you protect yourself from membership revealment attacks!</p>
<p>Membership revealment attacks are less a worry for customers (provided financiall intelligence is properly countered to avoid an attacker finding rough customer geolocations!) than they are for vendors. There are a few reasons why this is true. First of all a customer is likely to reveal more about their identity when they place an order than the attacker will be able to determine with a geolocation + membership revealment attack. Secondly, the vendors allowed to operate on Open Source have been highly screened to significantly reduce the probability that any of them are federal agents, but the customers on Open Source are not only anonymous but they are also not screened at all. Third of all, the <a href="http://g7pz322wcy6jnn4r.onion/opensource/polyfront/netwar.html">organizational structure</a> reduces the risk for customers; a customer may work with a few vendors but each vendor is likely to be working with hundreds or thousands of customers. Customers sourcing from Open Source are at minimal risk even if they have products delivered directly to there own residence, vendors working on Open Source at particularly vulnerable to membership revealment attacks due to the open nature of the site.</p>
<p>The primary concern for customers is that they <a href="http://g7pz322wcy6jnn4r.onion/opensource/polyfront/finnetworks.html">load finances anonymously and the vendor decentralizes their financial network</a>. If a vendor is using a <a href="http://g7pz322wcy6jnn4r.onion/opensource/polyfront/netwar.html">star network</a> (centralized) financial topology there is a risk that an attacker could map out the geographic locations where customers loaded funds. After determining where funding was loaded the attackers could do anonymizer membership revealment attacks in an area around the load point and filter out everyone who is not using an anonymizer. This will likely leave the customer and few others. The attacker may even be able to compare CCTV footage of the load to the users of anonymizers in the area and look for a facial recognition match. To counter this it is important for customers to make use of good financial counter intelligence techniques (E-currency layering being one). Customers may also choose to utilize transients by paying them a fee to load currency, this way the customer avoids being on CCTV at any point. If vendors decentralize funding points (ditch the star network topology) customers will be strongly protected from such attacks, however it is impossible for a customer to ensure that a vendor is using a 1:1 customer to account/pseudonym identification ratio.</p>
<p>There are several ways you can protect yourself from a membership revealment attack, if you are a vendor it would be foolish to not take one of these countermeasures. The primary way to protect from a membership revealment attack is to make sure you do not enter traffic through the same network you exit traffic through. As all traffic to Open Source &#8216;exits&#8217; through the Tor network, entering your traffic through a VPN first will reduce your vulnerability to membership revealment attacks. The attacker will have to determine who all in your area uses any anonymizing technology and put all of them under meatspace surveillance, there are likely to be far more people in your area using some sort of proxy system than there are people using Tor in particular. This will substantially increase the cost of putting all &#8216;potential targets&#8217; under surveillance.</p>
<p>Using a VPN is helpful but it is not the most ideal solution. Your crowd space against a membership revealment attack will increase but perhaps not by much depending on the particular area you work out of. <strong>Also, a particularly skilled attacker may be able to determine you are using a VPN to connect to Tor by fingerprinting traffic streams. Tor traffic is padded to 512 byte size packets, normal VPN traffic is not. By filtering for 512 byte streams, an attacker can determine who all is using Tor in a given area.</strong> VPN&#8217;s protect from IP routing based membership revealment attacks but not from traffic fingerprinting membership revealment attacks. However, it is less likely that an attacker will be able to do a traffic fingerprinting membership revealment attack. <strong>The Chinese intelligence services apparently are still using IP address based attacks to block access to the Tor network.</strong> This is not nearly as effective as traffic fingerprinting based attacks. This could be an indication that traffic fingerprinting membership revealment attacks are more difficult to carry out (likely), however it could also be due to a lack of skill on the part of Chinas intelligence services. It could also be that China is not particularly interested in blocking/detecting all Tor traffic and IP address based attacks meet their requirements.</p>
<p>A better option than using a VPN would be to set up a private VPS and then enter all of your Tor traffic through this. Doing this will make you much more resistant to IP address based membership revealment attacks because now the attacker will not even be able to narrow you down to all people in your area using any anonymity technology. This is still weak to traffic fingerprinting membership revealment attacks!</p>
<p>Perhaps the best option to avoid membership revealment attacks is to use open or cracked WiFi from a different location + Tor every single time you connect. You could even use open Wifi + VPN/VPS + Tor for very high security from membership revealment attacks. Using <em>random</em> (not your neighbors) open/cracked WiFi greatly increaces your resistance to a wide variety of identity revealing attacks. An attacker can still do membership revealment attacks on users of open WiFi but they can no longer gain useful intelligence from the attack. If they detect that an open WiFi connection unrelated to you is using Tor it can not be used to put you under meatspace surveillance unless they manage to identify you (facial recognition from CCTV cameras, etc).</p>
<p>If you are operating as part of a group you can avoid membership revealment attacks via smart organizational policy. The person responsible for communicating with customers should be different from the person shipping orders. Now the customers are incapable of determining where your actual rough geolocation is because product is sent from a different geographic area than you communicate from. Your shipper should be aware that they will potentially come under scrutiny via a geolocation + membership revealment attack, <em>especially if they use Tor to enter traffic</em>.</p>
<p>Another option is to configure Tor to use a bridge. Tor bridges are designed to allow people in nations such as China the ability to connect to the Tor network. China uses IP address based blocking to prevent users from connecting to known Tor nodes. Bridges are Tor entry guards that are not publicly listed and have a limited distribution mechanism. You can get some Tor bridge IP addresses from the Tor website. We do not suggest you use Tor bridges because they replace your entry guard and they are under crowded. This will lead to a <strong>lot</strong> less multiplexing on your Tor circuit and can hurt your anonymity in other ways, although it will indeed offer some level of protection from membership revealment attacks. China has managed to detect about 80% of Tor bridges, it is likely that NSA knows all of them. Police agencies in the West are probably not yet particularly worried about locating bridge nodes but they can probably do so with near the same accuracy as China. In our opinion it is not smart to rely on a Tor bridge to protect you from membership revealment attacks in most cases.</p>
<p><strong>Step Four: Know how to do safe product transfer, handle finances safe</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although customers sourcing from Open Source are encouraged to take the best security measures they can, it is not likely required for them to utilize advanced operational security regarding mail (such as fake ID boxes, tactical pick utechniques, etc). Because the vendors allowed to be listed here have been highly screened it is likely safe for customers to have product delivered directly to their homes. If you only work with highly trusted and trusted vendors your biggest concern will be a package being intercepted!</p>

<p><strong>Online Verification Procedures</strong><br />
Over the years, I&#8217;ve come across dozens of procedure lists for top-tier merchants regarding online transations and fraud reduction. I&#8217;ll detail several companies verification procedures below.</p>
<p>While most virtual carders are aware of the various procedures in place to verify orders placed online, few actually understand the implementation of fraud scoring, and the order in which these verification methods are used.<br />
The Risk Management Toolkit</p>
<ul>
<li>AVS</li>
<li>CVV</li>
<li>IP/GEO/BIN</li>
<li>Cardholder Authentication (VbV/MSC)</li>
<li>Phone Verifications</li>
<li>Manual Order Reviews</li>
<li>Chargebacks &amp; Representments</li>
<li>PCI Compliance &amp; Data Security</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AVS &#8211; Address Verification Service</strong></p>
<p>How It Works</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides a Match or Non-Match Result for only the Billing Street # and Billing Zip Code… not the actual address. (i.e. “1234 Test Street” is parsed into “1234” just the same as “1234 Wrong Way” would be).</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation</p>
<ul>
<li>Available on any Internet merchant account and virtually any Payment Gateway.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Most gateways provide an AVS configuration area where you can specify whether you want to automatically“decline” (i.e. do not settle) an authorization that has an AVS mis-match or non-match.</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to implement Limitations</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Works only for U.S., CND, U.K. cardholders so this does not help you scrub most international transactions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A growing % of compromised credit cards – especially those obtained through inside jobs or hacked databases– will also contain the necessary information to provide a valid AVS match result.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendation</p>
<ul>
<li>If you handle a mix of int’l and U.S. sales, you will want consider scrubbing with AVS on the U.S. transactions but do NOT scrub via AVS for any international transactions as they will always fail. AVS should not beconsidered a primary means of verifying the validity of a transaction. Nearly 20% of the fraud can potentially be eliminated by scrubbing “Non-Matched” AVS match results.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CVV – Card Verification Value</strong></p>
<p>How It Works</p>
<ul>
<li>A service with many names – CVV2, CVC2, CID – but the premise is the same for all.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Provides a Match or Non-Match Result for the 3-digit or 4-digit number embossed on the back of the cardholder’s card. The CVV is NOT generally encoded on the magnetic stripe and therefore is less likely to be captured as part of a card skimming tactic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation</p>
<ul>
<li>Available on any Internet merchant account and virtually any Payment Gateway.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Most gateways provide an CVV configuration area where you can specify whether you want to automatically “decline” (i.e. do notsettle) an authorization that has an CVV non-match or non-entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>Works for virtually ALL cardholder accounts – both U.S. and international.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is no valid reason why a legitimate cardholder, in possession of the card, would not be able to enter a 100% matching numberfor this.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Merchants are not allowed to store CVV and as such the CVV # is less vulnerable than the data used for AVS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations</p>
<ul>
<li>CVV data can only be used for a real-time transaction. CVV data can not be stored and therefore can not be utilized for Recurring Transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendation</p>
<ul>
<li>CVV is a recommended service to utilize for ALL initial transactions processed. Based on our internal charge-back analysis, merchants can reduce their fraud ratesby as much as 70% by simply requiring a matching CVV result.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IP/GEO/BIN Scrubbing</strong></p>
<p>How It Works</p>
<ul>
<li>Compares the IP address of the customer purchasing with their stated geographic location (i.e. why is the customer from California ordering from Europe?)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Compares the BIN # (first 6 digits) of the credit card with the IP or stated geographic location of the customer (i.e. the customer isusing an US-issued credit card but they are from Europe?)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Based on the IP and BIN # and other customer-inputted data, a vast amount of information can be returned on the transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom direct integration into a service such as MaxMind.com</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Use an existing integration that is part of a Shopping Cart such as X-Cart, LiteCommerce, osCommerce, ZenCart,ASPDotNetStorefront.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Use an existing integration that is part of a Billing System such as WHMCompleteSolution, ClientExec or Ubersmith.</li>
</ul>
<p>•Use an existing integration that is part of a Payment Gateway such as the Quantum Payment Gateway.</p>
<p>Benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast, Cost Effective and Non-Intrusive</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Provides merchants with an excellent “do the pieces fit consistently?” analysis.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Can block up to 89% of all fraud if properly implemented</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally not reliable for AOL users due to the way that AOL routes its traffic (AOL users require a merchant-specific approach)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Proxy database is always in a real-time process of being updated as new proxies open up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendation</p>
<ul>
<li>IP/GEO/BIN fraud scores should be used in the order evaluation process more as a means of flagging transactions as “high risk” formore intensive scrubbing vs. being an outright decline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of what IP Geo-Location can tell you:</p>
<p>YELLOW ALERTS</p>
<ul>
<li>Free E-mail Address: is the user ordering from a free e-mail address?</li>
<li>Customer Phone #: does the customer phone # match the user’s billing location? (Only for U.S.)</li>
<li>BIN Country Match: does the BIN # from the card match the country the user states they are in?</li>
<li>BIN Issuing Bank Name: does the user’s inputted name for the bank match the database for that BIN?</li>
<li>BIN Phone Match: does the customer service phone # given by the user match the database for that BIN?</li>
</ul>
<p>RED ALERTS</p>
<ul>
<li>Country Match: does the country that the user is ordering from match where they state they are ordering from?</li>
<li>High Risk Country: is the user ordering from one of the designated high risk countries?</li>
<li>Anonymous Proxy &amp; Proxy Score: what is the likelihood that the user is utilizing an anonymous proxy?</li>
<li>Carder E-mail: is the user ordering from an e-mail address that has been used for fraudulent orders?</li>
<li>High Risk Username/Passwords: is the user utilizing a username or password used previously for fraud?</li>
<li>Ship Forwarding Address: is the user specifying a known drop shipping address</li>
</ul>
<p>IP/GEO/BIN Scrubbing (Continued)</p>
<p>Open/Anonymous Proxies: an open proxy is often a compromised “zombie” computer running a proxy service that was installed by a computer virus or hacker. The computer is then used to commit credit card fraud or other illegal activity. In some circumstances, an open proxy may be a legitimate anonymizing service that is simply recycling its IP addresses. Detecting anonymous proxies is always an on going battle as new ones pop up and may remain undetected for some time.</p>
<p>26% of orders placed with from open proxies on the MaxMind min Fraud service ended up being fraudulent. Extra verification steps are strongly recommended for any transaction originating from anopen/anonymous proxy.</p>
<p>High-Risk Countries: these are countries that have a disproportionate amount of fraudulent orders, specificallyEgypt, Ghana, Indonesia, Lebanon, Macedonia, Morocco,Nigeria, Pakistan, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, Ukraine and Vietnam. 32% of orders placed through the MaxMind min Fraud service from high-risk countries were fraudulent. Extra verification steps should be required for any transaction originating from a high risk country.</p>
<p>Country Mismatch: this takes place when the IP geolocation country of the customer does not match their billing country. 21% of orders placed with a country mismatch on the MaxMind m******* service ended up being fraudulent. Extra verification steps are recommended for any transaction with a country mismatch.</p>
<p>Results that speak for themselves:</p>
<p>ChangeIP – is a DNS and domain name registration provider. The company provides free and custom Dynamic DNS services to more than 50,000 users. Before implementing MaxMind, ChangeIP was losing as much as $1,000 per month because it sold instantly delivered digital goods and could not recover the losses if the purchase turned out to be fraudulent. After implementing MaxMind, losses were reduced by 90%.</p>
<p>MeccaHosting – is a Web hosting company based in Colorado. Since integrating MaxMind, Mecca Hosting has not received a single chargeback. On average, 12-15 fraudulent orders pass through the in-house checks each month but are flagged by MaxMind. Over the last 5 months, this has saved MeccaHosting atleast 60 chargebacks and $6,000 in unnecessary costs.</p>
<p>Red Fox UK – is a Web hosting provider and software development company based in the UK which offers solutions for smalland medium sized businesses all over the world. By using MaxMind, Red Fox UK was able to increase its revenue by 4% while reducing its chargebacks by 90%.</p>
<p>365 Inc. – is a digital media and e-tailer specializing in soccer &amp; rugby with a large international customer base that processes over 10,000 transactions per month. By integrating MaxMind, chargebacks were reduced byover 96% from more than $10,000 per month to less than $500 per month. At this point, most charge backs are general order disputes as opposed to fraud.</p>
<p>Whew. A lot of editing. I&#8217;ll post the remainder in a bit.</p>

<li>Most gateways provide an AVS configuration area where you can specify whether you want to automatically“decline” (i.e. do not settle) an authorization that has an AVS mis-match or non-match.</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to implement Limitations</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Works only for U.S., CND, U.K. cardholders so this does not help you scrub most international transactions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A growing % of compromised credit cards – especially those obtained through inside jobs or hacked databases– will also contain the necessary information to provide a valid AVS match result.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendation</p>
<ul>
<li>If you handle a mix of int’l and U.S. sales, you will want consider scrubbing with AVS on the U.S. transactions but do NOT scrub via AVS for any international transactions as they will always fail. AVS should not beconsidered a primary means of verifying the validity of a transaction. Nearly 20% of the fraud can potentially be eliminated by scrubbing “Non-Matched” AVS match results.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CVV – Card Verification Value</strong></p>
<p>How It Works</p>
<ul>
<li>A service with many names – CVV2, CVC2, CID – but the premise is the same for all.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Provides a Match or Non-Match Result for the 3-digit or 4-digit number embossed on the back of the cardholder’s card. The CVV is NOT generally encoded on the magnetic stripe and therefore is less likely to be captured as part of a card skimming tactic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation</p>
<ul>
<li>Available on any Internet merchant account and virtually any Payment Gateway.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Most gateways provide an CVV configuration area where you can specify whether you want to automatically “decline” (i.e. do notsettle) an authorization that has an CVV non-match or non-entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>Works for virtually ALL cardholder accounts – both U.S. and international.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is no valid reason why a legitimate cardholder, in possession of the card, would not be able to enter a 100% matching numberfor this.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Merchants are not allowed to store CVV and as such the CVV # is less vulnerable than the data used for AVS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations</p>
<ul>
<li>CVV data can only be used for a real-time transaction. CVV data can not be stored and therefore can not be utilized for Recurring Transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendation</p>
<ul>
<li>CVV is a recommended service to utilize for ALL initial transactions processed. Based on our internal charge-back analysis, merchants can reduce their fraud ratesby as much as 70% by simply requiring a matching CVV result.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IP/GEO/BIN Scrubbing</strong></p>
<p>How It Works</p>
<ul>
<li>Compares the IP address of the customer purchasing with their stated geographic location (i.e. why is the customer from California ordering from Europe?)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Compares the BIN # (first 6 digits) of the credit card with the IP or stated geographic location of the customer (i.e. the customer isusing an US-issued credit card but they are from Europe?)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Based on the IP and BIN # and other customer-inputted data, a vast amount of information can be returned on the transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom direct integration into a service such as MaxMind.com</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Use an existing integration that is part of a Shopping Cart such as X-Cart, LiteCommerce, osCommerce, ZenCart,ASPDotNetStorefront.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Use an existing integration that is part of a Billing System such as WHMCompleteSolution, ClientExec or Ubersmith.</li>
</ul>
<p>•Use an existing integration that is part of a Payment Gateway such as the Quantum Payment Gateway.</p>
<p>Benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast, Cost Effective and Non-Intrusive</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Provides merchants with an excellent “do the pieces fit consistently?” analysis.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Can block up to 89% of all fraud if properly implemented</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally not reliable for AOL users due to the way that AOL routes its traffic (AOL users require a merchant-specific approach)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Proxy database is always in a real-time process of being updated as new proxies open up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendation</p>
<ul>
<li>IP/GEO/BIN fraud scores should be used in the order evaluation process more as a means of flagging transactions as “high risk” formore intensive scrubbing vs. being an outright decline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of what IP Geo-Location can tell you:</p>
<p>YELLOW ALERTS</p>
<ul>
<li>Free E-mail Address: is the user ordering from a free e-mail address?</li>
<li>Customer Phone #: does the customer phone # match the user’s billing location? (Only for U.S.)</li>
<li>BIN Country Match: does the BIN # from the card match the country the user states they are in?</li>
<li>BIN Issuing Bank Name: does the user’s inputted name for the bank match the database for that BIN?</li>
<li>BIN Phone Match: does the customer service phone # given by the user match the database for that BIN?</li>
</ul>
<p>RED ALERTS</p>
<ul>
<li>Country Match: does the country that the user is ordering from match where they state they are ordering from?</li>
<li>High Risk Country: is the user ordering from one of the designated high risk countries?</li>
<li>Anonymous Proxy &amp; Proxy Score: what is the likelihood that the user is utilizing an anonymous proxy?</li>
<li>Carder E-mail: is the user ordering from an e-mail address that has been used for fraudulent orders?</li>
<li>High Risk Username/Passwords: is the user utilizing a username or password used previously for fraud?</li>
<li>Ship Forwarding Address: is the user specifying a known drop shipping address</li>
</ul>
<p>IP/GEO/BIN Scrubbing (Continued)</p>
<p>Open/Anonymous Proxies: an open proxy is often a compromised “zombie” computer running a proxy service that was installed by a computer virus or hacker. The computer is then used to commit credit card fraud or other illegal activity. In some circumstances, an open proxy may be a legitimate anonymizing service that is simply recycling its IP addresses. Detecting anonymous proxies is always an on going battle as new ones pop up and may remain undetected for some time.</p>
<p>26% of orders placed with from open proxies on the MaxMind min Fraud service ended up being fraudulent. Extra verification steps are strongly recommended for any transaction originating from an open/anonymous proxy.</p>
<p><strong>High-Risk Countries:</strong> these are countries that have a disproportionate amount of fraudulent orders, specificallyEgypt, Ghana, Indonesia, Lebanon, Macedonia, Morocco,Nigeria, Pakistan, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, Ukraine and Vietnam. 32% of orders placed through the MaxMind min Fraud service from high-risk countries were fraudulent. Extra verification steps should be required for any transaction originating from a high risk country.</p>
<p>Country Mismatch: this takes place when the IP geolocation country of the customer does not match their billing country. 21% of orders placed with a country mismatch on the MaxMind m******* service ended up being fraudulent. Extra verification steps are recommended for any transaction with a country mismatch.</p>
<p>Results that speak for themselves:</p>
<p>ChangeIP – is a DNS and domain name registration provider. The company provides free and custom Dynamic DNS services to more than 50,000 users. Before implementing MaxMind, ChangeIP was losing as much as $1,000 per month because it sold instantly delivered digital goods and could not recover the losses if the purchase turned out to be fraudulent. After implementing MaxMind, losses were reduced by 90%.</p>
<p>MeccaHosting – is a Web hosting company based in Colorado. Since integrating MaxMind, Mecca Hosting has not received a single chargeback. On average, 12-15 fraudulent orders pass through the in-house checks each month but are flagged by MaxMind. Over the last 5 months, this has saved MeccaHosting atleast 60 chargebacks and $6,000 in unnecessary costs.</p>
<p>Red Fox UK – is a Web hosting provider and software development company based in the UK which offers solutions for smalland medium sized businesses all over the world. By using MaxMind, Red Fox UK was able to increase its revenue by 4% while reducing its chargebacks by 90%.</p>
<p>365 Inc. – is a digital media and e-tailer specializing in soccer &amp; rugby with a large international customer base that processes over 10,000 transactions per month. By integrating MaxMind, chargebacks were reduced byover 96% from more than $10,000 per month to less than $500 per month. At this point, most charge backs are general order disputes as opposed to fraud.</p>
<p>This is only a small part of the e-commerce as you can see there are lot’s of opinions on how to do business in the Black market and understanding how it’s done can help us to figure out solution for legit business in the future. -<em><span style="color: #993300;"> gATO oUt</span></em></p>

<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em>gATO wAs-</em></span> reading Forbes -Jon Matonis article about the shadow economy and bitcoins. The Bitcoin market is $10 Trillion and growing the crypto-currency is surpassing everyones imagination and why is that. System D is the answer, what is System D? It is a shorthand term that refers to a manner of responding to challenges that requires one to have the ability to think fast, to adapt, and to improvise when getting a job done. This can be applied to hackers, Anonymous, hacktivist and of course the Tor-Onion network.  They are all System D and growing because of it.</p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #993300;">System D is a slang phrase pirated from French-speaking Africa and the Caribbean. The French have a word that they often use to describe particularly effective and motivated people. They call them débrouillards. To say a man is a débrouillard is to tell people how resourceful and ingenious he is. The former French colonies have sculpted this word to their own social and economic reality. They say that inventive, self-starting, entrepreneurial merchants who are doing business on their own, without registering or being regulated by the bureaucracy and, for the most part, without paying taxes, are part of “l’economie de la débrouillardise.” Or, sweetened for street use, “Systeme D.” This essentially translates as the ingenuity economy, the economy of improvisation and self-reliance, the do-it-yourself, or DIY, economy.</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Essentially, bitcoin is the ‘System D’ of currencies — global, decentralized, and non-state sanctioned. In todays world were Greece, Spain and the U.S economy are falling apart we now have a currency that is not controlled by one governments it’s control by the people, and the powers that be the bankers are really pissed off.  This is why the <em><span style="color: #993300;">“deep dark web” is being vilified</span></em>. You hear about Silk Roads selling drugs and all kind of scary thing but in reality the black market is only a small portion of the dark web, but Bitcoins are a big part in it’s e-commerce and it’s not traceable that the bad part and the good part. You at home can set up a Bitcoin miner on your computer and start mining Bitcoins at home with a spare computer. It’s like a solar power cell on your roof top, or a windmill you can be in control of things again.</p>
<p>But the real issue is control! The bankers have no control of this new emerging economy. <em><span style="color: #993300;">The 1% fear</span> </em>that if we the people start using this new currency we will diminish their power, their wealth and they can’t have that. <em><span style="color: #993300;">Bitcoins are barley 3 years old</span> </em>and you hear everywhere that only criminals use it, it’s part of the bad guy’s and another fact that escapes people since it’s a crypto thing and we are talking about MATH they can only generate bit coins till 2030 so this is not the solution for a currency but at least we know where the end lies and we can make it better when nobody is in control.</p>
<p>History tell’s us that the robber (banker) barons use the same trick to spread rumors and crash the stock market in the early 1920, then they put in laws to get every one to sell their gold so they control it. We did have a currency based on Gold but they wanted this power and they payed the politicians off and got all our gold. Now they see this new currency and since it’s not under their control they want you to think it’s a bad thing.</p>
<p>Now a <em><span style="color: #993300;">$10 Trillion dollar market</span></em> will get these bankers up and ready for bear if they want to keep their power based and scaring the masses will not work when you can buy Bitcoins at any 7/11 or WallMart you can see that smart merchants are now accepting Bitcoins for the goods and services these early adopters will see themselves grow financially and hedge their bets on what is a winning worldwide currency. Governments will also go after this new markets because bankers have politicians in their pockets but this tidal wave of the new fiat currency will become de-facto very soon. Just in the last few months it has gone from $4.25 USD to today 6/25/2012 $6.28 according to <a href="http://mtgox.com">mtgox.com</a> one of the new traders in this new economy. <strong>That’s about about a <em><span style="color: #993300;">%30 percent increase</span></em>—/ now that’s a better rate than anyone can give you on your investment</strong>.  <em><span style="color: #993300;">Ca$hing -mEoW- mEoW gAtO lIke that….//</span></em></p>
<p>So what does it mean to the average person well if you have Bitcoins in your portfolio you will make a killing as Bitcoins are expected to go to almost $30 USD by Christmas time 2012. <em><span style="color: #993300;">gAtO predicts maybe $20-25 by the end of year</span></em> but I lost my tail in the stock market in 2008 what do I know. Well I know that In that time frame I had no control of the market and today because I am active in this field of Cyberspace and cryptology I can see the patterns and I trust Bitcoins better than USD or EUROs. ViVa System D:<em><span style="color: #993300;"> &#8211; gAtO oUt</span></em></p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Recently, there has been a <a href="http://gawker.com/5805928/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imaginable">surge</a> of <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/06/silkroad/">media</a> <a href="http://www.thedailymaverick.co.za/article/2011-06-03-getting-high-goes-digital-as-the-amazon-of-drug-sites-deals-door-to-door">attention</a> on the Silk Road market, which connects sellers and buyers of illegal drugs and uses Bitcoin as a means of payment. Naturally, part of this attention is attention from <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/06/05/136971766/senators-target-website-that-sells-narcotics">government</a>, and the government has every incentive to try as hard as possible to bring Silk Road down. &#8220;Never before has a website so brazenly peddled illegal drugs online,&#8221; a senator intent on cracking down on Silk Road said, and it is true. Silk Road&#8217;s website <a href="http://www.thenoisecast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/silkroad-1024x557.jpg">looks like</a> a legitimate, professionally done E-bay like service, and represents a move away from black markets in the shadows to blatant <a href="http://bitcoinweekly.com/articles/agorism-101">agorism</a> - acting as if the government itself is illegitimate. Why is Silk Road so much more brazen than before? The simple reason is &#8211; because it can. Before, the weakest link in a drug transaction was payment &#8211; either a physical meeting (risky), a credit card or Paypal transfer (easily traced to physical identity) or a mail cash transfer (requires too much trust) was necessary, so participants in the drug economy had to rely on security through obscurity, keeping their websites and forums known to few, to avoid detection. Now, however, physical delivery is the only weak link, so although the security is not perfect the internet side of the transaction is, in theory, almost completely anonymous.</p>
<p>In order for anonymous transactions to be possible through Bitcoin, however, a mixing system must be used. There are two types of mixing systems: those secure against attack from people viewing the public transaction block, like <a href="http://bitcoinlaundry.com/">Bitcoin Laundry</a> and those secure against attack from the mixing system itself, like <a href="https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/wiki">Open Transactions</a>. The first work in something similar to the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alice wants to transfer 10 BTC to Bob. Alice deposits 10 BTC into the system, and gets a 10 BTC balance within the system.</li>
<li>Alice gives Bob her one-time account key.</li>
<li>Bob withdraws 10 BTC, but the coins come not from Alice but from some other people who had deposited 10 BTC earlier. Thus, there is no chain from Alice to Bob in the public transaction log.</li>
</ol>
<p>In BitcoinLaundry in particular, steps 2 and 3 happen internally and automatically, so Alice directly sends coins to Bob&#8217;s address without Bob participating in the process. The problem is that the mixing system knows that the key Alice got and the key Bob used are the same, or related, and thus knows that Alice transfetted money to Bob. Law enforcement agencies could potentially set up mixing systems as honeypots. The systems of the second type work in the following way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alice deposits 10 BTC into the system, and sends an encrypted certificate to be blind signed. Blind signatures are a way that allows the bank to sign the certificate without knowing what the message signed or even the signature itself looks like; a more detailed description can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signature">here</a>.</li>
<li>The bank sends the blind signed certificate back to Alice. Alice decrypts the blind signed certificate and gets a normal signed certificate. She sends this to Bob.</li>
<li>Bob sends the certificate to the bank, the bank verifies it and withdraws 10 BTC.</li>
</ol>
<p>The advantage here is that the bank has no way of linking Alice&#8217;s certificate to Bob&#8217;s certificate even though it can tell that the certificate is legitimate. A useful real-world analogy is the one used in the name &#8220;blind signature&#8221;: Alice creates a piece of paper with some text on it, blindfolds the bank, the bank signs the paper blindfolded, then Alice gives the paper to Bob, the bank takes off its blindfold and verifies the signature. The bank does not know who the certificate that Bob provided came from, but it can recognize the signature as its own. This is still vulnerable to statistical attacks &#8211; if Alice deposits 13500 BTC into one of these systems and Bob withdraws 13500 BTC, then it is obvious that Alice and Bob made a transaction with each other. There are further ways of masking this &#8211; one is using &#8220;clean&#8221; coins to send as a payment; a <a href="http://blockexplorer.com/tx/83af62932681a28c6be8331b3e85b1efab8fd3734ace2ab14a4d41ae5e0193f8#o0">400 BTC donation</a> to hacker group <a href="http://lulzsecurity.com/">LulzSec</a> (press release <a href="http://pastebin.com/MQG0a130">here</a>) was done this way and is completely untraceable; another way is splitting up the transaction, sending it to many different addresses belonging to Bob, but no matter what (unless you have freshly minted coins, which will not exist in significant quantities forever) there is still substantial information leakage, so Bitcoin&#8217;s Jeff Garzik cautions: &#8220;Attempting major illicit transactions with bitcoin, given existing statistical analysis techniques deployed in the field by law enforcement, is pretty damned dumb.&#8221; Minor illicit transactions, on the other hand, are easy to hide, and the sales currently made on Silk Road are almost all below 10 BTC.</p>
<p>Silk Road itself uses an internal mixing system of the first type, so it does have the weakness that users must trust it. The fact that the system is internal is itself a weakness: even if one cannot tell which drug someone bought, the fact that someone bought <em>something</em> off of Silk Road is easier to deduce, although there is always plausible deniability, since some legal products are sold there. Silk Road promises to delete the physical address of the buyer as soon as the transaction is complete, but there is no way to prove this. Because of this trust, it is a good idea for Silk Road users to use their own anonymity protection in addition to Silk Road&#8217;s: using another bitcoin mixer, like BitcoinLaundry or using a bank as a mixer, like <a href="https://www.mybitcoin.com/">MyBitcoin</a>, adds a layer of obfuscation to the transaction, and use of post boxes under fake IDs or someone else&#8217;s house is often advised on Silk Road forums.</p>
<p>The de facto anonymity of Bitcoin can be increased by frequent use of mixers, and it is important to note that many types of services can be used as mixers: bitcoin accounts like MyBitcoin, Bitcoin poker sites and <a href="http://witcoin.com/">witcoin</a>, no matter what their purpose, can be used. A startup promising <a href="http://invested.in/P1064/bitcoin-debit-cards">Bitcoin debit cards</a> and <a href="http://bitbills.com/">Bitbills</a>offer the option to buy bitcoins anonymously physically, once again removing all traces of where they came from. As services like these are integrated into the Bitcoin economy, it may ultimately become impossible for investigators to see where coins came from more than 4 or 5 transactions back.</p>
<p>The senators&#8217; attack against Silk Road does have serious consequences for the Bitcoin economy, since the price of Bitcoin would likely fall considerably without Silk Road users&#8217; demand for the currency, but the government&#8217;s focus seems to be on Silk Road itself, not Bitcoin. Looking at some of Charles Schumer&#8217;s comments <a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Schumer-Calls-on-Feds-to-Shut-Down-Online-Drug-Marketplace-123187958.html">in this article</a>, there is a lot of anger toward the brazenness of Silk Road, but no desire to attack the Bitcoin that is behind it. Senator Charles Schumer<a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110605/22322814558/senator-schumer-says-bitcoin-is-money-laundering.shtml">recognizes</a> that Bitcoin is &#8220;an online form of money laundering used to disguise the source of money, and to disguise who&#8217;s both selling and buying the drug&#8221;, but it is not, for now, the focus. Schumer clearly does not see Bitcoin as being of prime importance in allowing internet drug users&#8217; blatantness to reach the level that it did, although his opinion should not necessarily be taken seriously: like most government officials, Schumer is not an expert in internet technological issues, since he <a href="http://www.fox23news.com/mostpopular/story/Schumer-calls-on-DEA-and-DOJ-to-shut-down-website/4DbcppsUrUq6p7tJRUsa_A.cspx">advocated (see last paragraph)</a> seizing Silk Road&#8217;s domain name, even though Silk Road currently does not even use a domain name and operates only as a .onion hidden service visible on the Tor network. The DEA, upon investigating, may turn government eyes toward Bitcoin, but this will take some time. It is important to note that some parts of the government are already aware of Bitcoin: Gavin&#8217;s speech to the CIA on Bitcoin is <a href="http://forum.bitcoin.org/?PHPSESSID=661326296d9e1ee03a776b0b80dedf1d&amp;topic=6652.msg97181#msg97181">due to take place</a> on June 14. Given that Gavin received the invitation to speak as early as April, the CIA has known about Bitcoin for some time and is not interested in a direct attack on it, and they will not change their course of action until they review Gavin&#8217;s comments at the conference. Whatever the response against Silk Road may be, for at least a couple of weeks Bitcoin is safe.</p>

<p><strong>Reloadable Debit Cards - Basics</strong></p>
<p>Greendot and other Reloadable debit cards can be used in an attempt to allow for anonymous financial transfer between customers and vendors. Vendors need to cash money out. They can accomplish this by setting up Greendot cards with stolen identities and getting them shipped to mail boxes set up with fake identification cards. Customers need to load money in. They can do this by going to any store that sells Greendot reload</p>
<div id="attachment_2604" style="width: 285px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/moneytree.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2604" title="moneytree" src="http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/moneytree.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="183" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Summer is here so plant your money garden &#8211; mAyBe -sI -nO</p></div>
<p>paks. Customers merely hand the clerk some cash and in return get a cardboard card with a load number on it. The customer can transfer this load number to the vendor via an encrypted and anonymous channel. The vendor then applies the loaded funds to the card via the internet. The loaded funds can then be cashed out at an ATM.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>These cards should be viewed as financial networks. The financial information consists of the traffic and the cards are the nodes. Reloadable debit card networks have a high degree of cross network contamination. One additional network involved is the mail system, the vendor is required to have the card shipped to a physical mail box. This may not be particularly risky due to the fact that it is unlikely the card is being watched at this point as no customers are aware of it yet. However it is important for vendors to remember that the reloadable debit card company will keep their box information on record. Another network the vendor needs to utilize is the telecommunications network. Vendors are required to talk over a telephone to activate the card. The risk inherent in this can be minimized if the vendor uses a burner phone. Vendors are also required to make an initial visit to a store in order to obtain their temporary card prior to being mailed one. They will likely be recorded by CCTV cameras. Customers also have to worry about CCTV cameras as they must hand money to a clerk in a store. Customers can not take adequate measures to disguise their identity during this process as there is direct human interaction.</p>
<p>Reloadable debit cards have a distinct disadvantage of being highly centralized. Vendors tend to have many customers send funding to a single centralized card. This means that a single compromised customer can compromise the Greendot card of the vendor. The only way to prevent this is for the seller to use multiple Greendot cards, one for each customer to be perfect. This is not very feasible.</p>
<p>If a malicious customer identifies the card of a vendor it is possible for network analysis to map out the financial network involved with this buyer. Records are kept of funds being transferred from a reload pack into a cash out card. The time and location of reload pack sales that are used to fund cash out cards can be determined. A single compromised customer can use this information to gather video surveillance of every single person who has loaded funding to the card of the seller. This may not hold up as evidence by itself but it is strong intelligence indicating that a person who has sent funds to a vendor is in fact a drug customer.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Greendot and other Reloadable debit cards are not a safe means of conducting anonymous financial transfer. The financial networks created by these cards are very prone to network analysis. There is an unacceptable amount of cross network contamination for vendors. The load points for introducing finances into the network are also under too much surveillance.</p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<p>Customers can out source the purchase of reload moneypaks. Good solutions may include utilizing bums and transients.</p>
<p>Vendors should avoid Greendot type reloadable debit cards. If they are used they should be highly compartmentalized (different cards for different groups of people). Compartmentalization is not possible in all cases though. Remember, if a single customer is malicious they can compromise the entire compartment. This puts customers at risk as well!</p>
<p>Greendot cards are prone to being frozen. Triggers include typical patterns associated with narcotics trafficking; cashing out very soon after cashing in, getting payments from diverse geographic areas (geographic based compartmentalization of customers is suggested), particularly large amounts of money going through a card in a short period of time etc.</p>
<h2>WU/MG</h2>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>Western Union and Moneygram money wires involve a customer sending funds to a vendor over the WU or MG financial network. Customers must go to a location that offers one of these services and hand money to a clerk. Depending on the country of the customer they may be required to show identification for any amount of money. In all locations identification must be shown for amounts of money over a certain limit, usually $500 or $1000. Customers fill out forms that are specially designed for gathering fingerprints and are usually under video surveillance.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Despite their many short comings WU and MG both offer substantial benefits over reloadable debit cards. It is easier to use multiple pseudonyms for pick up from these services, the number of pseudonyms you have is limited only by the number of fake ID cards you can get. Unlike with Reloadable debit cards vendors are not required to use stolen identities. They are also not required to set up mail boxes or make telephone calls (WU). The ability to easily use multiple pseudonyms makes it easier to decentralize and compartmentalize the financial networks. If a different fake ID is used for each customer, a single malicious customer will not be able to map out the entire network based on transaction records.</p>
<p>It is possible that a single malicious customer could use video surveillance and facial recognition to tie a multiple fake ID pseudonyms to a single person. After identifying the vendor in a single transaction facial recognition could identify them every time they send funding, even if they use a different fake identification document. This attack is possible but it is not likely to be used against drug traffickers at the current time.</p>
<p>One of the primary disadvantages of WU and MG is the fact that there are a limited number of locations a vendor can cash out from. Customers know the rough geographic area a vendor will pick up the wire from because when sending a WU or MG the city of the vendor must be listed on the form. This allows for surveillance teams to stake out a number of possible locations the pick up may be made at. These surveillance teams can be alerted when the target attempts pick up and then move in on the target. This risk is much smaller with Greendot cards because Greendot funding can be taken out from a large number of ATM&#8217;s distributed through out a wide geographic area.</p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<p>WU and MG have a substantial benefit over Greendot in that they can be used for funding E-currency. E-currency can dramatically increase the security of a financial transfer.</p>
<p>Customers and vendors can and should use fake identification to counter the record keeping of transactions. Even if a vendor is legitimate customers may be flagged if they send large sums of money with their real identification.</p>
<p>In some cases question and answer can be used to remove the need for identification. If this is allowed or not is highly dependent on the particular area of the customer/vendor</p>
<p>Wearing gloves or avoiding finger contact with the forms can countermeasure leaving fingerprints. Using stencils to fill out the forms at a private location can counter hand writing analysis. However, video surveillance is something that can not be countered.</p>
<p>Note: Forms are designed to pick up fingerprints</p>
<h2>E-currency</h2>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>Traditional E-currency systems (LR, PX) are relatively complex systems of financial transfer involving many companies. Usually an E-currency system is structured as follows; a main digital gold company stores gold bars in a vault and creates audited cryptographically secure digital currency units. The main E-currency company runs a website that allows owners of the currency to manage their accounts as well as send and accept funding. Usually the main E-currency company is not interested in selling small amounts of currency. The main E-currency company will usually only sell large amounts of digital currency to exchanger companies. Average users of E-currency systems only deal with exchangers and use the main digital currency company only to manage their accounts.</p>
<p>E-currency exchangers are located around the world and they accept payment in various ways according to their own policy. Usually E-currency exchangers have no affiliation with the main E-currency company. Some exchangers are even scammers so be careful who you work with!</p>
<p>To load E-currency first you need to set up an account with the parent company. It is free to do this and usually requires no identification at best or at worst easy to forge identification. You should make sure to protect your anonymity when you set up E-currency accounts, at the very least you should use Tor or similar technology to protect from network forensics. Make sure the E-mail data you register with is no tied to you in anyway and was also obtained anonymously. After you have your account set up you will be given a number which can be used to transfer currency to your account. Now you need to set up an order with an exchanger, it is suggested that you use offshore exchange services. How the exchanger accepts funding is totally up to their policy, many accept western union and some accept cash in the mail. After the exchanger gets the funding you send them they will transfer E-currency to your account minus a transaction fee. From here you can either send the E-currency to a vendors account or you can cash it out and have it sent to a vendor via another method through another exchanger. Exchangers cash in and out meaning you can not only buy E-currency from an exchanger for cash but you can also sell E-currency to an exchanger for cash.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>E-currency can be seen as similar to a financial multi-hop proxy, the first hop being the exchanger and the second hop being the E-currency company. This can add jurisdictional complication to financial network analysis attacks. You must make sure to follow normal operational security procedures when using E-currency, for example make sure to use anonymizers when interacting with the digital website and use fake identification for loading currency if possible. E-currency can also be used to create highly decentralized overlay networks, further adding to security of both customers and vendors.</p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<p>If a vendor accepts WU but not E-currency customers can use E-currency to send WU. After loading E-currency merely cash it out via another exchanger to the WU details of the vendor.</p>
<p>Vendors can decentralize their financial networks by creating new E-currency accounts for each customer. Although this is time intensive the benefits are very extreme and it is highly suggested. If every customer is presented with a different E-currency account it will make it impossible for financial intelligence to map out customer networks. A malicious customer only knows the E-currency account they sent payment to, since no other customers sent payment to the same account the malicious customer gains no useful intelligence.</p>
<p>Vendors can appear to accept any payment method an exchanger offers while actually layering the funding through E-currency accounts. When a customer places an order merely set up a request for funding with an E-currency exchanger and then present the customer with the funding information of the exchanger. The exchanger gets the funding from the customer and then puts it into the vendors E-currency account. This allows vendors to accept payment to any location they can find an exchanger in.</p>
<p>E-currency can be layered through multiple accounts prior to cashing out. It may be difficult for a legal team to prove an account that cashed out marked E-currency belongs to the same person who was sent the E-currency in the first place.</p>
<p>Online E-currency casinos can be used to cheaply add more jurisdictions to a trace and potentially mix the finances of the vendor with many others. If a vendor loads E-currency to buy digital casino chips and then cashes the casino chips out for E-currency to a new account it will probably make it harder for financial intelligence agents to follow the trail and can unlink accounts from each other.</p>
<h2>Trust Networks</h2>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>Open trust networks are potentially a great way to cash out/in E-currency. Assume that Alice has obtained $10,000 worth of E-currency from her customers. Assume Alice and Bob are in a trusted relationship with each other. Perhaps Bob wants to purchase several thousand dollars worth of E-currency. Rather than go through an independent exchanger Bob may choose to send Alice his cash in return for E-currency. This allows Bob to obtain E-currency with high anonymity and also allows Alice to cash out via a trusted node. This can present a virtual dead end to financial intelligence teams. If the E-currency was watched they see it go to Bobs account but they do not know who Bob is or how he obtained the E-currency. Even if Bob paid for the E-currency via WU and was on CCTV, the agents will not know where the funding was sent from. Cashing out of this system is eventually required unless the system continues to grow (Open versus Closed). Cashing out of a closed trust network can be done by Bob ordering product from another vendor and then selling it locally.</p>
<h2>Borrowed Bank Accounts / Underground ATM cards</h2>
<p>Borrowed bank accounts and underground ATM cards are useful for cashing out E-currency anonymously. They are also useful for taking bank wires as a method of payment. You need to be able to get the details of a bank account as well as a skim of the magnetic stripe of the ATM card tied to the account. If you can do this, you can cash the E-currency out through an exchanger via bank wire to the account you have a card for. You can now cash the money out at any ATM the card is accepted at. If you can get the skim of the ATM card, you can simply encode it to blank card stock for cashing out with.</p>
<p>I suggest not to take money out of the persons bank account unless you put it in. This will reduce the chances that they quickly notice you borrowed their bank account. You could leave extra money in the account as well, the person it belongs to may be less likely to report suspicious transactions if they are afraid they will lose whatever you left behind.</p>
<p>There are various organizations willing to offer ATM cards capable of being funded with E-currency and cashed out with at an ATM. Some of these services are scams and others are legit. Some require identification but these can be countered with fake documents.</p>
<h2>Mule Networks</h2>
<p>Mule networks can be used to help cash out funding. Obtaining a mule network is a difficult and time consuming task. The most common technique is to offer <a href="http://g7pz322wcy6jnn4r.onion/opensource/polyfront/b0tn3tz.html" rel="nofollow">&#8216;work at home&#8217; job offers</a>. People accept the job offer and are led to think that they are working for an official company when in reality they are merely picking up money and sending it on. It is expensive to fund these networks and only very realistic for large vendors. It is possible that feds will accept such offers in an attempt to perform human sybil attacks on the networks formed.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is a newer type of decentralized digital currency. The underlying system of Bitcoin is quite complex and difficult to summarize. It is suggested that you go to the bitcoin<a href="http://bitcoin.org/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> website and learn about the system. There are various ways to anonymize Bitcoin transactions. As of 2011 June 14, bitcoins trade for approximately 20 US dollars per coin. A combination of Bitcoin and blind signature digital currency systems is likely the ideal way to cash in and out, however such systems are still largely experimental and developing. Additional laundry systems were available as a hidden services, however they have gone AWOL.</p>
