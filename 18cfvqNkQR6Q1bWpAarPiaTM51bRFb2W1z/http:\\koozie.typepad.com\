Ruby Warrior Game: Write Ruby Code, Save the Day
While reading Hacker News Sunday morning, I am across a link to this Ruby programming game called Ruby Warrior. On each level, you write ruby code, run it, and watch the results play out on the screen. The game calls your method "play_turn" passing in an object that controls your character. I've printed out the code to pass level 01.
class Player  def play_turn(warrior)    # cool code goes here    warrior.walk!  endend
It even has a 80's style sound track to go with the 80's graphics. https://www.bloc.io/ruby-warrior/#/

Opinion on Gun Control
From Charles Max Wood (@cmaxw) on Twitter, I found this post covering gun control written by a former gun store owner. I didn’t want to post about this, because frankly, it is exhausting. I’ve been having this exact same argument for my entire adult life. It is not an exaggeration when I say that I know pretty much exactly every single thing an anti-gun person can say. I’ve heard it over and over, the same old tired stuff, trotted out every single time there is a tragedy on the news that can be milked. Yet, I got sucked in, and I’ve spent the last few days arguing with people who either mean well but are uninformed about gun laws and how guns actually work (who I don’t mind at all), or the willfully ignorant (who I do mind), or the obnoxiously stupid who are completely incapable of any critical thinking deeper than a Facebook meme (them, I can’t stand).
Enlightening.

VIM: How to hard wrap long lines of text?
Today, I needed to clean up some documentation from an email and I wanted to hard wrap the paragraphs at line length of 50. After searching a few posts, I found a succinct solution.
14.2. How do I format long lines in a file so that each 
      line contains less than &#39;n&#39; characters?

You can set the &#39;textwidth&#39; option to control the number of
characters that can be present in a line. For example, to 
set the maximum width of a line to 70 characters, you can 
use the following command:

    set textwidth=70

Now to break the long lines in a file to the length defined
by the &#39;textwidth&#39; option, you can use

    :g/./normal gqq

Git: Should I use 'git pull' or 'git fetch'?
While searching for documentation explaining the difference between "git pull" versus "git fetch", I found a nice blog posting covering this issue titled, git: fetch and merge, don’t pull.
The short answer is use 'git fetch origin' followed by a 'git merge origin/master'. You can insert a 'git diff master origin/master' between the first and second command to see what will be brought in.

BitCoin: A New Internet Currency?
I first heard about Bitcoin while listening Steve Gibson's Security Now podcast, episode # 287. Steve: Well, it's really, really clever. The reason that I sort of fell in love with this for the moment is, as I plowed in, I just got a big kick out of the way that the many problems associated with a sort of a floating currency, meaning a currency that isn't anchored by any central bank, there's no state sponsorship for it, I mean, and it's a real thing. Anyone who's interested, and I would encourage our listeners, if this podcast and what they hear about it makes them curious, go check it out. Just put "bitcoin" into Google, and you'll start seeing pages of stuff. And about two years ago the project was registered, a little over two years ago, by a Japanese cryptographer, Satoshi Nakamoto. And it's an open source project on SourceForge, so none of this is black art stuff. The goal is to really solve, I mean, to offer an honest-to-god, non-hobby-level, but industrial-strength, Internet-based, peer-to-peer currency where real value can be exchanged between two parties without any intermediary being involved. And that's one of the trickiest things because you've got all kinds of problems. First of all, where does the currency come from? What creates the currency? How much currency is flowing through the system? How do you monitor that and regulate it? How do you prevent it from being inflated? How do you keep people from fraudulently creating currency? How do you keep someone from, if they have some, from reusing the same currency? All of that has been solved with this system in some very clever and very new ways. Which is really what captivated my attention on this.
Next, I installed the Mac version of the Bitcoin client application, and headed over to get some free bitcoins from Gavin's Bitcoin faucet.
So far it is a definetly an interesting solution to a difficult problem: How to provide a true Internet Currency or E-Cash, which is not tied nor control by banks or soverign country. BitCoin Market Watche provides data on how BitCoin is trading against the US Dollar. Comments from PayPal on Bitcoin.

Good Sci-Fi Recommendations from Steve Gibson: Episode 277: Security Now!
During episode 277 of Steve Gibson's Security Now! podcast [transcript], he lists several science fiction novels he enjoys reading. Since I've find it difficult to pick the next book I'm going to read,I decided to list Steve's recommendations here as reference.
STEVE: ... And I'm constantly getting feedback from listeners, saying, hey, Steve, what's happening in the world of sci-fi? So as it happens, still the very best things that I have found are what we've talked about before. If listeners are not familiar with Peter Hamilton, he's at the top of my list. LEO: Me, too. And you introduced me to him, and I love him. STEVE: Oh. "Fallen Dragon." You get an introduction. It's a standalone volume. He's very wordy. But so these books are long. LEO: But they're all good words. STEVE: Yes, they are. And he paints such a rich environment that, I mean, I still see all of these worlds that he has created for me. So "Fallen Dragon" is a perfect introduction. Then my second favorite series, it's just a two-volume series, is "Pandora's Star," followed by "Judas Unchained," which is the sequel to "Pandora's Star," which is just - I've read "Fallen Dragon" I think three times. I've read both "Pandora's Star" and "Judas Unchained" twice. Because these are things you can reread, or I can. They're just spectacular pieces of work. I checked and Peter Hamilton's works listed above are available in Kindle edition. Links are listed below.
Fallen Dragon by Peter Hamilton
Pandora's Star by Petter Hamilton, book 1 of 2 book series.
Judas Unchained by Peter Hamilton, book 2 of 2 book series.
[STEVE: ]Then my second favorite we've also spoken of before, and that's Michael McCollum's books. He has a website, Scifi-AZ.com, Michael McCollum. He also writes multi-volume series which I very much enjoy. Because, again, if I read one book, it's like, okay, well, that's gone. It's annoying if the series isn't finished, and then you're, like, stuck waiting, which happens to me from time to time. But his Antares Trilogy - "Antares Dawn," "Antares Passage," and "Antares Victory" - is just fantastic. I read them all twice. And I'm just sort of waiting now for it to be long enough for me to reread them. And then the Gibraltar Trilogy I've mentioned: "Gibraltar Earth," "... Sun," and "... Stars" is fantastic. And in the case of "Stars," I read it before it was published because just to be his proofreader. So that came out. And I reread the prior two in order to get ready for the third one to be done. So that's great. And he also has many individual novels. I started reading the Antares series in January, and I'm hooked. I read the Gibraltar series last year and it was also a great read. Links are below.
Antares Dawn by Michael McCollum, Book 1 of 3
Antares Passage by Michael McCollym, Book 2of 3
Antares Victory by Michael McCollum, Book 3 of 3
Gibraltar Earth by Michael McCollum, Book 1 of 3
Gibraltar Sun by Michael McCollum, Book 2 of 3
Gibraltar Stars by Michael McCollum, Book 3 of 3
STEVE: So I did all of those. Then I said, okay, what next? Then I ran across something called "Helfort's War." LEO: You like these big long series, don't you. You don't want just one book. You don't want just two books. STEVE: Well, and here was one where I ran out before the fourth book. This is a series of four. And it's sort of the classic newly minted graduate from Star Fleet, I mean, it's not set in the Star Trek environment, but we do have like the academy. He's graduated from the academy, and we follow his career through four books. And I ran out at the end of the book three, and book four just was published on the 23rd of November. So it's available for Kindle, which is where I'm reading this stuff. And I haven't yet started because I'm just finishing the fourth book in another series of six, which is Gregory Benford's Galactic Center Series. I haven't read this four book series from Graham Sharp Paul, but the links are listed below.
Helfort's War Book 1: The Battle at the Moons of Hell
Helfort's War Book 2: The Battle of the Hammer Worlds
Helfort's War Book 3: The Battle of Devastation Reef
Helfort's War Book 4: The Battle for Commitment Planet
[STEVE:] And then Gregory Benford actually is a UCI physics professor. LEO: I like that. I like hard science. STEVE: This is. His is the so-called Galactic Center Series. I've just finished "Tides of Light," which is the fourth in the series of six. And here we sort of - we've got the humans versus the machines is like sort of the overall scenario there. And I loved, back in the day, Fred Saberhagen's Berserker series. LEO: I haven't read those, either. STEVE: Oh, those are really good, Leo. Berserkers being machines left over from some unknown alien race in the past that are out to kill off all biological life. And really interesting sci-fi that's old. It's been around forever. But now we've got the so-called "mechs," the mechs versus the humans. And this is a huge scope, like tens of thousands of years of history, but really interesting new ideas that I've never read before. And also substantial works. So I'm liking those, as well. So "The Lost Fleet," "Helfort's War," and Gregory Benford's Galactic Center series.
The links to Gregory Benford's Glactic Center series is listed below.
In the Oceans of Night Book 1 of 6
Across the Sea of Suns Book 2 of 6
Great Sky River Book 3 of 6
Tides of Light Book 4 of 6
Furious Gulf Book 5 of 6
Sailing Bright Eternity Book 6 of 6

Fictitious Web Sites from "The Confession"
While ready John Grisham's new legal novel, "The Confession," I noticed that the story keeps referring to two (2) opposing web sites: WeMissYouNikki.com and FreeDonteDrumm.com. During lunch today, I checked to see if they were registered. According to a whois lookup, they were by a Mr. Michael Pellman on October 26, 2010.
Chris
In the Kindle edition of "The Confession" jumped to location 1210 to see the reference to both web sites.
