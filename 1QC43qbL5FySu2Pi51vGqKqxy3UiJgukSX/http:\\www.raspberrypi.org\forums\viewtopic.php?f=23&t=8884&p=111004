Unless it was specifically asked for, even the back order numbers were not given out (that's how CPC's back order system works!). Unless the back order was chased, you will have had no communication; despite various statements made that were to the contrary! The only communication was through this web site and information with respect to CPC was most definitely inaccurate and when highlighted they were told they were wrong and everything was fine. The whole concept of first come first served has been proved to be wrong for many people and some posted information has not been corrected. People ordering well into March and some even April and getting devices (in some cases weeks as proven by a friend receiving theirs) before some who ordered in February. So far as CPC and Farnell/Element14 are concerned there is a massive disconnect.<br /><br />It has nothing to do with 20/20 hindsight. The position your suggesting comes across as someone who lacked confidence in what they were productising. All businesses do some form of market research. isn't that part of what the forums are all about. There are a lot that could easily have been identified as serious contributors to the foundations aims and prioritised as such (I wouldn't put myself in that category although I was planning on doing some educational stuff).<br /><br />There is a difference between taking a defensive position, and taking a defensive position when references to the contrary have been stated.<br /><br />To be fair you've been one of the more &quot;fair&quot; ones in your replies and that is appreciated.<br /><br />N.</div>

But confidence does not equal having a crystal ball to predict sales volumes. Not only was their limited money to do market research (and I'm sorry , but checking out what people are saying on a forum does NOT give you the magical  ability to predict customer sales) but there was also limited money to build the initial batch. 10k was the maximum that could be built with the money available.<br /><br />At to CPC, they are not connected to the Foundation except as a distributor,  so if you have a problem with THEIR communications, I suggest you bring it up with them. The Foundation has provided all the communication they have been able to do, but they have NO view of what happens inside other companies.<br /><br />So many armchair critics on this project, who have never brought out a product in their life and have absolutely no idea how difficult it is.</div>

It seems the reviewers all managed to get hold of some too. Then there is the EBay choice if people want to spend £190 on one. It is a pity this was not passed onto someone who could actually manage the demand a lot earlier.

Will this little rig not be $25 or $35? Sounds like we may be shelling out a few extra Jacksons than originally thought.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I’ll take these one by one.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You will be able to buy a Raspberry Pi from the end of February, from this website.&quot; Despite signing up to the website and store no priority given to those members<br /><br />&quot;The model A will cost $25 and the model B will cost $35. These prices will not change (unless we can change them downwards).&quot;  Farnell want £29 ($45)<br /><br />&quot;We have no plans for preorders.&quot; Farnell took my order weeks ago and my debit card details<br /><br />&quot;Clear enough?&quot; No not realy Q3 as stated in that article is  when I have been advised by farnell I will get sent one everything in that article is true and the writer then deserves an apology.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />I raise your load of old rubbish with the interesting information that 500k Raspberry Pi's are expected to be in buyers hands by the end of September. That's half a million. When you, Mr ManicT successfully ramp up productions volumes of a board you are trying to sell from 10k to half a million in 6 months (when expected sales for the year were &lt; 50k), then I may give your post some credit, but until then, you really ought to shut up.<br /><br />What you and people like you need to consider is that sometimes, plans change. They had to in the Foundations case because of the unexpectedly massive demand.</div></blockquote><br /><br />You can rest at ease he has to shut up ManicT was permanently banned for his post.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>jamesh wrote:</cite>The Foundation had every confidence in what they were producing. you don't put you own house up at collateral if you don't have confidence. But confidence does not equal having a crystal ball to predict sales volumes. Not only was their limited money to do market research (and I'm sorry , but checking out what people are saying on a forum does NOT give you the magical  ability to predict customer sales) but there was also limited money to build the initial batch. 10k was the maximum that could be built with the money available.</div></blockquote><br />I wouldn't disagree with any of that, however, potential sales are an entirely separate issue to how many could be built in the first batches, and others did predict a level of potential sales far higher than the Foundation and were ultimately more correct in their predictions.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>jamesh wrote:</cite>So many armchair critics on this project, who have never brought out a product in their life and have absolutely no idea how difficult it is.</div></blockquote><br />Some of those being labelled 'armchair critics' have done precisely that, or been involved in such a process, and based their predictions on such experience.<br /><br />I can accept the Foundation underestimated potential sales, can accept they could not achieve an accurate prediction of sales figures, but please let's not keep asserting that no one could have predicted the R-Pi would be the huge success it has turned out to be or only did so with hindsight.<br /><br />Most will accept it's generally impossible to predict what actual sales figures will be and the solution to that is to have plans in place for different levels of sales. The Foundation stated its own sub-contracted production capacity as around 10K per month, 100K per year, and the problem seems to be that plans to deal with higher volumes and to better match supply with demand were only put in place at the 11th hour as it was launched. There was plenty of prediction of under supply and the Foundation seems to have taken that on board, just a little late in the day.<br /><br />These things happen, are understandable even excusable, and nothing can be done about it now. I've given up caring that the Foundation underestimated sales, that was months ago and we've all moved on, but labelling those who did their best to help the Foundation as 'armchair critics' is somewhat unfair.</div>

I wanted to understand why the posting from April 27th - which has never been updated - promises a June delivery but the email suggests otherwise.<br /><br />After about fifteen minutes both the customer service rep and I have concluded that Newark / element14 has no idea when I might receive product. The rep was quite flippant about the whole affair but I maintained my patience.

In fact, I predict I won’t get one at all. I plan on forgetting it even exists. Perhaps I’ll get it in time for my birthday in November.</div>
