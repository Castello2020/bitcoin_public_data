&lt;div&gt;Is it mass or weight? --[[Special:Contributions/173.245.53.119|173.245.53.119]] 06:38, 5 March 2014 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:It says weight. Since most land animals live on the... land, there is not much difference. I suppose if a lot of aninimals lived near a [https://xkcd.com/852/ prime pole vaulting location] it could skew the results. [[Special:Contributions/108.162.246.117|108.162.246.117]] 06:40, 5 March 2014 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm really curious, what are the other, unlabeled groupings?  [http://vaclavsmil.com/the-earths-biosphere-evolution-dynamics-and-change/ Author's website] {{unsigned ip|108.162.215.46}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On page 186 of Smil's referenced book, there is a bar chart with the following values in millions of tons (*=not used in Randall's graphic):&lt;br /&gt;
elephants 0.8&lt;br /&gt;
horses 40&lt;br /&gt;
pigs 100&lt;br /&gt;
cattle 450&lt;br /&gt;
people 280&lt;br /&gt;
*whales 80&lt;br /&gt;
*all wild vertebrates 30&lt;br /&gt;
*all domesticated vertebrates 650&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; {{unsigned ip|108.162.215.46}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think that this graph is actually more illustrative of how much support humans need to maintain themselves (the amount of cattle is astonishing). [[User:Lcarsos|lcarsos]]&amp;lt;span title=&amp;quot;I'm an admin. I can help.&amp;quot;&amp;gt;_a&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; ([[User talk:Lcarsos|talk]]) 07:58, 5 March 2014 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:According to [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201209/how-many-dogs-are-there-in-the-world] there are 525 million dogs, assuming 20 kg as average weight, this should give 10 squares in the diagram. I can't find reliable numbers for cats, but there are more cats than dogs, but they don't weigh as much, so their total weight could be similar to that of the dogs. --[[Special:Contributions/108.162.254.160|108.162.254.160]] 08:42, 5 March 2014 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The blob of 13 under the word Livestock may very well represent both dogs and cats. {{unsigned ip|108.162.215.46}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Does anybody see a reason for the particular layout of the blocks? My first impression was a globe but obviously it doesn't correspond to any ontinents, etc. [[Special:Contributions/108.162.254.66|108.162.254.66]] 08:44, 5 March 2014 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Explanation==&lt;br /&gt;
Web sites and other computers that authenticate users via passwords need to be able to know if the user typed in the right password.  But storing the password itself on the computer has been known to be unnecessarily risky since the publication of [http://www.neurosecurity.com/articles/security/passwd.pdf Password Security: A Case History] in 1978.  In that paper, Robert Morris and Ken Thompson demonstrated the practice of using a slow, cryptographically-secure one-way {{w|Hash function|hash function}}, so that even if the password file is stolen, it will be very hard to figure out what the passwords are, so long as the passwords themselves are suitably complex.  They also pioneered the use of {{w|Salt (cryptography)|a “salt”}} which makes each password hash completely different even if two users use the same password.  See [http://security.blogoverflow.com/2011/07/a-tour-of-password-questions-and-answers/ A tour of password questions and answers] for background on salts and suitably slow hash functions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Adobe, however, ignored these well-known principles, and instead stored over a hundred million passwords in a reversably encrypted way, using a terrible choice of encryption methods which exposes a great deal of information about the passwords, and does not involve a salt.  This password database was recently obtained by someone and released on the Internet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In particular, Adobe used {{w|Triple DES}}, an older encryption algorithm which can still be relatively secure when properly used but they used it improperly.  It works on 64-bit (8 character) blocks. Assuming that the passwords are stored in plain ASCII, this means that a sequence of 8 characters in a password which starts on a character position which is a multiple of eight is always encrypted to the same result.  Therefore two passwords starting with “12345678” would start with the same block after being encrypted. Furthermore, this means that you can actually get a very good idea of the length of the password since anything with only one block is a password with length between 1 and 8 characters, and having two blocks implies it has between 9 and 16 characters, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Adobe also stored hints users created for their passwords. That means that an attacker knows not only if the same 8 characters are used for multiple passwords but also has some hints for guessing them. That means that common password portions should be easy to recover and that any user may be “compromised” by someone else using a part of the same password and providing a good hint. As an example, a password having three hints “Big Apple”, “Twin Towers” and “If you can make it there” is probably “New York” (or a simple variation on that). The weakness here is that no decryption and therefore no hard cracking has to take place, you just group the passwords by their encrypted blocks and try to solve them like a crossword puzzle.  These weaknesses have already been used to presumably identify a password used by {{w|Edward Snowden}}, as discussed at [http://7habitsofhighlyeffectivehackers.blogspot.com/2013/11/can-someone-be-targeted-using-adobe.html 7 Habits of Highly Effective Hackers: Can someone be targeted using the Adobe breach?].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The examples are not taken from the actual leaked file, since that [http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/11/how-an-epic-blunder-by-adobe-could-strengthen-hand-of-password-crackers/ uses a different format], and the examples are evidently cleverly crafted to make a nice crossword-like puzzle, which can be solved as shown in the Passwords section below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As mentioned on http://filosottile.github.io/analyzing-the-adobe-leaked-passwords/ the data isn't real and contains a hidden message.&lt;br /&gt;
If the &amp;quot;user password&amp;quot; hashes are Base64 encoded, they read:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;ThiswasnotagooduseofyourtimeButthenagainitwasprobablynotagooduseofmytimeeith&lt;br /&gt;
erAndyethereweareXOXOXOLetsLiveHereInThisTinySecretEncodedTextWorldForever==&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
E.g., with the initial unique hash blocks: &amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;python -c &amp;quot;print '4e18acc1ab27a2d6a0a2876eb1ea1fca'.decode('hex_codec').encode('base64')&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The last letter &amp;quot;r&amp;quot; is not fully encoded in the data shown, but any letter from &amp;quot;g&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;v&amp;quot; produces the same binary data.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The title text makes a reference to a previous comic: [[792|Black Hat’s trouble with what to do with stolen passwords]]. It also states that users of pirated Photoshop are the winners here. This is because in order to make Photoshop pirate-able, it was modified (cracked) by removing the requirement for registration so their passwords were not sent to Adobe and therefore are not present in the leaked file.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The title itself is a reference to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword cryptic crosswords]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Passwords==&lt;br /&gt;
Note that characters in the passwords could be upper or lower case, and they may involve common substitutions like &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; (number zero) for &amp;quot;O&amp;quot; (letter O); therefore, the clues cannot guarantee that the answer shown here is precisely correct.  Nevertheless, we have plenty of information for a brute force attack.&lt;br /&gt;

|&lt;br /&gt;
|&amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;matthias&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
|Although no hint was used, we know this password too, since it matches the previous one.&lt;br /&gt;

|&amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;matthias1&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
|Even without knowing the user's name, we already know how this starts, so the clue gives us a pretty good idea how it finishes (and another block useful 2 lines down)&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
|&amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;8babb6299e06eb6d&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

|Unfortunately, this is all too common, and the user practically told us that it's an easy one.&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;

Writing plaintext, I always do two spaces after a sentence ending period.&lt;br /&gt;
This is probably because I did in fact start typing on a real typewriter.&lt;br /&gt;
In an environment where automatic formatting will take place, like a web page or wiki text, I use the newline.&lt;br /&gt;
I have had people in this wiki collapse my multiple line forms to one of the others.&lt;br /&gt;

}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Explanation==&lt;br /&gt;
{{incomplete}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This comic begins with a pun on {{w|Ayn Rand}}, the name of a writer who created a philosophical system known as {{w|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism}}. Objectivists believe that the primary aim of life is to maximise personal happiness. In their view, if some humans are born more capable of satisfying their desires than other people, they deserve to reap greater rewards from life than others. In the comic, White Hat uses a similar line of reason to justify some numbers appearing more often than others in a &amp;quot;random&amp;quot; number generator.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The title text notes identifies a group of people whose names match the {{w|regular expression}} &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/(\b[plurandy]+\b ?){2}/i&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Full explanation of expression (Copied from Reddit) - to take each part in turn:&lt;br /&gt;
* \b is a word boundary, matching anywhere you have a 'word character' next to any non-word character (so normally a letter/digit next to a space or a punctuation mark)&lt;br /&gt;
* [plurandy] is a character class, and will match any single character from the set inside the square brackets&lt;br /&gt;
* the plus sign means &amp;quot;1 or many&amp;quot; of the previous thing, so [plurandy]+ matches one or many of the characters in that class, one after the other&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;quot; ?&amp;quot; - a space followed by a question mark, ? means &amp;quot;0 or 1 of the previous thing&amp;quot;, so the space is optional&lt;br /&gt;
* the whole section in parentheses (\b[plurandy]+\b ?) translates to &amp;quot;a word containing one or more letters, all of which are in the set [plurandy]&amp;quot;, followed by an optional space&lt;br /&gt;
* the {2} on the end means to repeat the pattern twice&lt;br /&gt;
* The forward slashes on either end mark out the edges of the actual pattern, and the i on the very end just means &amp;quot;case insensitive', so all the characters will match either upper or lower case versions&lt;br /&gt;
So overall, we have 2 words, separated by a space &amp;lt;s&amp;gt;(or some other non-word character)&amp;lt;/s&amp;gt;, composed entirely of the letters in [plurandy], which is what the names listed have in common.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(The original alt-text was missing the \ in front of the b's i.e; &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;(b[plurandy]+b ?)&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; -- this has since been fixed and now reads correctly) &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;s&amp;gt;This expression seems to have a mistake; the correct expression should be &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/(\b[plurandy]+\b ?){2}/i&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;. &amp;quot;\b&amp;quot; means word boundary in Python.[http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html]&amp;lt;/s&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The expression means that the mentioned people have names with only the letters A, D, L, N, P, R, U, and Y. {2} means that they have two names (a first name and a last name), and &amp;quot;i&amp;quot; means that the match is case insensitive&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I thought Earth Prime was a reference to Sliders... but Wikipedia says it's been used much more widely. [[User:Saibot84|Saibot84]] ([[User talk:Saibot84|talk]]) 04:40, 23 September 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wait, wait ... only &amp;quot;some of you&amp;quot; change your clocks? In the universe I just came from, MOST of them changed their clocks at unsynchronized times for no good reason anyone has ever been able to demonstrate. Only the Third World along with Hawaii and Saskatchewan were holdouts where I came from.{{unsigned ip|72.68.9.56}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Neither India nor China are having this obscure idea of occasionally changing their clocks for no obvious reasons. So even &amp;quot;most&amp;quot; might be a bit of a stretch. [[User:Pmakholm|Pmakholm]] ([[User talk:Pmakholm|talk]])&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Iceland (definitely NOT Third World) does not changes its clocks. It remains on GMT throughout the year, despite being way west of the Greenwich Meridian [[Special:Contributions/95.131.110.106|95.131.110.106]] 09:53, 23 September 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Yeah I think it's a Sliders reference.  Randall says he was transported in the late 1990s and Sliders aired from 1995-2000. [[Special:Contributions/184.56.86.168|184.56.86.168]] 06:02, 23 September 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Reminds me of this bit from [http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/06/27/1680102/the-lobster-rebellion.html a Dave Barry column]: &amp;quot;I personally see no significant difference between a lobster and, say, a giant Madagascar hissing cockroach, which is a type of cockroach that grows to approximately the size of William Howard Taft (1857-1930). If a group of diners were sitting in a nice restaurant, and the waiter were to bring them each a freshly killed, steaming-hot Madagascar hissing cockroach, they would not put on silly bibs and eat it with butter. No, they would run, retching, directly from the restaurant to the All-Nite Drive-Thru Lawsuit Center.&amp;quot; [[User:SteveMB|SteveMB]] ([[User talk:SteveMB|talk]]) 10:46, 23 September 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

I wonder how amount of meat compares, and meat-to-shell ration, and taste of meat.  BTW Wikipedia says that {{w|Spider#Benefits_to_humans|''Cooked tarantula spiders are considered a delicacy in Cambodia''}}. --[[User:JakubNarebski|JakubNarebski]] ([[User talk:JakubNarebski|talk]]) 11:56, 23 September 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Personally, I don't think spiders to lobsters is a good comparison.  Spiders are carnivores, while lobsters are carrion eaters.  Personally, I would never want to eat a carrion eater.  (Of course, I would never want to eat a spider either, but that's different...)  --[[User:Divad27182|Divad27182]] ([[User talk:Divad27182|talk]]) 13:53, 23 September 2013 (UTC)&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

This could be a cinematic custom to change scenes or to show the passage of time: fade to black (white) on Act I, come up on Act II. Get some popcorn during the intermission.{{unsigned|Gerry|11:38, 29 April 2013 (UTC)}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The picture does chance with time. The URL includes a changing timestamp that I can't decipher. Compare these two URLS (which have slightly different images:&lt;br /&gt;
http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/8eb156cce408df8bb83528382d6a2aa2ce6c74f3c573fd12b058cd1c56420672.png&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps there is a way to hack the URL to view future images. [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:29, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I would also like to add that knowing randall, these are not the only images. For all we know, the image will still be changing in 5 years while a tree grows in front of them. My point is: Are the URLs hackable, or did he encrypt them? [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:33, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Likely there is a way to hack the URLs; they look like some sort of hash, probably a hashed timestamp. Of course, he could easily have added some salt to the hash, making it significantly *harder* to hack. But they're strings of a specific length, so it should be pretty easy to bruteforce it, fetch all the images, and then (maybe) reverse-engineer the sequence. *That* all depends on how many of them there are.

:: The URLs are 64 hex characters. If he doesnt want us to find these pictures ahead of time, he would have made them completely random data, not a hash of anything. There are 16 possibilites for hex characters so 16^64 combinations or 1.7x10^308 combinations. If we made a supercomputer to try a billion links per second, and if there are 10,000 images total, it would take 4×10^277 × 13.77 billion years, which is a number with 277 zeros times the age of the universe to find just the first additional image. The sun will expand into a red giant and engulf the earth or at least come close enough to boil off all the water in the oceans in a mere 5.4 billion years, less than even one additional age of the universe. It will even be after the last star to ever be born has burned out, and all life in the universe has died before we could find even one.

: Given that the images switch back and forth between other images already seen, and that the comic should be viewable in the future, it seems unlikely that it's any thing like a simple sha256 of part of the timestamp.  I think it's more likely a function of half-hours and minutes (assuming we continue to get a new possible image every half-hour).

::: The images do cycle, yes. But for some reason I have never seen the img where Megan is looking behind her. Also wouldn't it be difficult to show a sequential story (like the rising tide) if the previous images keep cycling ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hash appears to be SHA-256. I tried some obvious hashes (&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;11901&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190_1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190.1&amp;quot;) to no avail. Maybe this is HMAC-SHA256? Also, I would suggest trying Unix timestamps. [[Special:Contributions/131.156.236.149|131.156.236.149]] 06:19, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I've been trying to make educated guesses as to what's being hashed here: http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator ... he could also be using hash(hash2(value)) which would be virtually impossible to crack.

It's entirely possible that the &amp;quot;hash&amp;quot; is actually randomly generated. Just a thought. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.119.153|129.21.119.153]] 07:03, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regarding sha256. Its most likely some hash of a timestamp, but if he doesnt wants us to crack it, he would have prefixes a password.. sha256('secretcode17:30'). Im just saying, if he doesnt wants us to crack it, we most likely cant.&lt;br /&gt;
I've tested all unixtimestamps from 1300000000 to 1364390334. Also &amp;quot;00:00&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;23:59&amp;quot;, with and without the colon and a load of other formats. {{unsigned|77.243.128.133}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alright, this is probably not going to work, but I'm trying to exploit Randall's awesomeness here. Maybe he decided to take the time-stamps from the user? I don't know if that's even possible... That would then allow people in different time zones to obtain different images simultaneously. (What's the corollary of Godwin's law for a bunch of math-and-science nerds and relativity? Is there one?) Clicking the img src url on the comic's html page, give me this: http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/752687b61523144c61736cd89f8c153dc41e19128f72d78d44947ff800f057fa.png : Never mind.. apparently others see the same image too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Could he be doing this live? Monitoring the discussion on the net? Collaborative, crowdsourced comic-ing? Reminds me of those you-decide-what-the-character-does-next-and-flip-to-appropriate-page parallel plot novels.&lt;br /&gt;

Is it just me or or did Randall manage to make all of us perform a Denial of Service on xkcd.com, and explainxkcd.com ? xkcd.com seems much slower, and I keep getting &amp;quot;500 Internal server error&amp;quot; when accessing this site (explainxkcd.com).

Earlier today, the server handled all the image redirections. The script you see above went through several mutations (currently at #8), with each mutation it seems that Randall is adding more servers and trying to split the load between them. This is basically how a bot-net works - we all run code written by some evil genius, and he's changing the code as time passes to serve some hidden purpose.&lt;br /&gt;

For those wondering about the Javascript behind this: I posted my analysis of the Javascript [http://www.echochamber.me/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=101043&amp;amp;start=760#p3303579 on the xkcd forums], and further de-obfuscated and annotated the code over on [https://gist.github.com/cincodenada/5246094 GitHub].  Here's a quick summary though: it holds open a connection to xkcd's servers and listens for instructions and follows them. Those instructions are either &amp;quot;load a new image&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;reload the page&amp;quot;. So, you don't have to mash F5, it will automatically update the image when they're available. We have no way to control how fast the images come or when they do, and it's quite possible for them to update forever. --[[User:Fiveofoh|Fiveofoh]] ([[User talk:Fiveofoh|talk]]) 06:41, 27 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a series of animation frames.

Call me a paranoid, but I think this strip is all about 9/11:&lt;br /&gt;
*If you read the strip number (1190) backwards, you get 09/11&lt;br /&gt;
*This subject is recurrent on xkcd&lt;br /&gt;
*As far as we have seen, there is a destroyed tower and they are rebuilding it&lt;br /&gt;
*The next strip, following 1190 (or 09/11), mentions war against countries with large oil reserves but low military capacity. {{unsigned|143.107.105.14}}&lt;br /&gt;
:I feel like that's kind of a stretch, I'm pretty sure it's just a story about a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If a new strip goes up every 30 minutes our time, and if each strip comprises of, let's say for the sake of simplicity, one minute in their time; to build the sand castle [frames 24-117 = 93 frames] so far it's taken almost 2 days our time, which would be about an hour and a half their time if each frame is a minute.  Using my scale, an hour our time is 2 minutes their time, a day is 48 minutes, and our month is their 24 hour day.  If we assume Randall plans to give us a 24 hour period from that world's time, and we use the minute-per-frame rate I made up, than we'd probably be looking at a month of images our time.  I guess we'll just have to see how long he's got it planned to go on. -boB&lt;br /&gt;

It's zooming out! When look at the gifs showing the frames in succession, the last 3 show the castle getting slightly smaller each time!&lt;br /&gt;

Strange: As far as I know http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time.png always redirects to the current frame. But if you visit the current one (133:00) at http://xkcd.com/1190/ and check the displayed image, it says 'c6976fbb244af4fc2286ffe3ac2cf78d408c1f610ecd71e18b4a677a048f084d.png' while time.png redirects to '1d9ce7199935b1b629d6b8744e62c7700a3780357b2dc74bb70471db616ddadb.png'.

I'm seeing some strange stuff now. I have a script that uses wget of time.png to get the redirected hash png like Lockyy is doing. And I can verify that when you go to the 1190 page in the browser you get a different hash. But the previous hour and this hour, unlike the ones before it, the two hash pngs are different. And when I refresh the screen in my browser at the 1190 page, first I see the image I get from time.png, then the image refreshes with the other one. I'm not sure what this means or what we are supposed to do with it. I added the time.png hashes to the table for the last two hours but we probably need a way of indicating the difference. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 20:38, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

: Looking at it some more, I see that wget of the page at xkcd.com/1190/ gets you an img link to time.png and then there is the javascript that must after some delay get the different hash url image. That means that we had better be sure that we do not miss any manual checks of hourly updates because the scripts will never find that second image unless someone has a way of getting a script that runs the javascript as if it was a browser. As long as someone posts the hash of the image from the browser every hour, I can ensure that we have the hashes the scripts can get because I have a cron job checking for those updates every 15 minutes. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 21:49, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

When Megan coughed and Cueball asked if she was okay, did anyone else think of http://xkcd.com/931/ Lanes? Cueball explains that cancer treatment results are not known until much later, &amp;quot;and often the first sign is a cough or a bone pain.  So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry . . . .&amp;quot; ~~wrybred&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:I don't want to be a downer but this is just my interpretation thus far. I hope it is a happier theme but if you are correct wrybred, my further explanation would be the following... I think that building sandcastles is an analogy for living their life. Going for a swim in the body of water and the cough could represent the start of the cancer or possibly some time where they had to go out and &amp;quot;wade&amp;quot; in the possibilities of what cancer could mean. Time passes and Cueball says &amp;quot;I don't think we can build it much taller than this. It's been fun, though&amp;quot; which represents that they believe they have done as well as they can with the lives they have been given. They comment on the river retreating even though we the audience observe a body of water on the right hand side rising could represent how we can be fooled into believing things are going alright when in reality they are not. The reference to not understanding what the river is doing also fits this explanation well as someone with cancer may occasionally feel confused about their illness. Presently while I write this they are possibly preparing for a flood which represents the return of the cancer. If I were to guess what is next I might guess that they will watch as the flood comes in and destroys some of what they built but it is better than not having made the sandcastle in the first place. I could be way off, but Randall has given us a lot of TIME to think about what this is all about and your mind wanders. I also would note that this may not be about a particular cancer story, just any cancer story. [[User:Nhoel|Nhoel]] ([[User talk:Nhoel|talk]]) 13:51, 8 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

:Seriously? Ok - time to review the physics of hydrostatic fluids, folks.  Depth is the only variable in calculating fluid pressure.

::A small hill can stop the sea if it extends infinitely in the Z axis, otherwise the sea will simply flow around it. The other alternative is to encircle the castle with it, forming a moat, but then we wouldn't be able to see the inside. So this can't be a normal 3D universe. Lending some weight to the 2D or nearly 2D nature is that the first platform they put up was installed on only two posts. But the platform itself had width.

If this were a 2D universe, wouldn't the best course of action be to bury one of the poles directly at the water's edge?

I'm guessing that the water will keep rising indefinitely, and we'll be left with an upward-moving strip that occasionally zooms out as the bottom layers are very slowly filled in with black &amp;quot;water.&amp;quot; One thing that would make this interesting is the varying heights of the constructed structures (sandcastle turrets, platform, etc.) which would make the process of &amp;quot;overflow&amp;quot; from the right-hand side interesting to watch. {{unsigned ip|65.96.75.37}}&lt;br /&gt;

Oh the symbolism of it: Cueball leaves, Megan finishes building their castle, rests and lets her guard down.

I'm expecting the lower level-castle to be swept away by the water, while the high-level castle will remain intact. This is quite reasonable, assuming Cueball and Megan knows how high the flood will come and thus they built the platform to an appropriate height. It may be interpreted as the lower-level castle being the work of our life, which is inevitable finite, and will be eventually overtaken by death. Recognizing this, some choose to build a castle for the &amp;quot;after-life&amp;quot;. Life-death reflections have been common on xkcd in the past as well. {{unsigned ip|149.241.18.229}}&lt;br /&gt;

For me, this is clearly about cancer and the impacts it has on a relationship over time. Randall's now wife was diagnosed and treated for cancer recently and through this comic, he's trying to portray the anxious wait they faced through treatment and remission.  He has put us into his shoes by keeping us waiting in suspense to see how things end up.  The passing of time represents their life together.  At first it's just them relaxing together, probably the dating phase.  Soon they start building a life together, represented by the sand castle.  The castle evolves over time, much like their life has.  Difficulties and gaffes in their relationship are depicted, for example when cueball trips and breaks down part of the wall.  Eventually all efforts are diverted and put into defending against the approaching sea, which represents the cancer.  The wall, the platform, all represent the steps taken to prevent and/or prepare for it's impending progress.  The river represents the cure for cancer, which is still pretty far out, as cueball mentioned.  There are many many more clues I see and explanations I can give to support this idea (castle in the sky, the rain, progress with research, etc.), but this is just starting point.  I'm excited to see where the comic will end up, but I guess we just need to &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;.  --[[User:Nick|Nick]] ([[User talk:Nick|talk]]) 21:25, 24 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Well, I don't know if the intention here is that the &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; is making the &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; grow.  My point is that the dialogue is so nonsensical at points that it seems to be code.  I'm taking every noun as a metaphor for something.  &amp;quot;Sea&amp;quot; being &amp;quot;cancer&amp;quot; seems to fit (&amp;quot;The cancer can't make more of itself forever, can it?&amp;quot;)  I guess go back through the dialogue and see what other words could substitute for what they're saying.

I think this is the last day.  It's been exactly a month, they seem pretty done with it, and tomorrow's friday....On top of that, the most recent comic was the flipping of a switch on a time machine, in which, something happened, but we don't yet know what....it may be that the &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; comic is being refreshed.  ...Just a thought....

I expect that from now on (Friday April 26th 2013) there will be no more story and the sea will erode the castle until nothing is left (most likely software generated).

I agree - the water has started eroding the castle to the right, and it makes sense for the erosion to potentially loop the comic back to frame 1. That said, the title text was &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;. This could be a euphamism suggesting &amp;quot;keep waiting, this comic changes&amp;quot;, but it does have an implication that there is a &amp;quot;finale&amp;quot; to the comic that you should wait for.

The most recent event is Megan walking in, saying &amp;quot;bye!&amp;quot; in *lower case*, and leaving.  From the lower case, which is different from the rest of the comic, I infer that she was talking to *us*, not (eg) herself or the sandcastle!  I reckon it's just going to fill up with water until the page is a static black rectangle. Especially since she and Cueball just talked about going off and exploring, grabbed their bags, and left. -cosmogoblin [[Special:Contributions/94.197.127.235|94.197.127.235]] 13:57, 26 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

: I suspect the small text was to show a &amp;quot;small voice&amp;quot; - talking quietly and sadly perhaps?

:: I agree with the small voice. The sea level is still rising, and interestingly, the sand barrier on the far right is eroding on *both sides* -- not just the seaward side, as previously.

::: The &amp;quot;both-sides&amp;quot; erosion is normal and realistic.

Just wanted to say: I don't think the beret girl is a girl at all. It's a boy with an old-fashioned navy-style cap. Popular with boys at the beach (in the old days). See images here (http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x130/JTMarcus/h1.jpg) and here (http://cabinetcardgallery.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/kidwithcap_0003.jpg) I also like the fact that, just before the castle completely fades away, you can barely see the little boy bringing more materials (maybe another support beam?) to continue the work.&lt;br /&gt;
I like the continuity of letting the beret boy (not girl)&lt;br /&gt;
: Wether it's a navy cap or not may be open to interpretation (though I'd still bet it's a beret - it surely looks a lot more like the one the beret guy wears, and I think Randall would have put a little more effort into that detail if he wanted it to pass off as a navy cap). As for it being a boy, no. It's definitely a girl, you can clearly see it has a longer hair, and come to think of it, Randall rarely draws any hair at all for male characters anyway. --[[Special:Contributions/201.53.213.201|201.53.213.201]] 23:36, 29 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Odd, it looks like +861, +862, and +863 are out of order, judging by the ground not changing at all and the characters not walking continuously. I wonder if that was an accidental mistake in XKCD server's delivery of the images or if there's an actual meaning to it.

During the last glacial period the sea level was more than 100 meters lower than it is nowadays, so coastal structures looked very different and the continents exposed much more land. I believe the first act of this comic references medieval ages in Europe where people would witness (over the scope of hundreds of years or longer) losing land and coastal towns to the sea but not understanding the process, as Megan states. I'm expecting the second act, and possibly further acts, to reference the abundance of scientifical discoveries made during the last few centuries.

Well, they've made it back to the beach.  I think it will end either at 1000 or 1024, and the only reason it might go to 1024 is allow some dialog and zooming in. :-)  --[[User:Divad27182|Divad27182]] ([[User talk:Divad27182|talk]]) 18:01, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I thought that too initially - the terrain features certainly seems identical (to scale) to the one at the start of the story. But something's bothering me; it's about the frame before we see they are back on a beach - they are already seated, so it's fair to assume they haven't moved, yet the terrain is different. By looking at the terrain, you could guess that maybe the terrain is inverted, which would then indicate that the frame with the beach in view is from a different angle than the previous frame. But for that to be the case, Cueball would have to be behind Megan on the previous frame, yet, their positions are unchanged on these frames. So, I don't know... I'll stop rambling now, and just wait and see, I guess... --[[User:Fernandofig|Fernandofig]] ([[User talk:Fernandofig|talk]]) 18:27, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Wait, what? It looks like they are suddenly back at a beach that looks the same as the first one, just zoomed out. But before when the scene was presumably inverted, the terrain didn't look quite like that. If the scene really did get inverted, maybe they aren't actually on a beach right now, but the sea will eventually expand until it reaches them. Then again, we don't know if this is the same plane of space that the original beach was either. They were just walking to the right. The concept of space in this comic is confusing me right now. I wonder if this will make sense later. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.63.158|129.21.63.158]] 18:41, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

It appears that the camera perspective has changed. 1 - 970 are all perpendicular to the shoreline, with the water on the right, camera looking down the shore. 971-996 are shown parallel to the shore line, with the camera position apparently out over the water or standing at the shore, looking back toward land. (If the camera had maintained the original position, the characters would have simply gotten smaller as the walked away, but instead we got to see the walk across the frame while presumably following the shore.) In 997, the camera perspective just comes back around to be a profile shot again, looking down the shoreline, water once again on the right. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.183.156.9|65.183.156.9]] 19:40, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Near the end of the transcript, it says that at +847 Beret Girl drops in again, dragging something. I used Photoshop to lower the brightness, and can see about half of her head facing away from the sandcastle. She's not dragging anything.

&amp;quot;How long can this go on?  I would say a very long time.  Currently, each day is filled mostly with a very few backgrounds used over several comics with only the characters moving -- not that difficult to produce -- and maybe a few lines of dialog, which also allows for the repetition of the background.  He can probably keep this pace for months.  It would be a bit disappointing, but possible.  The strip certainly doesn't seem to be approaching any sort of conclusion.  But, I think, like certain kinds of art, its the presentation that important.

Has anyone noticed that the exact same identical image was re-used several times recently?

Looking at http://xkcd.aubronwood.com/# you can then see that 1111 and 1113 are also the same. The rapid perspective change makes the animation appear to strobe. Could this be some strange attempt to illustrate something like an earthquake, or are they just re-using frames to avoid having to draw so many?

== Split the movie? ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The page is becoming impossible to load.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would suggest to split the movie into pieces, for instance by making a separate sub-page for each week (avoiding embarassing discussion on the most natural cutting point). Each week can have a separate description, seven-seconds animation, list of 7x24 pictures etc, and a link to the following and previous weeks.&lt;br /&gt;

:My only suggestion would be give it larger segments. I don't think it needs to be as small as a week - after all, it loaded fine for a very long time. Maybe approx. half a scene each? Scene 1 is 971 frames long, so how about split at 500, at 971, and again at 1500 (when it gets there)? [[Special:Contributions/24.129.75.17|24.129.75.17]] 08:12, 8 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Here is a possible breackdown structure where sequences are ~130 pictures long : (number of frames / Start frame number))&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Part 1 : Sand Castles&lt;br /&gt;
 (127) 001:  First sand castle&lt;br /&gt;
 (105) 128 : Second sand castle (180) and Catapulte&lt;br /&gt;
 (090) 233 : Joining castles&lt;br /&gt;
 (100) 323 : Miniature castle&lt;br /&gt;
 (116) 423 : Scaffold&lt;br /&gt;
 (131) 539 : Plattform&lt;br /&gt;
 (132) 670 : Fourth castle&lt;br /&gt;
 (173) 802 : Sea rising &amp;amp; fade out&lt;br /&gt;
Part 2 : Wildernesses&lt;br /&gt;
 (150) 975 : Seashore&lt;br /&gt;
 (100) 1125 : Rivershore&lt;br /&gt;
 (115) 1225 – : Hills&lt;br /&gt;
 (087) 1340 - 1363 – 1379 : Trees&lt;br /&gt;
 (124) 1427 : Baobabs&lt;br /&gt;
 1551 – 1581 Berries&lt;br /&gt;
 1619 – Squirrel&lt;br /&gt;
 1640 Berries&lt;br /&gt;
Suggestions that can be discussed :&lt;br /&gt;
* Sequences should be 100-150 pictures long (with possible exceptions).&lt;br /&gt;
* Even if the image is not that big, the length of the movie can be a problem when one wants to check for details : short sequences allow for a slower pace.&lt;br /&gt;
* Good cutting points would be : two consecutive identical pictures, changes of scenery. Sequences with the same theme should on the contrary be kept together when possible.&lt;br /&gt;

It doesn't have to be an &amp;quot;ocean.&amp;quot;  Consider the Aral Sea.  The Dead Sea.  Our &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; doesn't have any surf, apparently.  Frame 1187:  &amp;quot;I wonder if it's ''possible'' to swim in.&amp;quot;  Our characters don't know whether you can swim in a river?  Have they never seen fresh water deep enough for swimming?

:This is not real life. And they know it's not real life. Maybe they are in some sort of Matrix and know about it, or they are playing a video game. They've seen in developers' blog that devs are working on a lot of new features for version 0.19, such as improved sand physics, multiple rivers, rain, salty water, trebuchets, swimming, surf, etc. But then developers decided to release part of these features in version 0.19, and leave the rest for 0.20. When Cueball an Megan saw that version 0.19 is out, they immediately decided to try it out, without even looking at the changelog. So they don't know which features made it into this version, and which ones will be in the next one. So far they have played around with new sand physics and trebuchets, tried swimming in the sea, tried to drink sea water, found a new river. They haven't seen any surf, so they think it'll be in 0.20. They have yet to try swimming in a river, or see the rain. They have also found a bug that causes sea level to raise indefinitely. They think it could be caused either by rain, additional rivers, or just by a griefer who built a giant sand generator array to fill in the sea and flood everything. Oh, and they can't just create a new private world to see if the sea raises there, because of the DRM.&lt;br /&gt;

Swimming in a river is dangerous if there's a strong current. Even slow moving water has a lot of power. The sea could be the ocean, connected to the ocean, or one of the large bodies of water referred to as a sea.

We know: &amp;quot;The sea is big&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The river is small&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But we also know about the sea: There are no waves. It's just rising. So it is not an ocean, it's just a lake. Many people say &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; to a lake when they can not see the other side.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And we know their home river is small. But right now they explore a different bigger river.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We know it's not summer so maybe it is spring and the river is rising like every year?&lt;br /&gt;

It seems like the two river halves (or two rivers) merge as Megan and Cueball hike upstream. New point: I joined all the images covering their journey since image 1150 (last stop for water). it spans 18204 pixels. Assuming Cueball is 6 feet tall (wild guess + it's an even number), they have now hiked a total of 0.517 miles (83228.7 cm) from image 1150.[[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 13:32, 10 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Considering the elaborate and fragile sand castles, the one- and two-person construction of the platform and its castle components, and maybe the latest antics at the top of the dunes, it appears that gravity is not Earth-normal.

Since this 1190 will never end, will it? I think we need some archive sites.&lt;br /&gt;

Each solution will lead to degradation of the explanation, splitting the article will force multiple page loads while removing the hash values will be destroying part of the metadata around the comic. Ideally, we wouldn't have to make the split at all, but speed considerations mean that we eventually will have to do it. In that eventuality, all we can do is the thing that degrades the explanation for the average visitor the least. What do visitors care more about, faster load times/having all the frames on one page or having 1000-odd incomprehensible and meaningless hash values?

So Cueball and Megan seem to entering a region with much more vegetation. Up until now I had assumed that the previous regions had vegetation as well but Randall just hadn't bothered drawing it (such detail is rare in XKCD). So what does presence of vegetation mean? More rainfall? Higher elevation? Also how far have Cueball and Megan travelled? I don't think the frames are necessarily contiguous - if this was a movie we'd have background music to go with the images.

The current frame (1355) looks remarkably similar to the area at left hand edge of XKCD 1110 (Click and Drag), which also features the same two characters discussing how they've walked &amp;quot;pretty far&amp;quot;.

The latest frame (1506) has two trees. They are almost certainly baobab trees. There are 8 species of baobab tree, but of those 8, 6 are endemic to the island of Madagascar, including the species which the trees in the comic most resemble, the Grandidier baobab. Even if they are not one of the six species endemic to Madagascar, the fact that they are baobabs still limits them to the continent of Africa, the countries of Oman and Yemen, and northwestern Australia. This means that the big sea, if it is an ocean, is most likely the Indian Ocean. [[Special:Contributions/76.92.118.150|76.92.118.150]] 18:30, 21 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== A hypothesis ==&lt;br /&gt;
Randall's animation is taking place in a distant, post-collapse future (&amp;quot;distant&amp;quot; is relative, here-- say sometime in the next few hundred years, though possibly much further): human civilization is back at a late-Iron Age stage of development, though maybe with slightly more sophisticated metallurgy. The reasons I suggest this are: 1) rising sea-level that is on-going, 2) they can work wood and they have agriculture, 3) they have shown no awareness of any more &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; technology, 4) yet they have no qualms about wandering off into the wilderness without what most of us would consider adequate protection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The one reason I might think it's farther into the future is the bit with the trees. I can't decide if their shape is a consequence of evolution (convergent, so that they are very similar to the {{w|Adansonia grandidieri}}), or they were transplanted (presumably to somewhere south? Higher altitude? Both? Antarctica?). Evolution would imply deeper in the future, and transplantation could be sooner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm really interested to see what the truth is, because it's got me thinking along all kinds of planes.[[Special:Contributions/184.99.231.23|184.99.231.23]] 21:38, 24 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

This may be more speculation than not, but the two turned north to follow the river and are now walking on a heading somewhere between NE and NW, which puts them in the northern hemisphere if they can see their shadow in front of them. This is also confusing since there aren't many Grandidier's Baobab trees there [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia_grandidieri].[[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 20:46, 29 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I agree that these orientations are plausible from the dialog in the strip, but remember, we're already pretty certain that they're not in the same universe as us, so we may not be able to assume that the sun rises in the east. There's no evidence to demonstrate that their world rotates west-to-east like ours does, but there's no evidence that it doesn't, either. Let's at least remember the possibility that all of these directions are reversed from what our current theory states.

== The Planting People ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what do we know about them? They've been gone a while, long enough for Cueball to believe it was fine to take grapes.  But they haven't been gone for a long time, because we've seen a staked sapling that is likely only a year or two old. They have vineyards and what look to be orchards. They appear to use tents, at least the frame we saw looked to be tied together at the top to form a teepee frame. They are sophisticated enough to do things like put benches next to trees, so they aren't subsistence farmers. Anything else? [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 18:14, 28 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: Forgot a couple of things, they have what is possibly writing (are Cueball and Megan illiterate?), and it's different than that of the Hill People, but their debris appears to look the same.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They appear to be either hunter-gatherers or have abandoned the area (for some reason - why?). From [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomadic] &amp;quot;Many groups of 'nomadic' hunter-gatherers (also known as foragers) moved from campsite to campsite, following game and wild fruits and vegetables.&amp;quot; We have seen three campsites; Cueball burried the embers from their fire (see image 1048 &amp;amp; 1062-1064 [http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/?frame=1064]).

== What do we know by the end of May 2013? ==&lt;br /&gt;
I'm trying to collect some facts:&lt;br /&gt;
:-They did build a sand castle and the weather was warm enough to swim in the sea. The taste of the water is bad, and the sea is raising.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Then both are trying to find a reason for that raise and they are starting to travel around this special river.&lt;br /&gt;
:-They are still going uphill while we never have seen that mountains.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Eating grapes from a vineyard means we are at least at late summer.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Walking to the sun in the morning is just walking to the east.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
They are also apparently now heading west, or mostly west.  Their shadows are in front of them, and while that could be west in the morning or east in the evening, they are contrasting it with walking into the sun in the morning as they were along the shore, so it's west. Presumably they were walking mostly north until the decision to head for the mountains, since Cueball has just started playing with his shadow. [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 00:50, 30 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:OK, but they are walking to the sun in the morning. That's east (on northern hemisphere, I still do not think we are at Madagascar). So we do have an other fact:&lt;br /&gt;
:-Around time frame 1700 it's evening.&lt;br /&gt;
--[[User:Dgbrt|Dgbrt]] ([[User talk:Dgbrt|talk]]) 17:07, 30 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:-If you walk into the sun, you are walking east.&lt;br /&gt;
:-They then turned to their left to go upriver. That's would be going north.&lt;br /&gt;
:-If you are above the tropics, your shadow will always lay to the north of you.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Megan says what they're doing is better than when they had to walk into the sun, and it's been established that they walked along the sea for days, so they'd be familiar with walking with the sun directly behind them, too. If they were now walking west, it would pretty much be the same situation, except reversed. It doesn't really make sense to me that she'd call one situation better than the other. It feels more like they aren't walking into the sun ''at all'' anymore. Therefore, I think they are now keeping the sun relatively behind them by going north, which indicates they are north of the equator, and probably north of the Tropic of Cancer. Even at noon, the sun would be behind you slightly, to the south. And if you're walking uphill, it would be very visible to you.&lt;br /&gt;

The map here seems to be failing due to excessive bandwidth: http://edfel.atwebpages.com/Time-Map.php&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I might be able to help with some bandwidth. If you know who is doing this and they can get in touch with me,(I'm [http://twitter.com/sevitz @sevitz] on twitter or via here) I might be able to help depending on BW requirements.&lt;br /&gt;

::No, their shadows are in front of them, so they are either walking west in the morning or east in the evening. Since they were comparing it favorably with their experience of walking east in the morning along the sea shore, they therefore must be going west (or mostly west) currently.

:::Also, they've probably turned away from the river, since Cueball thought it important to refill the water bottle before heading for the mountains. So, east along the seashore, north along the river, then west towards the mountains. [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 19:33, 31 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Snake Theories ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Megan mentions snakes with spikes over their eyes. That covers several species, all poisonous, but they are native to the American west and southwest, Mexico, Central America, north Africa and the Middle East. The snake that Cueball finds might be a {{w|Anguis fragilis|slow-worm}}, a limbless reptile native to Eurasia. It's shiny, brown, has a blunt head, and can shed its tail like a lizard, which might give it a half-finished look if Cueball saw it that way. But a stronger contender is the {{w|rubber boa}}, which is native to the western US, and has a famously stubby head and tail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This makes me think of one area: The {{w|Great Salt Lake}}. The {{w|Bear River (Utah)|Bear River}} empties into it from a northerly direction, and the area has the rubber boa and at least one type of poisonous horned snake. Native Americans of the area even had legends of the Horned Serpent. And that ''had'' to be a teepee we saw earlier. (I don't think Native Americans had trebuchets or berets, though....) --[[User:Druid816|Druid816]] ([[User talk:Druid816|talk]]) 01:59, 2 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

We've got chicks, and not the first time: In image 1830-1831 Megan says &amp;quot;I heard chirps from the night sky once. I was looking at the stars one night and I heard peeping. - It was very quiet. - just a single chirp now and then.&amp;quot; They were sleeping under a tree around image 1354, a bird flies overhead, later Cueball takes a walk. We can see some chicks at the end of his walk at images 1374-1376 [http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/?frame=1375&amp;amp;framediff=1374].

&lt;br /&gt;
:I've been mapping the journey from the start, piecing each segment end-to-end in Photoshop. There is no significant net elevation change until they started following the river. The net elevation change from image #1150 to now (#1818) is 1402 pixels = 210.2 feet (assuming a 40 px average height of Cueball and using 40 px = 6 feet). However, since this is a comic, one may assume a greater height than that actually depicted. The horizontal distance along the same river walk is 59516 pixels = 8927.4 feet (1.7 mi, 2.7 km). I don't have the distances along the sea. The average speed, using 1 hr/frame update, is 0.0025 mph, 0.0041 kph (at 5 min/frame update the speed increases to 0.0304 mph).

== What do we know by the beginning of June? ==&lt;br /&gt;
:- thanks to [[User:Galois|Galois]] we do know they did travel around 3 km (NASA is getting better on this metric units).&lt;br /&gt;
:- thanks to [[User:Galois|Galois]] we do know they did climb approx. 65 meters (maybe slightly more because 6 feet or 1.8288 meters for Cueball is maybe a little bit too much).&lt;br /&gt;
:- they are still in real nature, the most technical devices we have seen is just wood.&lt;br /&gt;
:- but they also did cross a road at the beginning of their travel.&lt;br /&gt;
:- now both are heading uphill while the mountains still far away.--[[User:Dgbrt|Dgbrt]] ([[User talk:Dgbrt|talk]]) 22:11, 4 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'd like to think Cueball is shorter, I used 6 ft because it's convenient and yields longer distances. The tallest Baobob tree is 516 px (rescaled to the running comic) = 77.4 ft (23.6 m) using a 6 ft Cueball. Note that using a 5.5 ft (1.7 m) Cueball, the tree drops to 71 ft (21.6 m). The Wikipedia page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia_grandidieri] on the Grandidier's baobab states they can reach 25 to 30 m (80-100 ft) in height, 23.6 m is about right.

&lt;br /&gt;
I don't follow this as religously as others so maybe I missed the obvious answer, but why is it assumed that we have seen all of the way they went? I alway thought the parts where they are hiking is like a &amp;quot;montage&amp;quot; in film, where lots of parts might be missing in between the snapshots we see. {{unsigned|193.171.69.65|05:58, 6 June 2013}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(please sign your posts - don't worry, we're all here out of a mutual enjoyment of the xkcd comics) Actually, I looked into the possibility a while back, but it didn't work. Randall runs 3-5 frame updates with the two walking across the same panel. As they leave one panel on the right, they enter the next on the left (and visa-verse for the trip back to the sunken castle). Additionally, I only came across three panels that didn't adjoin perfectly (one in the sand dunes and two trees that didn't continue into the next panel).

== Philosophical implications ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think the huge following that this comic has gathered - the amount of work by people like Aubron Wood and the guys at geekwagon, explainxkcd editors, general xkcd enthusiasts, the people at XKCD time wiki - raises some interesting questions. At this point we're not even clear how Randall is writing these comics: he may have designed them all from the start, or he may be writing 24 a day, going along with it, according to the natural progression of events and what has led up to now. It has interesting parallels with the {{w|design argument}}. It also makes you wonder about how it's all going to end. There are so many ongoing discussions - and have been from the start - about how the comic is going to conclude. Just as in real life we take so many different roads and never really know where we're going to end up. If we're continuing with the religious theme we could extend the metaphor even further, about what happens after we die. We don't know if we're going to just stop existing or if we're going to end up in some elaborate afterlife. We don't know what Randall's going to do - how long will the comic go on? Could it last his entire lifetime? We have no way of knowing. --[[User:Mynotoar|Mynotoar]] ([[User talk:Mynotoar|talk]]) 14:05, 8 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I believe Randall is writing this as it goes along, preparing the scenes only a little bit in advance. The story (quest?) reads more like a series of isolated vignettes, but with a few themes being carried forward, such as the quest for the source of the rising sea. I'm here in homage to Randall's unique wit and humor, and having fun trying to second guess what he'll do next. I don't believe the setting is an actual place, but we have several clues that limit its location. I see this as a collection of disparate objects and events; some go together, some not, but with some running themes. Randall may be making some points (such as conservation, ecology, and not eating squirrels); although, I would have never filled a canteen from the small river without first boiling or purifying the water.

== Madagascar theory ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm still not sure that it is supposed to be a specific place, but going with the Madagascar theory, there is indeed a native Madagascar hedgehog -- the greater and lesser tenrecs. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Still no squirrels, though. [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 20:58, 14 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:That Madagascar trees are also imported to US. Hedgehogs are a famous pets in US, even when they do belong to Asia and Europe. We are still in the US, and more precisely around Utah. --[[User:Dgbrt|Dgbrt]] ([[User talk:Dgbrt|talk]]) 21:51, 14 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:Hedgehogs are found in many places. From the shadow comments, they are on a northern sea coast in the northern hemisphere, hence probably not Madagascar. There's something wrong with every possible location I checked. The Mediterranean Sea is rising because the water coming in from rivers is greater than that lost through evaporation [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea#Sea-level_rise] and is polluted [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea#Pollution], BUT a quick check has every possible northern coast covered with cities or agriculture. I lived in Salt Lake City for a little while. Antelope Island has oolitic sand on the north and west sides and is a mountain, but no major rivers or waterfalls[http://www.utah.com/stateparks/great_salt_lake_facts.htm]. The north coast is a boggy delta, except for a peninsula, which is covered with agriculture. Southern Utah is a better match and has waterfalls, but no sea. I gave up.

:: The sea thing is certainly a problem for any modern-day Utah theory, but the tree that recently came on-screen (frame 2145) could be intended to be ''Pinus longaeva'', which would be appropriate to Utah (or many other parts of the Great Basin), high altitudes, and the comic theme.  Oh, also, if you want a rising, large body of water near Southern Utah there's always Lake Mead.  But it's probably not so large as to be mistaken for the sea. --Joe Decker&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:: I'm not sure that current agriculture would be an issue. Unless they are play-acting or in some kind of _The Village_ setup, they seem unlikely to be current-day humans. They seem strangely ignorant of some obvious things and yet aware of others. There might be a few tribal peoples living in tents that would be unaware of the next river over, but they would be unlikely to be confused by birds nesting. Or be using trebuchets and European castle architecture in sandcastles. And if they genuinely walked for &amp;quot;days&amp;quot; along the shore, it seems unlikely to be a _The Village_ setup; that's got to be 20 miles even taking a leisurely trip for just two days, and probably more.

It might be interesting, however, that there's a striking resemblance between the Grandidier's Baobab depicted in the comic at frame 1525 [http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/?frame=1525] and the tree on the left in the Wikimedia picture [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Adansonia_grandidieri03.jpg Grandidier's Baobab (Adansonia grandidieri) near Morondava, Madagascar].

I'll take a shot... The bottom part is curved and aligns perfectly with Cueball's head in Photoshop, just cutoff on the left (and the right as it goes out of frame). The rounded slice at the top matches Megan's head as well. The full slice does not match any scene to date (the only one close is 1885 with Megan in the tree, but that's not it); thus, it must be a slice from a future scene (or maybe part of a template with assorted characters).

From the angle of the ecliptic, they are at 30 degrees north, and thus it would have to be around the beginning of November, as that's when Virgo sets with the sun at 30N. So it could be a year when Venus hits the greatest eastern elongation in late October/early November.  Which happens this year, but it can't be this year as the moon isn't right -- there would be a crescent moon next to Venus. It would have to be at new moon or waning moon, and that puts it after 2037. Of course, there are a lot of assumptions and estimations in that calculation. [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 02:29, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
::Actually, for the moon it could be 2029, but there's another blocking factor: Mars should be next to Venus in 2037.  And for the next few eight year cycles, some combination of Mercury, the moon, and Saturn should be showing up between Venus and the Sun before the stars do. So it looks like 2053 would be the first matching date. And the next date after that 2085 - it precesses forward a bit each year, so it would be Nov 12 by 2085. Seems a bit late for grapes and hiking without any thought of shelter, but if it's 30N it is likely a pretty warm area.

:::Going backwards, the first one with no planets is 1981, but there would be a nearly full moon, and that scene does not look illuminated by a full moon. The most recent one with no planets and no moon interfering would be 1949. But that's purely my amateur estimation using the online AstroViewer.

I wandered over to the forum, and they agree with our conclusion of Sagittarius, and one of them had a interesting observation: Antares is gone. It should be the brightest thing in this view apart from Venus, and you can see the two stars that should flank it appear here [[http://bit.ly/12tfHNG]], between Cueball's head and the tree, but no Antares. Which suggests that this is set sufficiently far in the future that Antares has gone supernova (which it is due to do.) [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 06:27, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
:Even more suggestive of a far future: certain of the stars in the Scorpion appear to have moved.  If you go to Hipparchos [[http://www.rssd.esa.int/SA-general/Projects/Hipparcos/apps/ShowMotion.html]] and enter RA 260.4, Dec -42, and V(lim) 4.4, you will get the stars in the head and part of the body of the Scorpion. If you run it forward several thousand years, you'll see that the high-motion stars match with the distortions in the XKCD sky.[[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 08:05, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
One last thing (for the moment): The angle of the sun and planets are what they should be for c. 30-33 degrees N, but to get the constellations angled the right way, it's closer to 12 degrees north. This may be precession, which could also explain the grapes in what would be currently by the stars the beginning of November -- the vernal equinox may have precessed forward, resulting in the sun being in Virgo/Libra in summer rather than fall. 15,000 years would put it in Libra in June, for example [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 16:27, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Where in the world are Megan and Cueball? ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Venus marking the path of the ecliptic tells us that we are at about 30 degrees north (my quick-ass calculation came up closer to 31 or 32 degrees north.) They are walking east with the ocean to the south of them, and they are following a large river north into hills and mountains that apparently are less than a day's walk north. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if it's Earth, where could they be? There's not a lot of south-facing coasts around 30N. The only large one is the Gulf Coast of the US, but there's not much in the way of hills much less anything you could call a mountain close to the shore. The only exception I can really see is maybe around Mobile, which at last has some hills. There's the north end of the Persian Gulf and of the Gulf of California, but for both of those the hills are east of of the most obvious large river.  Though the Gulf of California would make sense in other ways -- rivers that only run to the sea in the wet season, for example. There's South Korea, but the southern coast of that is broken up into a fringe of islands and peninsula, there's not really a solid stretch of coast to walk east along.  [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 00:14, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:If, as hypothesized above, this is taking place a few thousand years into the future, might not the coastlines have changed?  (Especially since the &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; seems to be rising.)  I wonder if we could find the proper configuration of hills and a mountain even in absence of a body of water to the south.

All the stars are following the same parallel path through the sky. Shouldn't the stars should be following a circular path centered on the north star, and the planets if any be following roughly the path of the sun and moon? --deepfatfriar&lt;br /&gt;
:Based on my analsys (sicking a post-it to my screen so that it partially obscures Venus) things do seem to be curving (Venus is less obscured, then more, then less as I step through frames). [[Special:Contributions/99.72.154.66|99.72.154.66]] 03:54, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Someone mentioned the Clock of the Long Now, and the 10,000 Year Clock would fit in a number of ways.  The Texas original one is at the right latitude, and the Sierra Diablo mountains where it is are near a dried-up inland sea, which presumably could be a sea again, and an inland sea could rise much faster than the world's oceans.  And it would fit with the title &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot;, and explain the multi-thousand year future setting. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Has anyone been able to map exactly where the sun is on the stars? That would show where in the precession sequence we are. If it's in Libra, for example 15,000 years forward the sun would set in Libra around June at 31-32 degrees north at that point.  Which would explain the grapes and the camping without shelter.

If the stars are real I'm sure it still does map to the current time frame of this comic. Venus and also Jupiter (even also Mercury, but hard to see) did follow the sun at dawn. Tomorrow I will have to fix my (Linux) xOrg for running {{w|Stellarium (computer program)|Stellarium}} or {{w|Celestia}}.

It matches pretty well, though I think the fastest moving star hasn't moved quite as far.  So my current prediction: they are in the Sierra Diablo mountains in Texas (or what was Texas), climbing towards the 10,000 Year Clock observatory, about 14,000 years from now.

Likely there is a way to hack the URLs; they look like some sort of hash, probably a hashed timestamp.

:Doesn't really help. The script basically changes the image when something happens (probably some time passes, although it's possible there is more hidden there). WHAT image then appears is not directed by the script, but by the site. Specifically, the image displayed as first is taken from [http://c0.xkcd.com/redirect/comic/time http://c0.xkcd.com/redirect/comic/time], while the script asks for [http://c0.xkcd.com/stream/comic/time?method=EventSource&amp;amp;r=(somenumber) http://c0.xkcd.com/stream/comic/time?method=EventSource&amp;amp;r=(somenumber)] ... which is, if you get correct &amp;quot;r&amp;quot;, probably some json containing the image url.

Is it just me or or did Randall manage to make all of us perform a Denial of Service on xkcd.com, and explainxkcd.com ? xkcd.com seems much slower, and I keep getting &amp;quot;500 Internal server error&amp;quot; when accessing this site (explainxkcd.com). I guess that's the effect of having everybody hit F5 every few minutes :) [[Special:Contributions/193.239.192.194|193.239.192.194]] 11:57, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Earlier today, the server handled all the image redirections. The script you see above went through several mutations (currently at #8), with each mutation it seems that Randall is adding more servers and trying to split the load between them. This is basically how a bot-net works - we all run code written by some evil genius, and he's changing the code as time passes to serve some hidden purpose.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
When I saw this comic last night and that there was no explanation up, I thought to myself &amp;quot;How zen.&amp;quot;  I figured that Randall was going through a calm streak before throwing us the utterly ridiculous April 1st comic.

For those wondering about the Javascript behind this: I posted my analysis of the Javascript [http://www.echochamber.me/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=101043&amp;amp;start=760#p3303579 on the xkcd forums], and further de-obfuscated and annotated the code over on [https://gist.github.com/cincodenada/5246094 GitHub].  Here's a quick summary though: it holds open a connection to xkcd's servers and listens for instructions and follows them. Those instructions are either &amp;quot;load a new image&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;reload the page&amp;quot;. So, you don't have to mash F5, it will automatically update the image when they're available. We have no way to control how fast the images come or when they do, and it's quite possible for them to update forever. --[[User:Fiveofoh|Fiveofoh]] ([[User talk:Fiveofoh|talk]]) 06:41, 27 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

This is a series of animation frames. I suspect they will only ever be shown once (based on the fact you can only get the current image, not previous or future images -- this is in keeping with the title, &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot;, which passes and which you can't ever get back]. The filenames are UUIDs too long to guess, so somebody needs to start collecting the filenames here so that a proper flipbook can be assembled.

Call me a paranoid, but I think this strip is all about 9/11:&lt;br /&gt;
*If you read the strip number (1190) backwards, you get 09/11&lt;br /&gt;
*This subject is recurrent on xkcd&lt;br /&gt;
*As far as we have seen, there is a destroyed tower and they are rebuilding it&lt;br /&gt;
*The next strip, following 1190 (or 09/11), mentions war against countries with large oil reserves but low military capacity. {{unsigned|143.107.105.14}}&lt;br /&gt;
:I feel like that's kind of a stretch, I'm pretty sure it's just a story about a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If a new strip goes up every 30 minutes our time, and if each strip comprises of, let's say for the sake of simplicity, one minute in their time; to build the sand castle [frames 24-117 = 93 frames] so far it's taken almost 2 days our time, which would be about an hour and a half their time if each frame is a minute.  Using my scale, an hour our time is 2 minutes their time, a day is 48 minutes, and our month is their 24 hour day.  If we assume Randall plans to give us a 24 hour period from that world's time, and we use the minute-per-frame rate I made up, than we'd probably be looking at a month of images our time.  I guess we'll just have to see how long he's got it planned to go on. -boB&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Has it ended? All that's left is the sandcastle, and there doesn't seem to have been anything else changed on it for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's zooming out! When look at the gifs showing the frames in succession, the last 3 show the castle getting slightly smaller each time!&lt;br /&gt;
: It's true! The most recent also shows the edge of another castle, leading me to believe it's part of some kind of sand castle contest, probably including some of xkcd's other recurring characters!&lt;br /&gt;

Strange: As far as I know http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time.png always redirects to the current frame. But if you visit the current one (133:00) at http://xkcd.com/1190/ and check the displayed image, it says 'c6976fbb244af4fc2286ffe3ac2cf78d408c1f610ecd71e18b4a677a048f084d.png' while time.png redirects to '1d9ce7199935b1b629d6b8744e62c7700a3780357b2dc74bb70471db616ddadb.png'.

I'm seeing some strange stuff now. I have a script that uses wget of time.png to get the redirected hash png like Lockyy is doing. And I can verify that when you go to the 1190 page in the browser you get a different hash. But the previous hour and this hour, unlike the ones before it, the two hash pngs are different. And when I refresh the screen in my browser at the 1190 page, first I see the image I get from time.png, then the image refreshes with the other one. I'm not sure what this means or what we are supposed to do with it. I added the time.png hashes to the table for the last two hours but we probably need a way of indicating the difference. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 20:38, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

: Looking at it some more, I see that wget of the page at xkcd.com/1190/ gets you an img link to time.png and then there is the javascript that must after some delay get the different hash url image. That means that we had better be sure that we do not miss any manual checks of hourly updates because the scripts will never find that second image unless someone has a way of getting a script that runs the javascript as if it was a browser. As long as someone posts the hash of the image from the browser every hour, I can ensure that we have the hashes the scripts can get because I have a cron job checking for those updates every 15 minutes. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 21:49, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

When Megan coughed and Cueball asked if she was okay, did anyone else think of http://xkcd.com/931/ Lanes? Cueball explains that cancer treatment results are not known until much later, &amp;quot;and often the first sign is a cough or a bone pain.  So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry . . . .&amp;quot; ~~wrybred&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:I don't want to be a downer but this is just my interpretation thus far. I hope it is a happier theme but if you are correct wrybred, my further explanation would be the following... I think that building sandcastles is an analogy for living their life. Going for a swim in the body of water and the cough could represent the start of the cancer or possibly some time where they had to go out and &amp;quot;wade&amp;quot; in the possibilities of what cancer could mean. Time passes and Cueball says &amp;quot;I don't think we can build it much taller than this. It's been fun, though&amp;quot; which represents that they believe they have done as well as they can with the lives they have been given. They comment on the river retreating even though we the audience observe a body of water on the right hand side rising could represent how we can be fooled into believing things are going alright when in reality they are not. The reference to not understanding what the river is doing also fits this explanation well as someone with cancer may occasionally feel confused about their illness. Presently while I write this they are possibly preparing for a flood which represents the return of the cancer. If I were to guess what is next I might guess that they will watch as the flood comes in and destroys some of what they built but it is better than not having made the sandcastle in the first place. I could be way off, but Randall has given us a lot of TIME to think about what this is all about and your mind wanders. I also would note that this may not be about a particular cancer story, just any cancer story. [[User:Nhoel|Nhoel]] ([[User talk:Nhoel|talk]]) 13:51, 8 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

I think by tasting the water Cueball was preparing himself for the inevitable - the water is going to continue to rise and nothing they can do will stop it: they are going to drown.

If this were a 2D universe, wouldn't the best course of action be to bury one of the poles directly at the water's edge? That way, like the small sand hill, the sea would have to rise to the very top of the pole before it would flood the remaining sand structures. {{unsigned ip| 74.94.246.5|16:33, 16 April 2013‎ (UTC)}}&lt;br /&gt;

I'm guessing that the water will keep rising indefinitely, and we'll be left with an upward-moving strip that occasionally zooms out as the bottom layers are very slowly filled in with black &amp;quot;water.&amp;quot; One thing that would make this interesting is the varying heights of the constructed structures (sandcastle turrets, platform, etc.) which would make the process of &amp;quot;overflow&amp;quot; from the right-hand side interesting to watch. {{unsigned ip|65.96.75.37}}&lt;br /&gt;

Oh the symbolism of it: Cueball leaves, Megan finishes building their castle, rests and lets her guard down.

[[Special:Contributions/217.81.90.198|217.81.90.198]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm expecting the lower level-castle to be swept away by the water, while the high-level castle will remain intact. This is quite reasonable, assuming Cueball and Megan knows how high the flood will come and thus they built the platform to an appropriate height. It may be interpreted as the lower-level castle being the work of our life, which is inevitable finite, and will be eventually overtaken by death. Recognizing this, some choose to build a castle for the &amp;quot;after-life&amp;quot;. Life-death reflections have been common on xkcd in the past as well. {{unsigned ip|149.241.18.229}}&lt;br /&gt;

For me, this is clearly about cancer and the impacts it has on a relationship over time. Randall's now wife was diagnosed and treated for cancer recently and through this comic, he's trying to portray the anxious wait they faced through treatment and remission.  He has put us into his shoes by keeping us waiting in suspense to see how things end up.  The passing of time represents their life together.  At first it's just them relaxing together, probably the dating phase.  Soon they start building a life together, represented by the sand castle.  The castle evolves over time, much like their life has.  Difficulties and gaffes in their relationship are depicted, for example when cueball trips and breaks down part of the wall.  Eventually all efforts are diverted and put into defending against the approaching sea, which represents the cancer.  The wall, the platform, all represent the steps taken to prevent and/or prepare for it's impending progress.  The river represents the cure for cancer, which is still pretty far out, as cueball mentioned.  There are many many more clues I see and explanations I can give to support this idea (castle in the sky, the rain, progress with research, etc.), but this is just starting point.  I'm excited to see where the comic will end up, but I guess we just need to &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;.  --[[User:Nick|Nick]] ([[User talk:Nick|talk]]) 21:25, 24 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Well, I don't know if the intention here is that the &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; is making the &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; grow.  My point is that the dialogue is so nonsensical at points that it seems to be code.  I'm taking every noun as a metaphor for something.  &amp;quot;Sea&amp;quot; being &amp;quot;cancer&amp;quot; seems to fit (&amp;quot;The cancer can't make more of itself forever, can it?&amp;quot;)  I guess go back through the dialogue and see what other words could substitute for what they're saying.

This could be a euphamism suggesting &amp;quot;keep waiting, this comic changes&amp;quot;, but it does have an implication that there is a &amp;quot;finale&amp;quot; to the comic that you should wait for.

The most recent event is Megan walking in, saying &amp;quot;bye!&amp;quot; in *lower case*, and leaving.  From the lower case, which is different from the rest of the comic, I infer that she was talking to *us*, not (eg) herself or the sandcastle!  I reckon it's just going to fill up with water until the page is a static black rectangle. Especially since she and Cueball just talked about going off and exploring, grabbed their bags, and left. -cosmogoblin [[Special:Contributions/94.197.127.235|94.197.127.235]] 13:57, 26 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

: I suspect the small text was to show a &amp;quot;small voice&amp;quot; - talking quietly and sadly perhaps? It does look like this could be the end of the story though - the last few frames don't seem to have done much after the &amp;quot;fade&amp;quot; in frame 895 - Hippyjim [[Special:Contributions/81.136.241.157|81.136.241.157]] 15:15, 26 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

:: I agree with the small voice. The sea level is still rising, and interestingly, the sand barrier on the far right is eroding on *both sides* -- not just the seaward side, as previously. Changed properties of the sand or the sea, or both? I think the comic from here on is just going to be erosion.

::: The &amp;quot;both-sides&amp;quot; erosion is normal and realistic.

Just wanted to say: I don't think the beret girl is a girl at all. It's a boy with an old-fashioned navy-style cap. Popular with boys at the beach (in the old days). See images here (http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x130/JTMarcus/h1.jpg) and here (http://cabinetcardgallery.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/kidwithcap_0003.jpg) I also like the fact that, just before the castle completely fades away, you can barely see the little boy bringing more materials (maybe another support beam?) to continue the work.&lt;br /&gt;
I like the continuity of letting the beret boy (not girl)&lt;br /&gt;
: Wether it's a navy cap or not may be open to interpretation (though I'd still bet it's a beret - it surely looks a lot more like the one the beret guy wears, and I think Randall would have put a little more effort into that detail if he wanted it to pass off as a navy cap). As for it being a boy, no. It's definitely a girl, you can clearly see it has a longer hair, and come to think of it, Randall rarely draws any hair at all for male characters anyway. --[[Special:Contributions/201.53.213.201|201.53.213.201]] 23:36, 29 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

During the last glacial period the sea level was more than 100 meters lower than it is nowadays, so coastal structures looked very different and the continents exposed much more land. I believe the first act of this comic references medieval ages in Europe where people would witness (over the scope of hundreds of years or longer) losing land and coastal towns to the sea but not understanding the process, as Megan states. I'm expecting the second act, and possibly further acts, to reference the abundance of scientifical discoveries made during the last few centuries.

Well, they've made it back to the beach.  I think it will end either at 1000 or 1024, and the only reason it might go to 1024 is allow some dialog and zooming in. :-)  --[[User:Divad27182|Divad27182]] ([[User talk:Divad27182|talk]]) 18:01, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I thought that too initially - the terrain features certainly seems identical (to scale) to the one at the start of the story. But something's bothering me; it's about the frame before we see they are back on a beach - they are already seated, so it's fair to assume they haven't moved, yet the terrain is different. By looking at the terrain, you could guess that maybe the terrain is inverted, which would then indicate that the frame with the beach in view is from a different angle than the previous frame. But for that to be the case, Cueball would have to be behind Megan on the previous frame, yet, their positions are unchanged on these frames. So, I don't know...

Wait, what? It looks like they are suddenly back at a beach that looks the same as the first one, just zoomed out. But before when the scene was presumably inverted, the terrain didn't look quite like that. If the scene really did get inverted, maybe they aren't actually on a beach right now, but the sea will eventually expand until it reaches them. Then again, we don't know if this is the same plane of space that the original beach was either. They were just walking to the right. The concept of space in this comic is confusing me right now. I wonder if this will make sense later. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.63.158|129.21.63.158]] 18:41, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

It appears that the camera perspective has changed. 1 - 970 are all perpendicular to the shoreline, with the water on the right, camera looking down the shore. 971-996 are shown parallel to the shore line, with the camera position apparently out over the water or standing at the shore, looking back toward land. (If the camera had maintained the original position, the characters would have simply gotten smaller as the walked away, but instead we got to see the walk across the frame while presumably following the shore.)

Near the end of the transcript, it says that at +847 Beret Girl drops in again, dragging something. I used Photoshop to lower the brightness, and can see about half of her head facing away from the sandcastle. She's not dragging anything. Here's my evidence: [http://i.imgur.com/7zByxrs.png]  [[Special:Contributions/108.51.68.241|108.51.68.241]] 22:24, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

I added a section for normalized versions of the first 10 hours of day 36. If anyone wants me to add more, e.g. go back to where the fade started, I would. BTW, I used something like 'pngtopnm $i | pnmnorm | pnmtopng &amp;gt; $j' inside a loop. Those commands are from the NetPBM package.

Just a thought - In panel 1018 (time 897), Megan states &amp;quot;If we don't find something today, we'll have to start using the steam bottle.&amp;quot; If that means they're out of water... the last update has both of them drinking water at the edge of the river.

FWIW, you can get the normalized (non-faded) portion of the fading scene very easily with imagemagick.  Assuming you have the named like image00000.png image00001.png etc.. you can get a nice animated gif from &amp;quot;bye&amp;quot; to beret girl with: &lt;br /&gt;

&amp;quot;How long can this go on?  I would say a very long time.  Currently, each day is filled mostly with a very few backgrounds used over several comics with only the characters moving -- not that difficult to produce -- and maybe a few lines of dialog, which also allows for the repetition of the background.  He can probably keep this pace for months.  It would be a bit disappointing, but possible.  The strip certainly doesn't seem to be approaching any sort of conclusion.  But, I think, like certain kinds of art, its the presentation that important.  And he is presenting Time.  -Tom A. &amp;quot;Time is a local condition.&amp;quot; - wish I could remember who said that.

&lt;br /&gt;
I'm getting ...a84ff from http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time.png, but the main http://xkcd.com/1190/ gives the current image. [[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 23:43, 4 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Has anyone noticed that the exact same identical image was re-used several times recently? If you go to http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/ and tell it to show differences from frame 1090, and then start clicking forward, the following frames are all exactly the same: 1094, 1097, 1101, 1103, 1107. Looking at http://xkcd.aubronwood.com/# you can then see that 1111 and 1113 are also the same. The rapid perspective change makes the animation appear to strobe. Could this be some strange attempt to illustrate something like an earthquake, or are they just re-using frames to avoid having to draw so many?

== Hours ==&lt;br /&gt;
There seems to be a problem starting with today (Sunday, 2013-05-05): The first picture should be 984:00 and not 983:00. I'm not able to check if it's simply a bot (?) error writing down the hours or something more serious. --[[Special:Contributions/82.135.84.245|82.135.84.245]] 15:56, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Not all images do map to the hash ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I did run this great command posted here before on 13 April 2013:&lt;br /&gt;
 md5sum -b * | sort | uniq -w32 -D&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then I did rename all duplicates to image???_.png. After that I did download the hashes from here to image???.png and run the check again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First result is easy. Files are changed so md5sum for image002_ and image002 are different but content is the same. But 004 is wrong and I will update this one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 878341ab1f710e5832aa7ed5cfa66ed7 *image002_.png&lt;br /&gt;

Each week can have a separate description, seven-seconds animation, list of 7x24 pictures etc, and a link to the following and previous weeks.&lt;br /&gt;

:My only suggestion would be give it larger segments. I don't think it needs to be as small as a week - after all, it loaded fine for a very long time. Maybe approx. half a scene each? Scene 1 is 971 frames long, so how about split at 500, at 971, and again at 1500 (when it gets there)? [[Special:Contributions/24.129.75.17|24.129.75.17]] 08:12, 8 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
::It's one and a half megabytes. The biggest issue here probably is the anemic servers that managed to struggle and crash even when that animation was just a static png and the page itself was only a few lines long. When the image starts clocking in at ~4-5 megabytes, it'll probably get to be a proper problem for those on poor connections, but we're not quite there yet.

Here is a possible breackdown structure where sequences are ~130 pictures long : (number of frames / Start frame number))&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Part 1 : Sand Castles&lt;br /&gt;
 (127) 001:  First sand castle&lt;br /&gt;
 (105) 128 : Second sand castle (180) and Catapulte&lt;br /&gt;
 (090) 233 : Joining castles&lt;br /&gt;
 (100) 323 : Miniature castle&lt;br /&gt;
 (116) 423 : Scaffold&lt;br /&gt;
 (131) 539 : Plattform&lt;br /&gt;
 (132) 670 : Fourth castle&lt;br /&gt;
 (173) 802 : Sea rising &amp;amp; fade out&lt;br /&gt;
Part 2 : Wildernesses&lt;br /&gt;
 (150) 975 : Seashore&lt;br /&gt;
 (100) 1125 : Rivershore&lt;br /&gt;
 (115) 1225 – : Hills&lt;br /&gt;
 (087) 1340 - 1363 – 1379 : Trees&lt;br /&gt;
 (124) 1427 : Baobabs&lt;br /&gt;
 1551 – 1581 Berries&lt;br /&gt;
 1619 – Squirrel&lt;br /&gt;
 1640 Berries&lt;br /&gt;
Suggestions that can be discussed :&lt;br /&gt;
* Sequences should be 100-150 pictures long (with possible exceptions).&lt;br /&gt;
* Even if the image is not that big, the length of the movie can be a problem when one wants to check for details : short sequences allow for a slower pace.&lt;br /&gt;
* Good cutting points would be : two consecutive identical pictures, changes of scenery. Sequences with the same theme should on the contrary be kept together when possible.&lt;br /&gt;

It doesn't have to be an &amp;quot;ocean.&amp;quot;  Consider the Aral Sea.  The Dead Sea.  Our &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; doesn't have any surf, apparently.  Frame 1187:  &amp;quot;I wonder if it's ''possible'' to swim in.&amp;quot;  Our characters don't know whether you can swim in a river?  Have they never seen fresh water deep enough for swimming?

:This is not real life. And they know it's not real life. Maybe they are in some sort of Matrix and know about it, or they are playing a video game. They've seen in developers' blog that devs are working on a lot of new features for version 0.19, such as improved sand physics, multiple rivers, rain, salty water, trebuchets, swimming, surf, etc. But then developers decided to release part of these features in version 0.19, and leave the rest for 0.20. When Cueball an Megan saw that version 0.19 is out, they immediately decided to try it out, without even looking at the changelog. So they don't know which features made it into this version, and which ones will be in the next one. So far they have played around with new sand physics and trebuchets, tried swimming in the sea, tried to drink sea water, found a new river. They haven't seen any surf, so they think it'll be in 0.20. They have yet to try swimming in a river, or see the rain. They have also found a bug that causes sea level to raise indefinitely. They think it could be caused either by rain, additional rivers, or just by a griefer who built a giant sand generator array to fill in the sea and flood everything. Oh, and they can't just create a new private world to see if the sea raises there, because of the DRM.&lt;br /&gt;

Swimming in a river is dangerous if there's a strong current. Even slow moving water has a lot of power.

We know: &amp;quot;The sea is big&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The river is small&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But we also know about the sea: There are no waves. It's just rising. So it is not an ocean, it's just a lake. Many people say &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; to a lake when they can not see the other side.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And we know their home river is small. But right now they explore a different bigger river.&lt;br /&gt;

We know it's not summer so maybe it is spring and the river is rising like every year?&lt;br /&gt;

It seems like the two river halves (or two rivers) merge as Megan and Cueball hike upstream. New point: I joined all the images covering their journey since image 1150 (last stop for water). it spans 18204 pixels. Assuming Cueball is 6 feet tall (wild guess + it's an even number), they have now hiked a total of 0.517 miles (83228.7 cm) from image 1150.[[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 13:32, 10 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Considering the elaborate and fragile sand castles, the one- and two-person construction of the platform and its castle components, and maybe the latest antics at the top of the dunes, it appears that gravity is not Earth-normal.

&lt;br /&gt;
Since this 1190 will never end, will it? I think we need some archive sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First could be &amp;quot;1190 Time Images 2013-03 March&amp;quot; (&amp;lt;- I am calling this human readable ISO)&lt;br /&gt;
So, if you understand, each month of picture links and hashes on a separate page.&lt;br /&gt;

Next would be &amp;quot;1190 Time Images 2013-04 April&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

Each solution will lead to degradation of the explanation, splitting the article will force multiple page loads while removing the hash values will be destroying part of the metadata around the comic. Ideally, we wouldn't have to make the split at all, but speed considerations mean that we eventually will have to do it. In that eventuality, all we can do is the thing that degrades the explanation for the average visitor the least. What do visitors care more about, faster load times/having all the frames on one page or having 1000-odd incomprehensible and meaningless hash values? We don't display the individual filenames for Click and Drag even though they were more informative than the hashes here, because they hold little value to visitors; they only take up space that could be used to further enhance the explanation.

So Cueball and Megan seem to entering a region with much more vegetation. Up until now I had assumed that the previous regions had vegetation as well but Randall just hadn't bothered drawing it (such detail is rare in XKCD). So what does presence of vegetation mean? More rainfall? Higher elevation? Also how far have Cueball and Megan travelled? I don't think the frames are necessarily contiguous - if this was a movie we'd have background music to go with the images.

The latest frame (1506) has two trees. They are almost certainly baobab trees. There are 8 species of baobab tree, but of those 8, 6 are endemic to the island of Madagascar, including the species which the trees in the comic most resemble, the Grandidier baobab. Even if they are not one of the six species endemic to Madagascar, the fact that they are baobabs still limits them to the continent of Africa, the countries of Oman and Yemen, and northwestern Australia. This means that the big sea, if it is an ocean, is most likely the Indian Ocean. [[Special:Contributions/76.92.118.150|76.92.118.150]] 18:30, 21 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Regarding the accuracy, I imagine Randall may have used a data model of countoured landscape (1D ''or'' 2D, plus height) to auto-generate the scrolling/panning/rotating scenery base prior to decorating with figures/etc, but whether there's enough information to fully back-derive such a map from the ever-changing landscape I couldn't say.  I assume assumptions, at the very least, and maybe some inventiveness on the part of any given interpreter.

::&amp;quot;Simple English&amp;quot; isn't a special dialect or anything, but the conversation definitely has a simple, almost naive, style.

I counted 27 three-syllable words and one four-syllable word in the entire dialog, scenes 1 and 2 combined.  They don't seem to have a name for &amp;quot;sand dunes.&amp;quot;  They talked about a river being &amp;quot;broken.&amp;quot;  They are very playful, mature but child-like.

&lt;br /&gt;
== A hypothesis ==&lt;br /&gt;
Randall's animation is taking place in a distant, post-collapse future (&amp;quot;distant&amp;quot; is relative, here-- say sometime in the next few hundred years, though possibly much further): human civilization is back at a late-Iron Age stage of development, though maybe with slightly more sophisticated metallurgy. The reasons I suggest this are: 1) rising sea-level that is on-going, 2) they can work wood and they have agriculture, 3) they have shown no awareness of any more &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; technology, 4) yet they have no qualms about wandering off into the wilderness without what most of us would consider adequate protection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The one reason I might think it's farther into the future is the bit with the trees. I can't decide if their shape is a consequence of evolution (convergent, so that they are very similar to the {{w|Adansonia grandidieri}}), or they were transplanted (presumably to somewhere south? Higher altitude? Both? Antarctica?). Evolution would imply deeper in the future, and transplantation could be sooner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm really interested to see what the truth is, because it's got me thinking along all kinds of planes.[[Special:Contributions/184.99.231.23|184.99.231.23]] 21:38, 24 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This may be more speculation than not, but the two turned north to follow the river and are now walking on a heading somewhere between NE and NW, which puts them in the northern hemisphere if they can see their shadow in front of them. This is also confusing since there aren't many Grandidier's Baobab trees there [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia_grandidieri].[[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 20:46, 29 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I agree that these orientations are plausible from the dialog in the strip, but remember, we're already pretty certain that they're not in the same universe as us, so we may not be able to assume that the sun rises in the east. There's no evidence to demonstrate that their world rotates west-to-east like ours does, but there's no evidence that it doesn't, either. Let's at least remember the possibility that all of these directions are reversed from what our current theory states.

== The Planting People ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what do we know about them? They've been gone a while, long enough for Cueball to believe it was fine to take grapes.  But they haven't been gone for a long time, because we've seen a staked sapling that is likely only a year or two old. They have vineyards and what look to be orchards. They appear to use tents, at least the frame we saw looked to be tied together at the top to form a teepee frame. They are sophisticated enough to do things like put benches next to trees, so they aren't subsistence farmers. Anything else? [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 18:14, 28 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: Forgot a couple of things, they have what is possibly writing (are Cueball and Megan illiterate?), and it's different than that of the Hill People, but their debris appears to look the same.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They appear to be either hunter-gatherers or have abandoned the area (for some reason - why?). From [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomadic] &amp;quot;Many groups of 'nomadic' hunter-gatherers (also known as foragers) moved from campsite to campsite, following game and wild fruits and vegetables.&amp;quot; We have seen three campsites; Cueball burried the embers from their fire (see image 1048 &amp;amp; 1062-1064 [http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/?frame=1064]).

Go to a vineyard in late summer or early autumn, you will not see the &amp;quot;The Planting People&amp;quot;.

== What do we know by the end of May 2013? ==&lt;br /&gt;
I'm trying to collect some facts:&lt;br /&gt;
:-They did build a sand castle and the weather was warm enough to swim in the sea. The taste of the water is bad, and the sea is raising.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Then both are trying to find a reason for that raise and they are starting to travel around this special river.&lt;br /&gt;
:-They are still going uphill while we never have seen that mountains.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Eating grapes from a vineyard means we are at least at late summer.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Walking to the sun in the morning is just walking to the east.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
They are also apparently now heading west, or mostly west.  Their shadows are in front of them, and while that could be west in the morning or east in the evening, they are contrasting it with walking into the sun in the morning as they were along the shore, so it's west. Presumably they were walking mostly north until the decision to head for the mountains, since Cueball has just started playing with his shadow. [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 00:50, 30 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:OK, but they are walking to the sun in the morning. That's east (on northern hemisphere, I still do not think we are at Madagascar). So we do have an other fact:&lt;br /&gt;
:-Around time frame 1700 it's evening.&lt;br /&gt;
--[[User:Dgbrt|Dgbrt]] ([[User talk:Dgbrt|talk]]) 17:07, 30 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:-If you walk into the sun, you are walking east.&lt;br /&gt;
:-They then turned to their left to go upriver. That's would be going north.&lt;br /&gt;
:-If you are above the tropics, your shadow will always lay to the north of you.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Megan says what they're doing is better than when they had to walk into the sun, and it's been established that they walked along the sea for days, so they'd be familiar with walking with the sun directly behind them, too. If they were now walking west, it would pretty much be the same situation, except reversed. It doesn't really make sense to me that she'd call one situation better than the other. It feels more like they aren't walking into the sun ''at all'' anymore. Therefore, I think they are now keeping the sun relatively behind them by going north, which indicates they are north of the equator, and probably north of the Tropic of Cancer. Even at noon, the sun would be behind you slightly, to the south. And if you're walking uphill, it would be very visible to you.&lt;br /&gt;

== Snake Theories ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Megan mentions snakes with spikes over their eyes. That covers several species, all poisonous, but they are native to the American west and southwest, Mexico, Central America, north Africa and the Middle East. The snake that Cueball finds might be a {{w|Anguis fragilis|slow-worm}}, a limbless reptile native to Eurasia. It's shiny, brown, has a blunt head, and can shed its tail like a lizard, which might give it a half-finished look if Cueball saw it that way. But a stronger contender is the {{w|rubber boa}}, which is native to the western US, and has a famously stubby head and tail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This makes me think of one area: The {{w|Great Salt Lake}}. The {{w|Bear River (Utah)|Bear River}} empties into it from a northerly direction, and the area has the rubber boa and at least one type of poisonous horned snake. Native Americans of the area even had legends of the Horned Serpent. And that ''had'' to be a teepee we saw earlier. (I don't think Native Americans had trebuchets or berets, though....) --[[User:Druid816|Druid816]] ([[User talk:Druid816|talk]]) 01:59, 2 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

We can see some chicks at the end of his walk at images 1374-1376 [http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/?frame=1375&amp;amp;framediff=1374].

Take a closer look; there's some kind of wisp hanging out in some of the empty frames and the ones Megan's looking back in. It's only about a pixel wide, but a few long; broken up, serpentine, almost ethereal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the hut scene (June 20) there seems to be something large moving in the bushes next to the fence. There was also something something poking in on the left back by the cairn (a few frames back). [[Special:Contributions/216.239.45.91|216.239.45.91]] 18:18, 20 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

:I've been mapping the journey from the start, piecing each segment end-to-end in Photoshop. There is no significant net elevation change until they started following the river. The net elevation change from image #1150 to now (#1818) is 1402 pixels = 210.2 feet (assuming a 40 px average height of Cueball and using 40 px = 6 feet). However, since this is a comic, one may assume a greater height than that actually depicted. The horizontal distance along the same river walk is 59516 pixels = 8927.4 feet (1.7 mi, 2.7 km). I don't have the distances along the sea. The average speed, using 1 hr/frame update, is 0.0025 mph, 0.0041 kph (at 5 min/frame update the speed increases to 0.0304 mph).

:- thanks to [[User:Galois|Galois]] we do know they did climb approx. 65 meters (maybe slightly more because 6 feet or 1.8288 meters for Cueball is maybe a little bit too much).&lt;br /&gt;
:- they are still in real nature, the most technical devices we have seen is just wood.&lt;br /&gt;
:- but they also did cross a road at the beginning of their travel.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I'd like to think Cueball is shorter, I used 6 ft because it's convenient and yields longer distances. The tallest Baobob tree is 516 px (rescaled to the running comic) = 77.4 ft (23.6 m) using a 6 ft Cueball. Note that using a 5.5 ft (1.7 m) Cueball, the tree drops to 71 ft (21.6 m). The Wikipedia page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia_grandidieri] on the Grandidier's baobab states they can reach 25 to 30 m (80-100 ft) in height, 23.6 m is about right.

I don't follow this as religously as others so maybe I missed the obvious answer, but why is it assumed that we have seen all of the way they went? I alway thought the parts where they are hiking is like a &amp;quot;montage&amp;quot; in film, where lots of parts might be missing in between the snapshots we see. {{unsigned|193.171.69.65|05:58, 6 June 2013}}&lt;br /&gt;

(please sign your posts - don't worry, we're all here out of a mutual enjoyment of the xkcd comics) Actually, I looked into the possibility a while back, but it didn't work. Randall runs 3-5 frame updates with the two walking across the same panel. As they leave one panel on the right, they enter the next on the left (and visa-verse for the trip back to the sunken castle). Additionally, I only came across three panels that didn't adjoin perfectly (one in the sand dunes and two trees that didn't continue into the next panel).

== Philosophical implications ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think the huge following that this comic has gathered - the amount of work by people like Aubron Wood and the guys at geekwagon, explainxkcd editors, general xkcd enthusiasts, the people at XKCD time wiki - raises some interesting questions. At this point we're not even clear how Randall is writing these comics: he may have designed them all from the start, or he may be writing 24 a day, going along with it, according to the natural progression of events and what has led up to now. It has interesting parallels with the {{w|design argument}}. It also makes you wonder about how it's all going to end. There are so many ongoing discussions - and have been from the start - about how the comic is going to conclude. Just as in real life we take so many different roads and never really know where we're going to end up. If we're continuing with the religious theme we could extend the metaphor even further, about what happens after we die. We don't know if we're going to just stop existing or if we're going to end up in some elaborate afterlife. We don't know what Randall's going to do - how long will the comic go on? Could it last his entire lifetime? We have no way of knowing. --[[User:Mynotoar|Mynotoar]] ([[User talk:Mynotoar|talk]]) 14:05, 8 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I believe Randall is writing this as it goes along, preparing the scenes only a little bit in advance. The story (quest?) reads more like a series of isolated vignettes, but with a few themes being carried forward, such as the quest for the source of the rising sea. I'm here in homage to Randall's unique wit and humor, and having fun trying to second guess what he'll do next. I don't believe the setting is an actual place, but we have several clues that limit its location. I see this as a collection of disparate objects and events; some go together, some not, but with some running themes. Randall may be making some points (such as conservation, ecology, and not eating squirrels); although, I would have never filled a canteen from the small river without first boiling or purifying the water.

&lt;br /&gt;
I'm still not sure that it is supposed to be a specific place, but going with the Madagascar theory, there is indeed a native Madagascar hedgehog -- the greater and lesser tenrecs. &lt;br /&gt;

Still no squirrels, though. [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 20:58, 14 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
:Hedgehogs are found in many places. From the shadow comments, they are on a northern sea coast in the northern hemisphere, hence probably not Madagascar. There's something wrong with every possible location I checked. The Mediterranean Sea is rising because the water coming in from rivers is greater than that lost through evaporation [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea#Sea-level_rise] and is polluted [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea#Pollution], BUT a quick check has every possible northern coast covered with cities or agriculture. I lived in Salt Lake City for a little while. Antelope Island has oolitic sand on the north and west sides and is a mountain, but no major rivers or waterfalls[http://www.utah.com/stateparks/great_salt_lake_facts.htm]. The north coast is a boggy delta, except for a peninsula, which is covered with agriculture. Southern Utah is a better match and has waterfalls, but no sea. I gave up.

:: The sea thing is certainly a problem for any modern-day Utah theory, but the tree that recently came on-screen (frame 2145) could be intended to be ''Pinus longaeva'', which would be appropriate to Utah (or many other parts of the Great Basin), high altitudes, and the comic theme.  Oh, also, if you want a rising, large body of water near Southern Utah there's always Lake Mead.  But it's probably not so large as to be mistaken for the sea. --Joe Decker&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:: I'm not sure that current agriculture would be an issue. Unless they are play-acting or in some kind of _The Village_ setup, they seem unlikely to be current-day humans. They seem strangely ignorant of some obvious things and yet aware of others. There might be a few tribal peoples living in tents that would be unaware of the next river over, but they would be unlikely to be confused by birds nesting. Or be using trebuchets and European castle architecture in sandcastles. And if they genuinely walked for &amp;quot;days&amp;quot; along the shore, it seems unlikely to be a _The Village_ setup; that's got to be 20 miles even taking a leisurely trip for just two days, and probably more.

The rounded slice at the top matches Megan's head as well. The full slice does not match any scene to date (the only one close is 1885 with Megan in the tree, but that's not it); thus, it must be a slice from a future scene (or maybe part of a template with assorted characters).

And if we have that, the relative position of the sun to the stars should be sufficient to determine the day of the year (depending on the accuracy of the drawings) and probably, assuming the first bright dot was indeed Venus, we might even be able to determine if the story takes/took place this year.

:From the position of the sun, Venus is at or close to greatest eastern elongation from the sun.  Assuming that the constellations we are looking at are Sagittarius and surroundings (and the new stars coming into view continue to match this), the sun is located around Virgo.  From the angle of the ecliptic, they are at 30 degrees north, and thus it would have to be around the beginning of November, as that's when Virgo sets with the sun at 30N. So it could be a year when Venus hits the greatest eastern elongation in late October/early November.  Which happens this year, but it can't be this year as the moon isn't right -- there would be a crescent moon next to Venus. It would have to be at new moon or waning moon, and that puts it after 2037. Of course, there are a lot of assumptions and estimations in that calculation. [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 02:29, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
::Actually, for the moon it could be 2029, but there's another blocking factor: Mars should be next to Venus in 2037.  And for the next few eight year cycles, some combination of Mercury, the moon, and Saturn should be showing up between Venus and the Sun before the stars do. So it looks like 2053 would be the first matching date. And the next date after that 2085 - it precesses forward a bit each year, so it would be Nov 12 by 2085.

I wandered over to the forum, and they agree with our conclusion of Sagittarius, and one of them had a interesting observation: Antares is gone. It should be the brightest thing in this view apart from Venus, and you can see the two stars that should flank it appear here [[http://bit.ly/12tfHNG]], between Cueball's head and the tree, but no Antares.

One last thing (for the moment): The angle of the sun and planets are what they should be for c. 30-33 degrees N, but to get the constellations angled the right way, it's closer to 12 degrees north. This may be precession, which could also explain the grapes in what would be currently by the stars the beginning of November -- the vernal equinox may have precessed forward, resulting in the sun being in Virgo/Libra in summer rather than fall. 15,000 years would put it in Libra in June, for example [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 16:27, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Where in the world are Megan and Cueball? ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Venus marking the path of the ecliptic tells us that we are at about 30 degrees north (my quick-ass calculation came up closer to 31 or 32 degrees north.) They are walking east with the ocean to the south of them, and they are following a large river north into hills and mountains that apparently are less than a day's walk north. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if it's Earth, where could they be? There's not a lot of south-facing coasts around 30N. The only large one is the Gulf Coast of the US, but there's not much in the way of hills much less anything you could call a mountain close to the shore. The only exception I can really see is maybe around Mobile, which at last has some hills. There's the north end of the Persian Gulf and of the Gulf of California, but for both of those the hills are east of of the most obvious large river.  Though the Gulf of California would make sense in other ways -- rivers that only run to the sea in the wet season, for example. There's South Korea, but the southern coast of that is broken up into a fringe of islands and peninsula, there's not really a solid stretch of coast to walk east along.  [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 00:14, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

:If, as hypothesized above, this is taking place a few thousand years into the future, might not the coastlines have changed?  (Especially since the &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; seems to be rising.)  I wonder if we could find the proper configuration of hills and a mountain even in absence of a body of water to the south.

All the stars are following the same parallel path through the sky. Shouldn't the stars should be following a circular path centered on the north star, and the planets if any be following roughly the path of the sun and moon? --deepfatfriar&lt;br /&gt;

So, how far away are we viewing them from? We know (about) how tall Cueball is and the stars give us an angular ruler so we should be able to figure that out. Also, when will sunrise be? [[Special:Contributions/99.72.154.66|99.72.154.66]] 03:54, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Someone mentioned the Clock of the Long Now, and the 10,000 Year Clock would fit in a number of ways.  The Texas original one is at the right latitude, and the Sierra Diablo mountains where it is are near a dried-up inland sea, which presumably could be a sea again, and an inland sea could rise much faster than the world's oceans.  And it would fit with the title &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot;, and explain the multi-thousand year future setting. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Has anyone been able to map exactly where the sun is on the stars? That would show where in the precession sequence we are. If it's in Libra, for example 15,000 years forward the sun would set in Libra around June at 31-32 degrees north at that point.  Which would explain the grapes and the camping without shelter.

==If the night does map the real world...==&lt;br /&gt;
If the stars are real I'm sure it still does map to the current time frame of this comic. Venus and also Jupiter (even also Mercury, but hard to see) did follow the sun at dawn. Tomorrow I will have to fix my (Linux) xOrg for running {{w|Stellarium (computer program)|Stellarium}} or {{w|Celestia}}.

:I've made a compare of the changes in Scorpio over the next 15K years, and the sky in Time. [http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/7/77/starsmove.png].  It matches pretty well, though I think the fastest moving star hasn't moved quite as far.  So my current prediction: they are in the Sierra Diablo mountains in Texas (or what was Texas), climbing towards the 10,000 Year Clock observatory, about 14,000 years from now.

The picture does chance with time. The URL includes a changing timestamp that I can't decipher. Compare these two URLS (which have slightly different images:&lt;br /&gt;

Perhaps there is a way to hack the URL to view future images. [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:29, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I would also like to add that knowing randall, these are not the only images. For all we know, the image will still be changing in 5 years while a tree grows in front of them. My point is: Are the URLs hackable, or did he encrypt them? [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:33, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Likely there is a way to hack the URLs; they look like some sort of hash, probably a hashed timestamp. Of course, he could easily have added some salt to the hash, making it significantly *harder* to hack. But they're strings of a specific length, so it should be pretty easy to bruteforce it, fetch all the images, and then (maybe) reverse-engineer the sequence. *That* all depends on how many of them there are.

: Given that the images switch back and forth between other images already seen, and that the comic should be viewable in the future, it seems unlikely that it's any thing like a simple sha256 of part of the timestamp.  I think it's more likely a function of half-hours and minutes (assuming we continue to get a new possible image every half-hour).

::: The images do cycle, yes. But for some reason I have never seen the img where Megan is looking behind her. Also wouldn't it be difficult to show a sequential story (like the rising tide) if the previous images keep cycling ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hash appears to be SHA-256. I tried some obvious hashes (&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;11901&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190_1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190.1&amp;quot;) to no avail. Maybe this is HMAC-SHA256? Also, I would suggest trying Unix timestamps. [[Special:Contributions/131.156.236.149|131.156.236.149]] 06:19, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I've been trying to make educated guesses as to what's being hashed here: http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator ... he could also be using hash(hash2(value)) which would be virtually impossible to crack.

&lt;br /&gt;
It's entirely possible that the &amp;quot;hash&amp;quot; is actually randomly generated. Just a thought. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.119.153|129.21.119.153]] 07:03, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regarding sha256. Its most likely some hash of a timestamp, but if he doesnt wants us to crack it, he would have prefixes a password.. sha256('secretcode17:30'). Im just saying, if he doesnt wants us to crack it, we most likely cant.&lt;br /&gt;
I've tested all unixtimestamps from 1300000000 to 1364390334. Also &amp;quot;00:00&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;23:59&amp;quot;, with and without the colon and a load of other formats. {{unsigned|77.243.128.133}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alright, this is probably not going to work, but I'm trying to exploit Randall's awesomeness here. Maybe he decided to take the time-stamps from the user? I don't know if that's even possible... That would then allow people in different time zones to obtain different images simultaneously. (What's the corollary of Godwin's law for a bunch of math-and-science nerds and relativity? Is there one?) Clicking the img src url on the comic's html page, give me this: http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/752687b61523144c61736cd89f8c153dc41e19128f72d78d44947ff800f057fa.png : Never mind.. apparently others see the same image too.&lt;br /&gt;

::::: The script seems to poll the server every minute or two. It's different from before, where the image server itself redirected to the correct image. The auto refresh was probably always intended, but not quite ready when the comic went live. It may have turned out to be necessary too, so the image server doesn't have to do all the work.

Is it just me or or did Randall manage to make all of us perform a Denial of Service on xkcd.com, and explainxkcd.com ? xkcd.com seems much slower, and I keep getting &amp;quot;500 Internal server error&amp;quot; when accessing this site (explainxkcd.com). I guess that's the effect of having everybody hit F5 every few minutes :) [[Special:Contributions/193.239.192.194|193.239.192.194]] 11:57, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Earlier today, the server handled all the image redirections. The script you see above went through several mutations (currently at #8), with each mutation it seems that Randall is adding more servers and trying to split the load between them. This is basically how a bot-net works - we all run code written by some evil genius, and he's changing the code as time passes to serve some hidden purpose.&lt;br /&gt;

When I saw this comic last night and that there was no explanation up, I thought to myself &amp;quot;How zen.&amp;quot;  I figured that Randall was going through a calm streak before throwing us the utterly ridiculous April 1st comic.

For those wondering about the Javascript behind this: I posted my analysis of the Javascript [http://www.echochamber.me/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=101043&amp;amp;start=760#p3303579 on the xkcd forums], and further de-obfuscated and annotated the code over on [https://gist.github.com/cincodenada/5246094 GitHub].  Here's a quick summary though: it holds open a connection to xkcd's servers and listens for instructions and follows them. Those instructions are either &amp;quot;load a new image&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;reload the page&amp;quot;. So, you don't have to mash F5, it will automatically update the image when they're available. We have no way to control how fast the images come or when they do, and it's quite possible for them to update forever. --[[User:Fiveofoh|Fiveofoh]] ([[User talk:Fiveofoh|talk]]) 06:41, 27 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

This is a series of animation frames. I suspect they will only ever be shown once (based on the fact you can only get the current image, not previous or future images -- this is in keeping with the title, &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot;, which passes and which you can't ever get back].

Call me a paranoid, but I think this strip is all about 9/11:&lt;br /&gt;
*If you read the strip number (1190) backwards, you get 09/11&lt;br /&gt;
*This subject is recurrent on xkcd&lt;br /&gt;
*As far as we have seen, there is a destroyed tower and they are rebuilding it&lt;br /&gt;
*The next strip, following 1190 (or 09/11), mentions war against countries with large oil reserves but low military capacity. {{unsigned|143.107.105.14}}&lt;br /&gt;
:I feel like that's kind of a stretch, I'm pretty sure it's just a story about a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If a new strip goes up every 30 minutes our time, and if each strip comprises of, let's say for the sake of simplicity, one minute in their time; to build the sand castle [frames 24-117 = 93 frames] so far it's taken almost 2 days our time, which would be about an hour and a half their time if each frame is a minute.  Using my scale, an hour our time is 2 minutes their time, a day is 48 minutes, and our month is their 24 hour day.  If we assume Randall plans to give us a 24 hour period from that world's time, and we use the minute-per-frame rate I made up, than we'd probably be looking at a month of images our time.  I guess we'll just have to see how long he's got it planned to go on. -boB&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Has it ended? All that's left is the sandcastle, and there doesn't seem to have been anything else changed on it for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's zooming out! When look at the gifs showing the frames in succession, the last 3 show the castle getting slightly smaller each time!&lt;br /&gt;
: It's true! The most recent also shows the edge of another castle, leading me to believe it's part of some kind of sand castle contest, probably including some of xkcd's other recurring characters!&lt;br /&gt;

Strange: As far as I know http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time.png always redirects to the current frame. But if you visit the current one (133:00) at http://xkcd.com/1190/ and check the displayed image, it says 'c6976fbb244af4fc2286ffe3ac2cf78d408c1f610ecd71e18b4a677a048f084d.png' while time.png redirects to '1d9ce7199935b1b629d6b8744e62c7700a3780357b2dc74bb70471db616ddadb.png'.

I'm seeing some strange stuff now. I have a script that uses wget of time.png to get the redirected hash png like Lockyy is doing. And I can verify that when you go to the 1190 page in the browser you get a different hash. But the previous hour and this hour, unlike the ones before it, the two hash pngs are different. And when I refresh the screen in my browser at the 1190 page, first I see the image I get from time.png, then the image refreshes with the other one. I'm not sure what this means or what we are supposed to do with it. I added the time.png hashes to the table for the last two hours but we probably need a way of indicating the difference. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 20:38, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: This latest hourly update did the same thing. If you are fast enough you can even get the first image in your browser by right click view image before it changes to the second one.

: Looking at it some more, I see that wget of the page at xkcd.com/1190/ gets you an img link to time.png and then there is the javascript that must after some delay get the different hash url image. That means that we had better be sure that we do not miss any manual checks of hourly updates because the scripts will never find that second image unless someone has a way of getting a script that runs the javascript as if it was a browser. As long as someone posts the hash of the image from the browser every hour, I can ensure that we have the hashes the scripts can get because I have a cron job checking for those updates every 15 minutes. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 21:49, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

When Megan coughed and Cueball asked if she was okay, did anyone else think of http://xkcd.com/931/ Lanes? Cueball explains that cancer treatment results are not known until much later, &amp;quot;and often the first sign is a cough or a bone pain.  So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry . . . .&amp;quot; ~~wrybred&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:I don't want to be a downer but this is just my interpretation thus far. I hope it is a happier theme but if you are correct wrybred, my further explanation would be the following... I think that building sandcastles is an analogy for living their life. Going for a swim in the body of water and the cough could represent the start of the cancer or possibly some time where they had to go out and &amp;quot;wade&amp;quot; in the possibilities of what cancer could mean. Time passes and Cueball says &amp;quot;I don't think we can build it much taller than this. It's been fun, though&amp;quot; which represents that they believe they have done as well as they can with the lives they have been given. They comment on the river retreating even though we the audience observe a body of water on the right hand side rising could represent how we can be fooled into believing things are going alright when in reality they are not. The reference to not understanding what the river is doing also fits this explanation well as someone with cancer may occasionally feel confused about their illness. Presently while I write this they are possibly preparing for a flood which represents the return of the cancer. If I were to guess what is next I might guess that they will watch as the flood comes in and destroys some of what they built but it is better than not having made the sandcastle in the first place. I could be way off, but Randall has given us a lot of TIME to think about what this is all about and your mind wanders. I also would note that this may not be about a particular cancer story, just any cancer story. [[User:Nhoel|Nhoel]] ([[User talk:Nhoel|talk]]) 13:51, 8 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

In the frame-by-frame breakdown, the &amp;quot;Image&amp;quot; field simply gives the time in hours, while the &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; field gives the time in days+hours.  It would be helpful if the &amp;quot;Image&amp;quot; field instead gave an ordinal number indicating the number of frames (e.g., this would help to correlate the Transcript on this page with the frame numbers [http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/ here].  The current &amp;quot;Image&amp;quot; field need not be deleted (I personally prefer time in hours to time in days+hours), but it might be relabeled as &amp;quot;Time in Hours&amp;quot;.  Implementing this would require some use of scripts, and would be best if adopted by the person updating the frame-by-frame breakdown in the first place.

When the server had a problem one image was 100 minutes late, and another was 50 minutes late. Because of this there was a file between time682 and time683 that wasn't posted here (time683 should have been time684), and many files after that are displayed here an hour before they should have been displayed, with the wrong filename. It also affects xkcd-time.wikia.com as I had got many of the files on there from here. I am currently trying to correct this.

I'm guessing that the water will keep rising indefinitely, and we'll be left with an upward-moving strip that occasionally zooms out as the bottom layers are very slowly filled in with black &amp;quot;water.&amp;quot; One thing that would make this interesting is the varying heights of the constructed structures (sandcastle turrets, platform, etc.) which would make the process of &amp;quot;overflow&amp;quot; from the right-hand side interesting to watch. {{unsigned ip|65.96.75.37}}&lt;br /&gt;

Oh the symbolism of it: Cueball leaves, Megan finishes building their castle, rests and lets her guard down. The next thing to happen is, a cute girl walks in, sees what the two have built together and leaves. The very next frame, the castle starts to fall apart. [[Special:Contributions/217.81.90.198|217.81.90.198]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm expecting the lower level-castle to be swept away by the water, while the high-level castle will remain intact. This is quite reasonable, assuming Cueball and Megan knows how high the flood will come and thus they built the platform to an appropriate height. It may be interpreted as the lower-level castle being the work of our life, which is inevitable finite, and will be eventually overtaken by death. Recognizing this, some choose to build a castle for the &amp;quot;after-life&amp;quot;. Life-death reflections have been common on xkcd in the past as well. {{unsigned ip|149.241.18.229}}&lt;br /&gt;

For me, this is clearly about cancer and the impacts it has on a relationship over time. Randall's now wife was diagnosed and treated for cancer recently and through this comic, he's trying to portray the anxious wait they faced through treatment and remission.  He has put us into his shoes by keeping us waiting in suspense to see how things end up.  The passing of time represents their life together.  At first it's just them relaxing together, probably the dating phase.  Soon they start building a life together, represented by the sand castle.  The castle evolves over time, much like their life has.  Difficulties and gaffes in their relationship are depicted, for example when cueball trips and breaks down part of the wall.  Eventually all efforts are diverted and put into defending against the approaching sea, which represents the cancer.  The wall, the platform, all represent the steps taken to prevent and/or prepare for it's impending progress.  The river represents the cure for cancer, which is still pretty far out, as cueball mentioned.  There are many many more clues I see and explanations I can give to support this idea (castle in the sky, the rain, progress with research, etc.), but this is just starting point.  I'm excited to see where the comic will end up, but I guess we just need to &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;.  --[[User:Nick|Nick]] ([[User talk:Nick|talk]]) 21:25, 24 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

The cancer metaphors are quite intriguing, but my take is environmental, possibly pollution and global warming. The French girl (beret) could be a nod to the Disneyland Paris castle.

I'm taking it that &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; is a phonetic substitute for &amp;quot;c,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;meaning &amp;quot;cancer.&amp;quot;  For better or worse, this kind of phoenetic clue was used in the Batman movie:&lt;br /&gt;

Well, I don't know if the intention here is that the &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; is making the &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; grow.  My point is that the dialogue is so nonsensical at points that it seems to be code.  I'm taking every noun as a metaphor for something.  &amp;quot;Sea&amp;quot; being &amp;quot;cancer&amp;quot; seems to fit (&amp;quot;The cancer can't make more of itself forever, can it?&amp;quot;)  I guess go back through the dialogue and see what other words could substitute for what they're saying.  Like I said, I don't know what &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;rain&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ground&amp;quot; could be in this metaphor.

I agree - the water has started eroding the castle to the right, and it makes sense for the erosion to potentially loop the comic back to frame 1. That said, the title text was &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;. This could be a euphamism suggesting &amp;quot;keep waiting, this comic changes&amp;quot;, but it does have an implication that there is a &amp;quot;finale&amp;quot; to the comic that you should wait for.

The most recent event is Megan walking in, saying &amp;quot;bye!&amp;quot; in *lower case*, and leaving.  From the lower case, which is different from the rest of the comic, I infer that she was talking to *us*, not (eg) herself or the sandcastle!  I reckon it's just going to fill up with water until the page is a static black rectangle. Especially since she and Cueball just talked about going off and exploring, grabbed their bags, and left. -cosmogoblin [[Special:Contributions/94.197.127.235|94.197.127.235]] 13:57, 26 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Just wanted to say: I don't think the beret girl is a girl at all. It's a boy with an old-fashioned navy-style cap. Popular with boys at the beach (in the old days). See images here (http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x130/JTMarcus/h1.jpg) and here (http://cabinetcardgallery.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/kidwithcap_0003.jpg) I also like the fact that, just before the castle completely fades away, you can barely see the little boy bringing more materials (maybe another support beam?) to continue the work.&lt;br /&gt;
I like the continuity of letting the beret boy (not girl)&lt;br /&gt;
: Wether it's a navy cap or not may be open to interpretation (though I'd still bet it's a beret - it surely looks a lot more like the one the beret guy wears, and I think Randall would have put a little more effort into that detail if he wanted it to pass off as a navy cap). As for it being a boy, no. It's definitely a girl, you can clearly see it has a longer hair, and come to think of it, Randall rarely draws any hair at all for male characters anyway. --[[Special:Contributions/201.53.213.201|201.53.213.201]] 23:36, 29 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

During the last glacial period the sea level was more than 100 meters lower than it is nowadays, so coastal structures looked very different and the continents exposed much more land. I believe the first act of this comic references medieval ages in Europe where people would witness (over the scope of hundreds of years or longer) losing land and coastal towns to the sea but not understanding the process, as Megan states. I'm expecting the second act, and possibly further acts, to reference the abundance of scientifical discoveries made during the last few centuries.

Well, they've made it back to the beach.  I think it will end either at 1000 or 1024, and the only reason it might go to 1024 is allow some dialog and zooming in. :-)  --[[User:Divad27182|Divad27182]] ([[User talk:Divad27182|talk]]) 18:01, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I thought that too initially - the terrain features certainly seems identical (to scale) to the one at the start of the story. But something's bothering me; it's about the frame before we see they are back on a beach - they are already seated, so it's fair to assume they haven't moved, yet the terrain is different. By looking at the terrain, you could guess that maybe the terrain is inverted, which would then indicate that the frame with the beach in view is from a different angle than the previous frame. But for that to be the case, Cueball would have to be behind Megan on the previous frame, yet, their positions are unchanged on these frames. So, I don't know...

Wait, what? It looks like they are suddenly back at a beach that looks the same as the first one, just zoomed out. But before when the scene was presumably inverted, the terrain didn't look quite like that. If the scene really did get inverted, maybe they aren't actually on a beach right now, but the sea will eventually expand until it reaches them. Then again, we don't know if this is the same plane of space that the original beach was either. They were just walking to the right. The concept of space in this comic is confusing me right now. I wonder if this will make sense later. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.63.158|129.21.63.158]] 18:41, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

It appears that the camera perspective has changed. 1 - 970 are all perpendicular to the shoreline, with the water on the right, camera looking down the shore. 971-996 are shown parallel to the shore line, with the camera position apparently out over the water or standing at the shore, looking back toward land. (If the camera had maintained the original position, the characters would have simply gotten smaller as the walked away, but instead we got to see the walk across the frame while presumably following the shore.) In 997, the camera perspective just comes back around to be a profile shot again, looking down the shoreline, water once again on the right. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.183.156.9|65.183.156.9]] 19:40, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

...And there we got as far as frame 1190, which several people have called as the end, and the story does not appear to be resolved at all. How long can this go on? --Therrufying [[Special:Contributions/83.233.5.126|83.233.5.126]] 17:07, 8 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Okay, so it didn't end with 1190.  Must have misread the prophecies. [[Special:Contributions/66.38.57.117|66.38.57.117]] 00:51, 9 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;How long can this go on?  I would say a very long time.  Currently, each day is filled mostly with a very few backgrounds used over several comics with only the characters moving -- not that difficult to produce -- and maybe a few lines of dialog, which also allows for the repetition of the background.  He can probably keep this pace for months.  It would be a bit disappointing, but possible.  The strip certainly doesn't seem to be approaching any sort of conclusion.  But, I think, like certain kinds of art, its the presentation that important.  And he is presenting Time.  -Tom A. &amp;quot;Time is a local condition.&amp;quot; - wish I could remember who said that.

&lt;br /&gt;
969:00 41/09:00 f8a6414c334a71481e16428691fe8465098b2bae956e44727d0482c7632a84ff.png &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I'm getting ...a84ff from http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time.png, but the main http://xkcd.com/1190/ gives the current image. [[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 23:43, 4 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Has anyone noticed that the exact same identical image was re-used several times recently? If you go to http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/ and tell it to show differences from frame 1090, and then start clicking forward, the following frames are all exactly the same: 1094, 1097, 1101, 1103, 1107. Looking at http://xkcd.aubronwood.com/# you can then see that 1111 and 1113 are also the same. The rapid perspective change makes the animation appear to strobe. Could this be some strange attempt to illustrate something like an earthquake, or are they just re-using frames to avoid having to draw so many?

== Hours ==&lt;br /&gt;
There seems to be a problem starting with today (Sunday, 2013-05-05): The first picture should be 984:00 and not 983:00. I'm not able to check if it's simply a bot (?) error writing down the hours or something more serious. --[[Special:Contributions/82.135.84.245|82.135.84.245]] 15:56, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Hour 983 on image 1104 Saturday (23:00 UTC) also appears on image 1105 Sunday (00:00 UTC). The image numbers are correct, but the hour count appears to be off by 1 hour now.[[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 16:34, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Not all images do map to the hash ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I did run this great command posted here before on 13 April 2013:&lt;br /&gt;
 md5sum -b * | sort | uniq -w32 -D&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then I did rename all duplicates to image???_.png. After that I did download the hashes from here to image???.png and run the check again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First result is easy. Files are changed so md5sum for image002_ and image002 are different but content is the same. But 004 is wrong and I will update this one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 878341ab1f710e5832aa7ed5cfa66ed7 *image002_.png&lt;br /&gt;
 878341ab1f710e5832aa7ed5cfa66ed7 *image004_.png&lt;br /&gt;

Next duplicate is also easy because files are still the same:&lt;br /&gt;

== Split the movie? ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The page is becoming impossible to load.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would suggest to split the movie into pieces, for instance by making a separate sub-page for each week (avoiding embarassing discussion on the most natural cutting point). Each week can have a separate description, seven-seconds animation, list of 7x24 pictures etc, and a link to the following and previous weeks.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
:My only suggestion would be give it larger segments. I don't think it needs to be as small as a week - after all, it loaded fine for a very long time. Maybe approx. half a scene each? Scene 1 is 971 frames long, so how about split at 500, at 971, and again at 1500 (when it gets there)? [[Special:Contributions/24.129.75.17|24.129.75.17]] 08:12, 8 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Here is a possible breackdown structure where sequences are ~130 pictures long : (number of frames / Start frame number))&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Part 1 : Sand Castles&lt;br /&gt;
 (127) 001:  First sand castle&lt;br /&gt;
 (105) 128 : Second sand castle (180) and Catapulte&lt;br /&gt;
 (090) 233 : Joining castles&lt;br /&gt;
 (100) 323 : Miniature castle&lt;br /&gt;
 (116) 423 : Scaffold&lt;br /&gt;
 (131) 539 : Plattform&lt;br /&gt;
 (132) 670 : Fourth castle&lt;br /&gt;
 (173) 802 : Sea rising &amp;amp; fade out&lt;br /&gt;
Part 2 : Wildernesses&lt;br /&gt;
 (150) 975 : Seashore&lt;br /&gt;
 (100) 1125 : Rivershore&lt;br /&gt;
 (115) 1225 – : Hills&lt;br /&gt;
 (087) 1340 - 1363 – 1379 : Trees&lt;br /&gt;
 (124) 1427 : Baobabs&lt;br /&gt;
 1551 – 1581 Berries&lt;br /&gt;
 1619 – Squirrel&lt;br /&gt;
 1640 Berries&lt;br /&gt;
Suggestions that can be discussed :&lt;br /&gt;
* Sequences should be 100-150 pictures long (with possible exceptions).&lt;br /&gt;
* Even if the image is not that big, the length of the movie can be a problem when one wants to check for details : short sequences allow for a slower pace.&lt;br /&gt;
* Good cutting points would be : two consecutive identical pictures, changes of scenery. Sequences with the same theme should on the contrary be kept together when possible.&lt;br /&gt;

:This is not real life. And they know it's not real life. Maybe they are in some sort of Matrix and know about it, or they are playing a video game. They've seen in developers' blog that devs are working on a lot of new features for version 0.19, such as improved sand physics, multiple rivers, rain, salty water, trebuchets, swimming, surf, etc. But then developers decided to release part of these features in version 0.19, and leave the rest for 0.20. When Cueball an Megan saw that version 0.19 is out, they immediately decided to try it out, without even looking at the changelog. So they don't know which features made it into this version, and which ones will be in the next one. So far they have played around with new sand physics and trebuchets, tried swimming in the sea, tried to drink sea water, found a new river. They haven't seen any surf, so they think it'll be in 0.20. They have yet to try swimming in a river, or see the rain. They have also found a bug that causes sea level to raise indefinitely. They think it could be caused either by rain, additional rivers, or just by a griefer who built a giant sand generator array to fill in the sea and flood everything. Oh, and they can't just create a new private world to see if the sea raises there, because of the DRM.&lt;br /&gt;

Swimming in a river is dangerous if there's a strong current. Even slow moving water has a lot of power. The sea could be the ocean, connected to the ocean, or one of the large bodies of water referred to as a sea.

We know: &amp;quot;The sea is big&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The river is small&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But we also know about the sea: There are no waves. It's just rising. So it is not an ocean, it's just a lake. Many people say &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; to a lake when they can not see the other side.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And we know their home river is small. But right now they explore a different bigger river.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We know it's not summer so maybe it is spring and the river is rising like every year?&lt;br /&gt;

It seems like the two river halves (or two rivers) merge as Megan and Cueball hike upstream. New point: I joined all the images covering their journey since image 1150 (last stop for water). it spans 18204 pixels. Assuming Cueball is 6 feet tall (wild guess + it's an even number), they have now hiked a total of 0.517 miles (83228.7 cm) from image 1150.[[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 13:32, 10 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Considering the elaborate and fragile sand castles, the one- and two-person construction of the platform and its castle components, and maybe the latest antics at the top of the dunes, it appears that gravity is not Earth-normal.

&lt;br /&gt;
Since this 1190 will never end, will it? I think we need some archive sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First could be &amp;quot;1190 Time Images 2013-03 March&amp;quot; (&amp;lt;- I am calling this human readable ISO)&lt;br /&gt;
So, if you understand, each month of picture links and hashes on a separate page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next would be &amp;quot;1190 Time Images 2013-04 April&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

:::::::I wasn't shouting, there is no need to bring ad hominem into this discussion.

Each solution will lead to degradation of the explanation, splitting the article will force multiple page loads while removing the hash values will be destroying part of the metadata around the comic. Ideally, we wouldn't have to make the split at all, but speed considerations mean that we eventually will have to do it. In that eventuality, all we can do is the thing that degrades the explanation for the average visitor the least. What do visitors care more about, faster load times/having all the frames on one page or having 1000-odd incomprehensible and meaningless hash values? We don't display the individual filenames for Click and Drag even though they were more informative than the hashes here, because they hold little value to visitors; they only take up space that could be used to further enhance the explanation.

So Cueball and Megan seem to entering a region with much more vegetation. Up until now I had assumed that the previous regions had vegetation as well but Randall just hadn't bothered drawing it (such detail is rare in XKCD). So what does presence of vegetation mean? More rainfall? Higher elevation? Also how far have Cueball and Megan travelled? I don't think the frames are necessarily contiguous - if this was a movie we'd have background music to go with the images. They could have been travelling for days or weeks - I definitely don't think it is still the same day as the start of Act II. I suppose 'time' will tell.

The latest frame (1506) has two trees. They are almost certainly baobab trees. There are 8 species of baobab tree, but of those 8, 6 are endemic to the island of Madagascar, including the species which the trees in the comic most resemble, the Grandidier baobab. Even if they are not one of the six species endemic to Madagascar, the fact that they are baobabs still limits them to the continent of Africa, the countries of Oman and Yemen, and northwestern Australia. This means that the big sea, if it is an ocean, is most likely the Indian Ocean. [[Special:Contributions/76.92.118.150|76.92.118.150]] 18:30, 21 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Big trees ==&lt;br /&gt;
A great guy at the xkcd forum did identify the big trees starting at frame 1503 (1382:00 hours). They belong to Madagascar and their name is {{w|Adansonia grandidieri}}. But also a few of them do exist in the US. So I am still not sure where we are.--[[User:Dgbrt|Dgbrt]] ([[User talk:Dgbrt|talk]]) 18:11, 23 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

::&amp;quot;Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces...&amp;quot;  [[Special:Contributions/69.123.166.176|69.123.166.176]] 00:20, 24 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
== A hypothesis ==&lt;br /&gt;
Randall's animation is taking place in a distant, post-collapse future (&amp;quot;distant&amp;quot; is relative, here-- say sometime in the next few hundred years, though possibly much further): human civilization is back at a late-Iron Age stage of development, though maybe with slightly more sophisticated metallurgy. The reasons I suggest this are: 1) rising sea-level that is on-going, 2) they can work wood and they have agriculture, 3) they have shown no awareness of any more &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; technology, 4) yet they have no qualms about wandering off into the wilderness without what most of us would consider adequate protection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The one reason I might think it's farther into the future is the bit with the trees. I can't decide if their shape is a consequence of evolution (convergent, so that they are very similar to the {{w|Adansonia grandidieri}}), or they were transplanted (presumably to somewhere south? Higher altitude? Both? Antarctica?). Evolution would imply deeper in the future, and transplantation could be sooner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm really interested to see what the truth is, because it's got me thinking along all kinds of planes.[[Special:Contributions/184.99.231.23|184.99.231.23]] 21:38, 24 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

New clue, image 1692 - &amp;quot;Still, it's better than when we were following the sea, walking straight into the sun all morning.&amp;quot; Walking east along the sea, it places them on the south side of anything.

&lt;br /&gt;
This may be more speculation than not, but the two turned north to follow the river and are now walking on a heading somewhere between NE and NW, which puts them in the northern hemisphere if they can see their shadow in front of them. This is also confusing since there aren't many Grandidier's Baobab trees there [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia_grandidieri].[[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 20:46, 29 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I agree that these orientations are plausible from the dialog in the strip, but remember, we're already pretty certain that they're not in the same universe as us, so we may not be able to assume that the sun rises in the east. There's no evidence to demonstrate that their world rotates west-to-east like ours does, but there's no evidence that it doesn't, either. Let's at least remember the possibility that all of these directions are reversed from what our current theory states.

== The Planting People ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what do we know about them? They've been gone a while, long enough for Cueball to believe it was fine to take grapes.  But they haven't been gone for a long time, because we've seen a staked sapling that is likely only a year or two old. They have vineyards and what look to be orchards. They appear to use tents, at least the frame we saw looked to be tied together at the top to form a teepee frame. They are sophisticated enough to do things like put benches next to trees, so they aren't subsistence farmers. Anything else? [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 18:14, 28 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: Forgot a couple of things, they have what is possibly writing (are Cueball and Megan illiterate?), and it's different than that of the Hill People, but their debris appears to look the same.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They appear to be either hunter-gatherers or have abandoned the area (for some reason - why?). From [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomadic] &amp;quot;Many groups of 'nomadic' hunter-gatherers (also known as foragers) moved from campsite to campsite, following game and wild fruits and vegetables.&amp;quot; We have seen three campsites; Cueball burried the embers from their fire (see image 1048 &amp;amp; 1062-1064 [http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/?frame=1064]).

&lt;br /&gt;
:I did wonder about some kind of seasonal movement, but if so it's odd that they left the teepee to collapse (and be damaged, one of the supports is visibly cracked) rather than taking the materials with them or storing them more neatly.

Go to a vineyard in late summer or early autumn, you will not see the &amp;quot;The Planting People&amp;quot;. We only know that we are at this particular season because they can eat grapes from that plants and before they could swim in the sea. And both are following the sun in the morning, witch does mean they are walking East. --[[User:Dgbrt|Dgbrt]] ([[User talk:Dgbrt|talk]]) 19:28, 29 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
== What do we know by the end of May 2013? ==&lt;br /&gt;
I'm trying to collect some facts:&lt;br /&gt;
:-They did build a sand castle and the weather was warm enough to swim in the sea. The taste of the water is bad, and the sea is raising.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Then both are trying to find a reason for that raise and they are starting to travel around this special river.&lt;br /&gt;
:-They are still going uphill while we never have seen that mountains.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Eating grapes from a vineyard means we are at least at late summer.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Walking to the sun in the morning is just walking to the east.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
They are also apparently now heading west, or mostly west.  Their shadows are in front of them, and while that could be west in the morning or east in the evening, they are contrasting it with walking into the sun in the morning as they were along the shore, so it's west. Presumably they were walking mostly north until the decision to head for the mountains, since Cueball has just started playing with his shadow. [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 00:50, 30 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:OK, but they are walking to the sun in the morning. That's east (on northern hemisphere, I still do not think we are at Madagascar). So we do have an other fact:&lt;br /&gt;
:-Around time frame 1700 it's evening.&lt;br /&gt;
--[[User:Dgbrt|Dgbrt]] ([[User talk:Dgbrt|talk]]) 17:07, 30 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:-If you walk into the sun, you are walking east.&lt;br /&gt;
:-They then turned to their left to go upriver. That's would be going north.&lt;br /&gt;
:-If you are above the tropics, your shadow will always lay to the north of you.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Megan says what they're doing is better than when they had to walk into the sun, and it's been established that they walked along the sea for days, so they'd be familiar with walking with the sun directly behind them, too. If they were now walking west, it would pretty much be the same situation, except reversed. It doesn't really make sense to me that she'd call one situation better than the other. It feels more like they aren't walking into the sun ''at all'' anymore. Therefore, I think they are now keeping the sun relatively behind them by going north, which indicates they are north of the equator, and probably north of the Tropic of Cancer. Even at noon, the sun would be behind you slightly, to the south. And if you're walking uphill, it would be very visible to you.&lt;br /&gt;

== Snake Theories ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Megan mentions snakes with spikes over their eyes. That covers several species, all poisonous, but they are native to the American west and southwest, Mexico, Central America, north Africa and the Middle East. The snake that Cueball finds might be a {{w|Anguis fragilis|slow-worm}}, a limbless reptile native to Eurasia. It's shiny, brown, has a blunt head, and can shed its tail like a lizard, which might give it a half-finished look if Cueball saw it that way. But a stronger contender is the {{w|rubber boa}}, which is native to the western US, and has a famously stubby head and tail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This makes me think of one area: The {{w|Great Salt Lake}}. The {{w|Bear River (Utah)|Bear River}} empties into it from a northerly direction, and the area has the rubber boa and at least one type of poisonous horned snake. Native Americans of the area even had legends of the Horned Serpent. And that ''had'' to be a teepee we saw earlier. (I don't think Native Americans had trebuchets or berets, though....) --[[User:Druid816|Druid816]] ([[User talk:Druid816|talk]]) 01:59, 2 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

I'd like to think Cueball is shorter, I used 6 ft because it's convenient and yields longer distances. The tallest Baobob tree is 516 px (rescaled to the running comic) = 77.4 ft (23.6 m) using a 6 ft Cueball. Note that using a 5.5 ft (1.7 m) Cueball, the tree drops to 71 ft (21.6 m). The Wikipedia page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia_grandidieri] on the Grandidier's baobab states they can reach 25 to 30 m (80-100 ft) in height, 23.6 m is about right.

I alway thought the parts where they are hiking is like a &amp;quot;montage&amp;quot; in film, where lots of parts might be missing in between the snapshots we see. {{unsigned|193.171.69.65|05:58, 6 June 2013}}&lt;br /&gt;

(please sign your posts - don't worry, we're all here out of a mutual enjoyment of the xkcd comics) Actually, I looked into the possibility a while back, but it didn't work. Randall runs 3-5 frame updates with the two walking across the same panel. As they leave one panel on the right, they enter the next on the left (and visa-verse for the trip back to the sunken castle). Additionally, I only came across three panels that didn't adjoin perfectly (one in the sand dunes and two trees that didn't continue into the next panel).

Thumbnails are not working at this moment. But nevertheless I think it's not a good idea to include that large pictures. My idea:&lt;br /&gt;
:Create that big pictures, separated into some parts, remove Megan and Cueball and then change only the width to 1200 pixels. And one picture should cover all at the width of 1200 pixels. Scene 2 could be split into several collapsible parts with the terrain picture on top.

OK, apparently it was completely broken at that time.

&lt;br /&gt;
The picture does chance with time. The URL includes a changing timestamp that I can't decipher. Compare these two URLS (which have slightly different images:&lt;br /&gt;
http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/8eb156cce408df8bb83528382d6a2aa2ce6c74f3c573fd12b058cd1c56420672.png&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps there is a way to hack the URL to view future images. [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:29, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I would also like to add that knowing randall, these are not the only images. For all we know, the image will still be changing in 5 years while a tree grows in front of them. My point is: Are the URLs hackable, or did he encrypt them? [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:33, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Likely there is a way to hack the URLs; they look like some sort of hash, probably a hashed timestamp. Of course, he could easily have added some salt to the hash, making it significantly *harder* to hack. But they're strings of a specific length, so it should be pretty easy to bruteforce it, fetch all the images, and then (maybe) reverse-engineer the sequence. *That* all depends on how many of them there are.

It seems that the image is updated every 1/2 hour. [[Special:Contributions/152.23.97.150|152.23.97.150]] 06:17, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: Given that the images switch back and forth between other images already seen, and that the comic should be viewable in the future, it seems unlikely that it's any thing like a simple sha256 of part of the timestamp.  I think it's more likely a function of half-hours and minutes (assuming we continue to get a new possible image every half-hour). [[Special:Contributions/99.153.248.206|99.153.248.206]] 06:59, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

::: The images do cycle, yes. But for some reason I have never seen the img where Megan is looking behind her. Also wouldn't it be difficult to show a sequential story (like the rising tide) if the previous images keep cycling ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hash appears to be SHA-256. I tried some obvious hashes (&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;11901&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190_1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190.1&amp;quot;) to no avail. Maybe this is HMAC-SHA256? Also, I would suggest trying Unix timestamps. [[Special:Contributions/131.156.236.149|131.156.236.149]] 06:19, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I've been trying to make educated guesses as to what's being hashed here: http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator ... he could also be using hash(hash2(value)) which would be virtually impossible to crack.

&lt;br /&gt;
It's entirely possible that the &amp;quot;hash&amp;quot; is actually randomly generated. Just a thought. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.119.153|129.21.119.153]] 07:03, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regarding sha256. Its most likely some hash of a timestamp, but if he doesnt wants us to crack it, he would have prefixes a password.. sha256('secretcode17:30'). Im just saying, if he doesnt wants us to crack it, we most likely cant.&lt;br /&gt;
I've tested all unixtimestamps from 1300000000 to 1364390334. Also &amp;quot;00:00&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;23:59&amp;quot;, with and without the colon and a load of other formats. {{unsigned|77.243.128.133}}&lt;br /&gt;

Alright, this is probably not going to work, but I'm trying to exploit Randall's awesomeness here. Maybe he decided to take the time-stamps from the user? I don't know if that's even possible... That would then allow people in different time zones to obtain different images simultaneously. (What's the corollary of Godwin's law for a bunch of math-and-science nerds and relativity? Is there one?) Clicking the img src url on the comic's html page, give me this: http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/752687b61523144c61736cd89f8c153dc41e19128f72d78d44947ff800f057fa.png : Never mind.. apparently others see the same image too.&lt;br /&gt;

Is it just me or or did Randall manage to make all of us perform a Denial of Service on xkcd.com, and explainxkcd.com ? xkcd.com seems much slower, and I keep getting &amp;quot;500 Internal server error&amp;quot; when accessing this site (explainxkcd.com). I guess that's the effect of having everybody hit F5 every few minutes :) [[Special:Contributions/193.239.192.194|193.239.192.194]] 11:57, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Earlier today, the server handled all the image redirections. The script you see above went through several mutations (currently at #8), with each mutation it seems that Randall is adding more servers and trying to split the load between them. This is basically how a bot-net works - we all run code written by some evil genius, and he's changing the code as time passes to serve some hidden purpose.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
When I saw this comic last night and that there was no explanation up, I thought to myself &amp;quot;How zen.&amp;quot;  I figured that Randall was going through a calm streak before throwing us the utterly ridiculous April 1st comic.  Did it come early, or does he have something even bigger planned for us? [[Special:Contributions/76.106.251.87|76.106.251.87]] 07:05, 26 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Of course, it is now &amp;quot;now&amp;quot; and there &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; an explanation, so that should answer your question.  Also, since it's not April 1st, and Randall has consistently released something major on that day, the jury is still out, leaving my question quite open (though I was really only asking for opinions).

For those wondering about the Javascript behind this: I posted my analysis of the Javascript [http://www.echochamber.me/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=101043&amp;amp;start=760#p3303579 on the xkcd forums], and further de-obfuscated and annotated the code over on [https://gist.github.com/cincodenada/5246094 GitHub].  Here's a quick summary though: it holds open a connection to xkcd's servers and listens for instructions and follows them. Those instructions are either &amp;quot;load a new image&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;reload the page&amp;quot;. So, you don't have to mash F5, it will automatically update the image when they're available. We have no way to control how fast the images come or when they do, and it's quite possible for them to update forever. --[[User:Fiveofoh|Fiveofoh]] ([[User talk:Fiveofoh|talk]]) 06:41, 27 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

This is a series of animation frames. I suspect they will only ever be shown once (based on the fact you can only get the current image, not previous or future images -- this is in keeping with the title, &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot;, which passes and which you can't ever get back]. The filenames are UUIDs too long to guess, so somebody needs to start collecting the filenames here so that a proper flipbook can be assembled.

*If you read the strip number (1190) backwards, you get 09/11&lt;br /&gt;
*This subject is recurrent on xkcd&lt;br /&gt;
*As far as we have seen, there is a destroyed tower and they are rebuilding it&lt;br /&gt;
*The next strip, following 1190 (or 09/11), mentions war against countries with large oil reserves but low military capacity. {{unsigned|143.107.105.14}}&lt;br /&gt;
:I feel like that's kind of a stretch, I'm pretty sure it's just a story about a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If a new strip goes up every 30 minutes our time, and if each strip comprises of, let's say for the sake of simplicity, one minute in their time; to build the sand castle [frames 24-117 = 93 frames] so far it's taken almost 2 days our time, which would be about an hour and a half their time if each frame is a minute.  Using my scale, an hour our time is 2 minutes their time, a day is 48 minutes, and our month is their 24 hour day.  If we assume Randall plans to give us a 24 hour period from that world's time, and we use the minute-per-frame rate I made up, than we'd probably be looking at a month of images our time.  I guess we'll just have to see how long he's got it planned to go on. -boB&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Has it ended? All that's left is the sandcastle, and there doesn't seem to have been anything else changed on it for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;

It's zooming out! When look at the gifs showing the frames in succession, the last 3 show the castle getting slightly smaller each time!&lt;br /&gt;
: It's true! The most recent also shows the edge of another castle, leading me to believe it's part of some kind of sand castle contest, probably including some of xkcd's other recurring characters!&lt;br /&gt;

Does anyone have an opinion on how we should continue naming the saved timeNN.png files if the updates do not continue on the half hour?&lt;br /&gt;
Right now the link for the skipped update 242 got renamed to the nonexistent time242NA.png and the next update's link is time242.png. But what do we do if the updates are changing to once per hour?

Strange: As far as I know http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time.png always redirects to the current frame. But if you visit the current one (133:00) at http://xkcd.com/1190/ and check the displayed image, it says 'c6976fbb244af4fc2286ffe3ac2cf78d408c1f610ecd71e18b4a677a048f084d.png' while time.png redirects to '1d9ce7199935b1b629d6b8744e62c7700a3780357b2dc74bb70471db616ddadb.png'.

&lt;br /&gt;
I'm seeing some strange stuff now. I have a script that uses wget of time.png to get the redirected hash png like Lockyy is doing. And I can verify that when you go to the 1190 page in the browser you get a different hash. But the previous hour and this hour, unlike the ones before it, the two hash pngs are different. And when I refresh the screen in my browser at the 1190 page, first I see the image I get from time.png, then the image refreshes with the other one. I'm not sure what this means or what we are supposed to do with it. I added the time.png hashes to the table for the last two hours but we probably need a way of indicating the difference. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 20:38, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: This latest hourly update did the same thing. If you are fast enough you can even get the first image in your browser by right click view image before it changes to the second one.

: Looking at it some more, I see that wget of the page at xkcd.com/1190/ gets you an img link to time.png and then there is the javascript that must after some delay get the different hash url image. That means that we had better be sure that we do not miss any manual checks of hourly updates because the scripts will never find that second image unless someone has a way of getting a script that runs the javascript as if it was a browser. As long as someone posts the hash of the image from the browser every hour, I can ensure that we have the hashes the scripts can get because I have a cron job checking for those updates every 15 minutes. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 21:49, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

When Megan coughed and Cueball asked if she was okay, did anyone else think of http://xkcd.com/931/ Lanes? Cueball explains that cancer treatment results are not known until much later, &amp;quot;and often the first sign is a cough or a bone pain.  So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry . . . .&amp;quot; ~~wrybred&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:I don't want to be a downer but this is just my interpretation thus far. I hope it is a happier theme but if you are correct wrybred, my further explanation would be the following... I think that building sandcastles is an analogy for living their life. Going for a swim in the body of water and the cough could represent the start of the cancer or possibly some time where they had to go out and &amp;quot;wade&amp;quot; in the possibilities of what cancer could mean. Time passes and Cueball says &amp;quot;I don't think we can build it much taller than this. It's been fun, though&amp;quot; which represents that they believe they have done as well as they can with the lives they have been given. They comment on the river retreating even though we the audience observe a body of water on the right hand side rising could represent how we can be fooled into believing things are going alright when in reality they are not. The reference to not understanding what the river is doing also fits this explanation well as someone with cancer may occasionally feel confused about their illness. Presently while I write this they are possibly preparing for a flood which represents the return of the cancer. If I were to guess what is next I might guess that they will watch as the flood comes in and destroys some of what they built but it is better than not having made the sandcastle in the first place. I could be way off, but Randall has given us a lot of TIME to think about what this is all about and your mind wanders. I also would note that this may not be about a particular cancer story, just any cancer story. [[User:Nhoel|Nhoel]] ([[User talk:Nhoel|talk]]) 13:51, 8 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

I'm guessing that the water will keep rising indefinitely, and we'll be left with an upward-moving strip that occasionally zooms out as the bottom layers are very slowly filled in with black &amp;quot;water.&amp;quot; One thing that would make this interesting is the varying heights of the constructed structures (sandcastle turrets, platform, etc.) which would make the process of &amp;quot;overflow&amp;quot; from the right-hand side interesting to watch. {{unsigned ip|65.96.75.37}}&lt;br /&gt;

Oh the symbolism of it: Cueball leaves, Megan finishes building their castle, rests and lets her guard down. The next thing to happen is, a cute girl walks in, sees what the two have built together and leaves. The very next frame, the castle starts to fall apart. [[Special:Contributions/217.81.90.198|217.81.90.198]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm expecting the lower level-castle to be swept away by the water, while the high-level castle will remain intact. This is quite reasonable, assuming Cueball and Megan knows how high the flood will come and thus they built the platform to an appropriate height. It may be interpreted as the lower-level castle being the work of our life, which is inevitable finite, and will be eventually overtaken by death. Recognizing this, some choose to build a castle for the &amp;quot;after-life&amp;quot;. Life-death reflections have been common on xkcd in the past as well. {{unsigned ip|149.241.18.229}}&lt;br /&gt;

For me, this is clearly about cancer and the impacts it has on a relationship over time. Randall's now wife was diagnosed and treated for cancer recently and through this comic, he's trying to portray the anxious wait they faced through treatment and remission.  He has put us into his shoes by keeping us waiting in suspense to see how things end up.  The passing of time represents their life together.  At first it's just them relaxing together, probably the dating phase.  Soon they start building a life together, represented by the sand castle.  The castle evolves over time, much like their life has.  Difficulties and gaffes in their relationship are depicted, for example when cueball trips and breaks down part of the wall.  Eventually all efforts are diverted and put into defending against the approaching sea, which represents the cancer.  The wall, the platform, all represent the steps taken to prevent and/or prepare for it's impending progress.  The river represents the cure for cancer, which is still pretty far out, as cueball mentioned.  There are many many more clues I see and explanations I can give to support this idea (castle in the sky, the rain, progress with research, etc.), but this is just starting point.  I'm excited to see where the comic will end up, but I guess we just need to &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;.  --[[User:Nick|Nick]] ([[User talk:Nick|talk]]) 21:25, 24 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

The cancer metaphors are quite intriguing, but my take is environmental, possibly pollution and global warming. The French girl (beret) could be a nod to the Disneyland Paris castle.

I'm taking it that &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; is a phonetic substitute for &amp;quot;c,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;meaning &amp;quot;cancer.&amp;quot;  For better or worse, this kind of phoenetic clue was used in the Batman movie:&lt;br /&gt;

Well, I don't know if the intention here is that the &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; is making the &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; grow.  My point is that the dialogue is so nonsensical at points that it seems to be code.  I'm taking every noun as a metaphor for something.  &amp;quot;Sea&amp;quot; being &amp;quot;cancer&amp;quot; seems to fit (&amp;quot;The cancer can't make more of itself forever, can it?&amp;quot;)  I guess go back through the dialogue and see what other words could substitute for what they're saying.  Like I said, I don't know what &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;rain&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ground&amp;quot; could be in this metaphor.

I agree - the water has started eroding the castle to the right, and it makes sense for the erosion to potentially loop the comic back to frame 1. That said, the title text was &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;. This could be a euphamism suggesting &amp;quot;keep waiting, this comic changes&amp;quot;, but it does have an implication that there is a &amp;quot;finale&amp;quot; to the comic that you should wait for.

The most recent event is Megan walking in, saying &amp;quot;bye!&amp;quot; in *lower case*, and leaving.  From the lower case, which is different from the rest of the comic, I infer that she was talking to *us*, not (eg) herself or the sandcastle!  I reckon it's just going to fill up with water until the page is a static black rectangle. Especially since she and Cueball just talked about going off and exploring, grabbed their bags, and left. -cosmogoblin [[Special:Contributions/94.197.127.235|94.197.127.235]] 13:57, 26 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Just wanted to say: I don't think the beret girl is a girl at all. It's a boy with an old-fashioned navy-style cap. Popular with boys at the beach (in the old days). See images here (http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x130/JTMarcus/h1.jpg) and here (http://cabinetcardgallery.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/kidwithcap_0003.jpg) I also like the fact that, just before the castle completely fades away, you can barely see the little boy bringing more materials (maybe another support beam?) to continue the work.&lt;br /&gt;
I like the continuity of letting the beret boy (not girl)&lt;br /&gt;
: Wether it's a navy cap or not may be open to interpretation (though I'd still bet it's a beret - it surely looks a lot more like the one the beret guy wears, and I think Randall would have put a little more effort into that detail if he wanted it to pass off as a navy cap). As for it being a boy, no. It's definitely a girl, you can clearly see it has a longer hair, and come to think of it, Randall rarely draws any hair at all for male characters anyway. --[[Special:Contributions/201.53.213.201|201.53.213.201]] 23:36, 29 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Odd, it looks like +861, +862, and +863 are out of order, judging by the ground not changing at all and the characters not walking continuously.

During the last glacial period the sea level was more than 100 meters lower than it is nowadays, so coastal structures looked very different and the continents exposed much more land. I believe the first act of this comic references medieval ages in Europe where people would witness (over the scope of hundreds of years or longer) losing land and coastal towns to the sea but not understanding the process, as Megan states. I'm expecting the second act, and possibly further acts, to reference the abundance of scientifical discoveries made during the last few centuries.

Well, they've made it back to the beach.  I think it will end either at 1000 or 1024, and the only reason it might go to 1024 is allow some dialog and zooming in. :-)  --[[User:Divad27182|Divad27182]] ([[User talk:Divad27182|talk]]) 18:01, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I thought that too initially - the terrain features certainly seems identical (to scale) to the one at the start of the story. But something's bothering me; it's about the frame before we see they are back on a beach - they are already seated, so it's fair to assume they haven't moved, yet the terrain is different. By looking at the terrain, you could guess that maybe the terrain is inverted, which would then indicate that the frame with the beach in view is from a different angle than the previous frame. But for that to be the case, Cueball would have to be behind Megan on the previous frame, yet, their positions are unchanged on these frames. So, I don't know...

Wait, what? It looks like they are suddenly back at a beach that looks the same as the first one, just zoomed out. But before when the scene was presumably inverted, the terrain didn't look quite like that. If the scene really did get inverted, maybe they aren't actually on a beach right now, but the sea will eventually expand until it reaches them. Then again, we don't know if this is the same plane of space that the original beach was either. They were just walking to the right. The concept of space in this comic is confusing me right now. I wonder if this will make sense later. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.63.158|129.21.63.158]] 18:41, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

It appears that the camera perspective has changed. 1 - 970 are all perpendicular to the shoreline, with the water on the right, camera looking down the shore. 971-996 are shown parallel to the shore line, with the camera position apparently out over the water or standing at the shore, looking back toward land. (If the camera had maintained the original position, the characters would have simply gotten smaller as the walked away, but instead we got to see the walk across the frame while presumably following the shore.) In 997, the camera perspective just comes back around to be a profile shot again, looking down the shoreline, water once again on the right. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.183.156.9|65.183.156.9]] 19:40, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Near the end of the transcript, it says that at +847 Beret Girl drops in again, dragging something.

&amp;quot;How long can this go on?  I would say a very long time.  Currently, each day is filled mostly with a very few backgrounds used over several comics with only the characters moving -- not that difficult to produce -- and maybe a few lines of dialog, which also allows for the repetition of the background.

== Image updates ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is Randall playing with me? My script is collecting at 00,05,20,35,50 each hour but many times now I got this:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
969:00 41/09:00 f8a6414c334a71481e16428691fe8465098b2bae956e44727d0482c7632a84ff.png &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I'm getting ...a84ff from http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time.png, but the main http://xkcd.com/1190/ gives the current image. [[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 23:43, 4 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
The 00:00 UTC (8 pm EDT) update worked. [[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 00:02, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Has anyone noticed that the exact same identical image was re-used several times recently? If you go to http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/ and tell it to show differences from frame 1090, and then start clicking forward, the following frames are all exactly the same: 1094, 1097, 1101, 1103, 1107. Looking at http://xkcd.aubronwood.com/# you can then see that 1111 and 1113 are also the same. The rapid perspective change makes the animation appear to strobe. Could this be some strange attempt to illustrate something like an earthquake, or are they just re-using frames to avoid having to draw so many?

== Hours ==&lt;br /&gt;
There seems to be a problem starting with today (Sunday, 2013-05-05): The first picture should be 984:00 and not 983:00. I'm not able to check if it's simply a bot (?) error writing down the hours or something more serious. --[[Special:Contributions/82.135.84.245|82.135.84.245]] 15:56, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Hour 983 on image 1104 Saturday (23:00 UTC) also appears on image 1105 Sunday (00:00 UTC). The image numbers are correct, but the hour count appears to be off by 1 hour now.[[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 16:34, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Not all images do map to the hash ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I did run this great command posted here before on 13 April 2013:&lt;br /&gt;
 md5sum -b * | sort | uniq -w32 -D&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then I did rename all duplicates to image???_.png. After that I did download the hashes from here to image???.png and run the check again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First result is easy. Files are changed so md5sum for image002_ and image002 are different but content is the same. But 004 is wrong and I will update this one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 878341ab1f710e5832aa7ed5cfa66ed7 *image002_.png&lt;br /&gt;
 878341ab1f710e5832aa7ed5cfa66ed7 *image004_.png&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Next duplicate is also easy because files are still the same:&lt;br /&gt;

 5de911984714c1ec7bf93149a5cca9b4 *image454.png&lt;br /&gt;

== Split the movie? ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The page is becoming impossible to load.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would suggest to split the movie into pieces, for instance by making a separate sub-page for each week (avoiding embarassing discussion on the most natural cutting point). Each week can have a separate description, seven-seconds animation, list of 7x24 pictures etc, and a link to the following and previous weeks.&lt;br /&gt;

Any objection / comment / suggestion ? [[User:Biem|Biem]] ([[User talk:Biem|talk]]) 05:16, 8 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:My only suggestion would be give it larger segments. I don't think it needs to be as small as a week - after all, it loaded fine for a very long time. Maybe approx. half a scene each? Scene 1 is 971 frames long, so how about split at 500, at 971, and again at 1500 (when it gets there)? [[Special:Contributions/24.129.75.17|24.129.75.17]] 08:12, 8 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Here is a possible breackdown structure where sequences are ~130 pictures long : (number of frames / Start frame number))&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Part 1 : Sand Castles&lt;br /&gt;
 (127) 001:  First sand castle&lt;br /&gt;
 (105) 128 : Second sand castle (180) and Catapulte&lt;br /&gt;
 (090) 233 : Joining castles&lt;br /&gt;
 (100) 323 : Miniature castle&lt;br /&gt;
 (116) 423 : Scaffold&lt;br /&gt;
 (131) 539 : Plattform&lt;br /&gt;
 (132) 670 : Fourth castle&lt;br /&gt;
 (173) 802 : Sea rising &amp;amp; fade out&lt;br /&gt;
Part 2 : Wildernesses&lt;br /&gt;
 (150) 975 : Seashore&lt;br /&gt;
 (100) 1125 : Rivershore&lt;br /&gt;
 (115) 1225 – : Hills&lt;br /&gt;
 (087) 1340 - 1363 – 1379 : Trees&lt;br /&gt;
 (124) 1427 : Baobabs&lt;br /&gt;
 1551 – 1581 Berries&lt;br /&gt;
 1619 – Squirrel&lt;br /&gt;
 1640 Berries&lt;br /&gt;
Suggestions that can be discussed :&lt;br /&gt;
* Sequences should be 100-150 pictures long (with possible exceptions).&lt;br /&gt;
* Even if the image is not that big, the length of the movie can be a problem when one wants to check for details : short sequences allow for a slower pace.&lt;br /&gt;
* Good cutting points would be : two consecutive identical pictures, changes of scenery. Sequences with the same theme should on the contrary be kept together when possible.&lt;br /&gt;

:This is not real life. And they know it's not real life. Maybe they are in some sort of Matrix and know about it, or they are playing a video game. They've seen in developers' blog that devs are working on a lot of new features for version 0.19, such as improved sand physics, multiple rivers, rain, salty water, trebuchets, swimming, surf, etc. But then developers decided to release part of these features in version 0.19, and leave the rest for 0.20. When Cueball an Megan saw that version 0.19 is out, they immediately decided to try it out, without even looking at the changelog. So they don't know which features made it into this version, and which ones will be in the next one. So far they have played around with new sand physics and trebuchets, tried swimming in the sea, tried to drink sea water, found a new river. They haven't seen any surf, so they think it'll be in 0.20. They have yet to try swimming in a river, or see the rain. They have also found a bug that causes sea level to raise indefinitely. They think it could be caused either by rain, additional rivers, or just by a griefer who built a giant sand generator array to fill in the sea and flood everything. Oh, and they can't just create a new private world to see if the sea raises there, because of the DRM.&lt;br /&gt;

Swimming in a river is dangerous if there's a strong current. Even slow moving water has a lot of power. The sea could be the ocean, connected to the ocean, or one of the large bodies of water referred to as a sea.

We know: &amp;quot;The sea is big&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The river is small&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But we also know about the sea: There are no waves. It's just rising. So it is not an ocean, it's just a lake. Many people say &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; to a lake when they can not see the other side.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And we know their home river is small. But right now they explore a different bigger river.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We know it's not summer so maybe it is spring and the river is rising like every year?&lt;br /&gt;

It seems like the two river halves (or two rivers) merge as Megan and Cueball hike upstream. New point: I joined all the images covering their journey since image 1150 (last stop for water). it spans 18204 pixels. Assuming Cueball is 6 feet tall (wild guess + it's an even number), they have now hiked a total of 0.517 miles (83228.7 cm) from image 1150.[[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 13:32, 10 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Considering the elaborate and fragile sand castles, the one- and two-person construction of the platform and its castle components, and maybe the latest antics at the top of the dunes, it appears that gravity is not Earth-normal.

== Archive ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since this 1190 will never end, will it? I think we need some archive sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First could be &amp;quot;1190 Time Images 2013-03 March&amp;quot; (&amp;lt;- I am calling this human readable ISO)&lt;br /&gt;
So, if you understand, each month of picture links and hashes on a separate page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next would be &amp;quot;1190 Time Images 2013-04 April&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

:::::::I wasn't shouting, there is no need to bring ad hominem into this discussion.

Each solution will lead to degradation of the explanation, splitting the article will force multiple page loads while removing the hash values will be destroying part of the metadata around the comic. Ideally, we wouldn't have to make the split at all, but speed considerations mean that we eventually will have to do it. In that eventuality, all we can do is the thing that degrades the explanation for the average visitor the least. What do visitors care more about, faster load times/having all the frames on one page or having 1000-odd incomprehensible and meaningless hash values? We don't display the individual filenames for Click and Drag even though they were more informative than the hashes here, because they hold little value to visitors; they only take up space that could be used to further enhance the explanation. Pure archival without curation is what other websites do, not a wiki with the intended goal of making xkcd accessible.

So Cueball and Megan seem to entering a region with much more vegetation. Up until now I had assumed that the previous regions had vegetation as well but Randall just hadn't bothered drawing it (such detail is rare in XKCD). So what does presence of vegetation mean? More rainfall? Higher elevation? Also how far have Cueball and Megan travelled? I don't think the frames are necessarily contiguous - if this was a movie we'd have background music to go with the images. They could have been travelling for days or weeks - I definitely don't think it is still the same day as the start of Act II. I suppose 'time' will tell.

The latest frame (1506) has two trees. They are almost certainly baobab trees. There are 8 species of baobab tree, but of those 8, 6 are endemic to the island of Madagascar, including the species which the trees in the comic most resemble, the Grandidier baobab. Even if they are not one of the six species endemic to Madagascar, the fact that they are baobabs still limits them to the continent of Africa, the countries of Oman and Yemen, and northwestern Australia. This means that the big sea, if it is an ocean, is most likely the Indian Ocean. [[Special:Contributions/76.92.118.150|76.92.118.150]] 18:30, 21 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Randall's animation is taking place in a distant, post-collapse future (&amp;quot;distant&amp;quot; is relative, here-- say sometime in the next few hundred years, though possibly much further): human civilization is back at a late-Iron Age stage of development, though maybe with slightly more sophisticated metallurgy. The reasons I suggest this are: 1) rising sea-level that is on-going, 2) they can work wood and they have agriculture, 3) they have shown no awareness of any more &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; technology, 4) yet they have no qualms about wandering off into the wilderness without what most of us would consider adequate protection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The one reason I might think it's farther into the future is the bit with the trees. I can't decide if their shape is a consequence of evolution (convergent, so that they are very similar to the {{w|Adansonia grandidieri}}), or they were transplanted (presumably to somewhere south? Higher altitude? Both? Antarctica?). Evolution would imply deeper in the future, and transplantation could be sooner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm really interested to see what the truth is, because it's got me thinking along all kinds of planes.[[Special:Contributions/184.99.231.23|184.99.231.23]] 21:38, 24 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

New clue, image 1692 - &amp;quot;Still, it's better than when we were following the sea, walking straight into the sun all morning.&amp;quot; Walking east along the sea, it places them on the south side of anything.

&lt;br /&gt;
This may be more speculation than not, but the two turned north to follow the river and are now walking on a heading somewhere between NE and NW, which puts them in the northern hemisphere if they can see their shadow in front of them. This is also confusing since there aren't many Grandidier's Baobab trees there [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia_grandidieri].[[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 20:46, 29 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I agree that these orientations are plausible from the dialog in the strip, but remember, we're already pretty certain that they're not in the same universe as us, so we may not be able to assume that the sun rises in the east. There's no evidence to demonstrate that their world rotates west-to-east like ours does, but there's no evidence that it doesn't, either. Let's at least remember the possibility that all of these directions are reversed from what our current theory states.

== The Planting People ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what do we know about them? They've been gone a while, long enough for Cueball to believe it was fine to take grapes.  But they haven't been gone for a long time, because we've seen a staked sapling that is likely only a year or two old. They have vineyards and what look to be orchards. They appear to use tents, at least the frame we saw looked to be tied together at the top to form a teepee frame. They are sophisticated enough to do things like put benches next to trees, so they aren't subsistence farmers. Anything else? [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 18:14, 28 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: Forgot a couple of things, they have what is possibly writing (are Cueball and Megan illiterate?), and it's different than that of the Hill People, but their debris appears to look the same.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They appear to be either hunter-gatherers or have abandoned the area (for some reason - why?). From [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomadic] &amp;quot;Many groups of 'nomadic' hunter-gatherers (also known as foragers) moved from campsite to campsite, following game and wild fruits and vegetables.&amp;quot; We have seen three campsites; Cueball burried the embers from their fire (see image 1048 &amp;amp; 1062-1064 [http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/?frame=1064]).

&lt;br /&gt;
:I did wonder about some kind of seasonal movement, but if so it's odd that they left the teepee to collapse (and be damaged, one of the supports is visibly cracked) rather than taking the materials with them or storing them more neatly.

Go to a vineyard in late summer or early autumn, you will not see the &amp;quot;The Planting People&amp;quot;. We only know that we are at this particular season because they can eat grapes from that plants and before they could swim in the sea.

&lt;br /&gt;
== What do we know by the end of May 2013? ==&lt;br /&gt;
I'm trying to collect some facts:&lt;br /&gt;
:-They did build a sand castle and the weather was warm enough to swim in the sea. The taste of the water is bad, and the sea is raising.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Then both are trying to find a reason for that raise and they are starting to travel around this special river.&lt;br /&gt;
:-They are still going uphill while we never have seen that mountains.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Eating grapes from a vineyard means we are at least at late summer.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Walking to the sun in the morning is just walking to the east.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
They are also apparently now heading west, or mostly west.  Their shadows are in front of them, and while that could be west in the morning or east in the evening, they are contrasting it with walking into the sun in the morning as they were along the shore, so it's west. Presumably they were walking mostly north until the decision to head for the mountains, since Cueball has just started playing with his shadow. [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 00:50, 30 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:OK, but they are walking to the sun in the morning. That's east (on northern hemisphere, I still do not think we are at Madagascar). So we do have an other fact:&lt;br /&gt;
:-Around time frame 1700 it's evening.&lt;br /&gt;
--[[User:Dgbrt|Dgbrt]] ([[User talk:Dgbrt|talk]]) 17:07, 30 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:-If you walk into the sun, you are walking east.&lt;br /&gt;
:-They then turned to their left to go upriver. That's would be going north.&lt;br /&gt;
:-If you are above the tropics, your shadow will always lay to the north of you.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Megan says what they're doing is better than when they had to walk into the sun, and it's been established that they walked along the sea for days, so they'd be familiar with walking with the sun directly behind them, too. If they were now walking west, it would pretty much be the same situation, except reversed. It doesn't really make sense to me that she'd call one situation better than the other. It feels more like they aren't walking into the sun ''at all'' anymore. Therefore, I think they are now keeping the sun relatively behind them by going north, which indicates they are north of the equator, and probably north of the Tropic of Cancer. Even at noon, the sun would be behind you slightly, to the south. And if you're walking uphill, it would be very visible to you.&lt;br /&gt;

== Snake Theories ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Megan mentions snakes with spikes over their eyes. That covers several species, all poisonous, but they are native to the American west and southwest, Mexico, Central America, north Africa and the Middle East. The snake that Cueball finds might be a {{w|Anguis fragilis|slow-worm}}, a limbless reptile native to Eurasia. It's shiny, brown, has a blunt head, and can shed its tail like a lizard, which might give it a half-finished look if Cueball saw it that way. But a stronger contender is the {{w|rubber boa}}, which is native to the western US, and has a famously stubby head and tail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This makes me think of one area: The {{w|Great Salt Lake}}. The {{w|Bear River (Utah)|Bear River}} empties into it from a northerly direction, and the area has the rubber boa and at least one type of poisonous horned snake. Native Americans of the area even had legends of the Horned Serpent. And that ''had'' to be a teepee we saw earlier. (I don't think Native Americans had trebuchets or berets, though....) --[[User:Druid816|Druid816]] ([[User talk:Druid816|talk]]) 01:59, 2 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

:I've been mapping the journey from the start, piecing each segment end-to-end in Photoshop. There is no significant net elevation change until they started following the river.

However, since this is a comic, one may assume a greater height than that actually depicted. The horizontal distance along the same river walk is 59516 pixels = 8927.4 feet (1.7 mi, 2.7 km). I don't have the distances along the sea. The average speed, using 1 hr/frame update, is 0.0025 mph, 0.0041 kph (at 5 min/frame update the speed increases to 0.0304 mph).

I'd like to think Cueball is shorter, I used 6 ft because it's convenient and yields longer distances. The tallest Baobob tree is 516 px (rescaled to the running comic) = 77.4 ft (23.6 m) using a 6 ft Cueball. Note that using a 5.5 ft (1.7 m) Cueball, the tree drops to 71 ft (21.6 m). The Wikipedia page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia_grandidieri] on the Grandidier's baobab states they can reach 25 to 30 m (80-100 ft) in height, 23.6 m is about right.

I don't follow this as religously as others so maybe I missed the obvious answer, but why is it assumed that we have seen all of the way they went?

(please sign your posts - don't worry, we're all here out of a mutual enjoyment of the xkcd comics) Actually, I looked into the possibility a while back, but it didn't work. Randall runs 3-5 frame updates with the two walking across the same panel. As they leave one panel on the right, they enter the next on the left (and visa-verse for the trip back to the sunken castle).

It was after &amp;quot;f4e2276e4c47409412666b28be0cca75fedae3c182c4017932891c147004c720.png&amp;quot;, followed by a few more of that reference and then by &amp;quot;133fddaecbdee3f5160771b68ce02cbc2b4b1c84a40faffb1bcaa6f75588edd0.png&amp;quot;.  At the time, I did not get a copy of the image, and it is not now available for download.&lt;br /&gt;
Did anybody else see this image, and does anybody have a copy of it?&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I'm just going to say it if your going to infect them anyway and not update them why would you need to get licenses legally. okies i said what we're all thinking byesies[[Special:Contributions/24.2.26.20|24.2.26.20]] 20:06, 14 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: License are not for the updates.  Licenses are to not be committing copyright violation, and thus to be legal.  --[[User:Divad27182|Divad27182]] ([[User talk:Divad27182|talk]]) 16:41, 5 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

&lt;div&gt;{{comic&lt;br /&gt;
| number    = 350&lt;br /&gt;
| date      = November 28, 2007&lt;br /&gt;
| title     = Network&lt;br /&gt;
| image     = network.png&lt;br /&gt;

}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Explanation==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Cueball]] shows off his virtual fishtank of virus infected virtual Windows machines to [[Megan]].&lt;br /&gt;
The machines nominally have {{w|Trojan_horse_(computing)|mail trojans}}, {{w|warhol worms}}, all sorts of {{w|polymorphic virus|polymorphic viruses}}, and explicitly {{w|Blaster_(computer_worm)|Blaster}} and {{w|w32.welchia}}.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first part of the title text refers to the difficulty viruses have in disabling the internet as a whole.  SQL Slammer had some brief success.  &lt;br /&gt;
The second part of the title text refers to the fact that Linux, and MacOS 10 and later are more difficult to infect.&lt;br /&gt;
It is thought by some that they are immune to viruses, but this isn't true.&lt;br /&gt;
In particular, Linux can be particularly difficult to infect because the code can easily vary from machine to machine and distribution to distribution. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This virtual fishtank is actually a viable system to setup.&lt;br /&gt;
There are a couple problems.&lt;br /&gt;
The first is that one would (legally) need to get Windows licenses for all the virtual machines.&lt;br /&gt;
The second is that, unless one does a good job isolating the systems, you could allow the viruses into other parts of your computers, or into the internet at large, neither of which is something one should do.&lt;br /&gt;
I would expect virus scanner companies to actually have such systems.&lt;br /&gt;
(Rederences to available systems would be good.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Transcript==&lt;br /&gt;

:: [Side view. The screen is a huge LCD connected to a wireless router.]&lt;br /&gt;
:: Guy: Pretty, isn't it?&lt;br /&gt;
:: Girl: What is it?&lt;br /&gt;

==Explanation==&lt;br /&gt;
{{incomplete}}&lt;br /&gt;
The comic is an illustration of passing time. Each image is relatively meaningless to the viewer by itself; the only way to perceive time is to &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot; and see how things evolve. Thus, time is in the viewer's perception, not in each individual frame. It is not entirely clear if the &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot; title text references the viewer having to wait for the next frame of the comic, or whether it refers in some way to the content of the comic itself (e.g. the characters waiting for something).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Format===&lt;br /&gt;
This comic is actually a series of images which play as a rough animation (the image on this page is an animated compilation of the images). The images are in the process of being revealed slowly over the course of time. As of April 29, 2013, the comic has been running for more than 800 hours (over 36 days), and more than 900 frames have been revealed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the first 120 hours, a new frame replaced the previous frame every 30 minutes, at :00 and :30 of each hour; the remaining frames have since been revealed every hour, on the hour. The updating is done server-side, with the server redirecting the image link (time.png) to a different image every hour. The source images have very long random-character names, making it virtually impossible to access future frames. There is no apparent way to view past frames on the official XKCD website, and only the current frame is posted there at any given time. Given the unique nature of this comic, several websites have been dedicated to tracking it, and its full run can be viewed at some of these sites (see below).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At 850 hours (36 days 10 hours) the first &amp;quot;scene&amp;quot; of the comic ended at frame 971 with a fade to white, ushering in a second scene from frame 972. Normalized pictures are also available here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Plot===&lt;br /&gt;
====Scene 1====&lt;br /&gt;
[[Megan]] and [[Cueball]] are alone on a sandy beach near the sea. As the story unfolds, Megan and Cueball begin to build a {{w|sand castle}} on the beach. The two continue to expand the castle back from the beach as the scene zooms out. Briefly they have fun launching small objects at the castle with a {{w|trebuchet}} before continuing the build.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each of Cueball and Megan leave the scene for extended periods at times but always return to continue building. They add what appears to be scaffolding and ladders to expand the castle skyward. All the while, Cueball and Megan wax philosophically about the nature of the sea, the feeding river, the rising tides, and what else lies in the world. In the end, the two decide to go off and explore the world as the sea begins to erode the castle and the scene fades to white.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One other character appears in the comic as of the end of Scene 1: A girl with a beret, similar to [[Beret Guy]], briefly appears to view the castle, and then leaves. She returns in the last couple of frames, as the fade to white completes, dragging something. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Scene 2====&lt;br /&gt;
Cueball and Megan are walking with bags across a relatively level surface. They stop for a drink. Megan indicates she has never been so far &amp;quot;this way&amp;quot;. At frame 997, they sit down and in frame 998, the scene shifts from a front view to a profile view. The terrain looks like frame 1, albeit from a wider angle, showing they are walking along the coast. They begin to stand in frame 1001 and the scene returns to a front view.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They begin walking again and reach a river they haven't seen before. They sit on the river bank and Cueball slips in and loses his bottle. The two try to lasso the bottle but are unsuccessful. Cueball contemplates swimming out to get it, but Megan says it is too dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After a small talk both did agree to find a &amp;quot;ford&amp;quot;. But while they still did not get a way to the other side they found that the &amp;quot;other side&amp;quot; was merely an island, and the river was wider than they realized.&lt;br /&gt;

:+199:00 [Building the mound]&lt;br /&gt;

::Megan: Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;
: +416:00&lt;br /&gt;
::Megan: The sea is rising.&lt;br /&gt;

: +441:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: Sea level rises and falls, right? It's changed before.&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: Not this fast.&lt;br /&gt;
: +442:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: The river hasn't even reached the sea yet.&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: The river is small&lt;br /&gt;

:: Cueball: I don't know.&lt;br /&gt;
: +517:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: If it does, it seems like a waste.&lt;br /&gt;
: +519:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: It rains in the hills where the river comes from, right?&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: Sure.&lt;br /&gt;
: +520:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: Are there ''other'' rivers?&lt;br /&gt;
: +521:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: I don't know.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
: +538:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: There must be other rivers.&lt;br /&gt;
::: Otherwise the sea would dry up.&lt;br /&gt;
: +539:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: Maybe it's coming out of the ground.&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: Does that happen?&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: I don't know.&lt;br /&gt;
: +540:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: I don't know how the sea works.&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: I don't know how ''anything'' works.&lt;br /&gt;
: +541:00 [The levee finally starts to give way.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +543:00 [Megan and Cueball get down and look at the water, where the levee is now submerged.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +547:00 [Megan begins transferring sand to Cueball via a pulley and bucket system.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +552:00 [Megan attempts to hoist herself up using said pulley and bucket system.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +554:00 [Megan loses her balance and falls off.]&lt;br /&gt;

:: Megan: I don't think it's going to stop.&lt;br /&gt;
: +712:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: The sea can't just make more of itself forever.&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: It can do whatever it wants. It's the sea.&lt;br /&gt;
: +713:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: There must be a reason. There's a reason for everything.&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;
: +714:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: But it's not always a ''good'' reason.&lt;br /&gt;
: +717:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: There must be other rivers. Maybe something is wrong with them.&lt;br /&gt;
: +734:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: I like our castle.&lt;br /&gt;
: +735:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: I think it's going to go away.&lt;br /&gt;
: +736:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;
: +738:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: Do you think there are other rivers?&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: '''''Something''''' is adding water to the sea.&lt;br /&gt;
: +739:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: Does it have to be water? Maybe something is adding more land somewhere. And it's making the sea overflow.&lt;br /&gt;
: +740:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: Or maybe it's just raining somewhere. We have no idea what's out there.&lt;br /&gt;
: +741:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;
: +743:00&lt;br /&gt;

:: Megan: ''bye.''&lt;br /&gt;
: +761:00 [Megan exits.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +775:00 [The entire scene begins a slow fade to white. The 'tide' continues to rise and the castle on the right continues to be subsumed.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +830:00 [Beret Girl drops in for one frame. The fade and tide continue.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +847:00 [Beret Girl drops in again, dragging something. The fade and tide continue.] (In fact, this detail was not visible without an aid to undo the fade.)&lt;br /&gt;

: +870:00 [Megan continues walking.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +871:00 [Cueball continues walking.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +875:00 [They stop, sit and eat. The perspective changes showing they're in a landscape similar to time +0:00.]&lt;br /&gt;

: +880:00 [They prepare to continue.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +881:00 [They continue walking. The perspective returns to &amp;quot;parallel to the beach&amp;quot;.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +883:00 [Still walking.]&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: Maybe the sea doesn't end.&lt;br /&gt;
: +884:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: We haven't walked very far.&lt;br /&gt;
: +885:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: But that's what the first part of not ending looks like.&lt;br /&gt;
: +897:00 [Still walking.]&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: If we don't find something today, we'll have to start using the steam bottle.&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;
: +902:00 [They stop, having come to another body of water.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +903:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: Yes.&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: Yes what?&lt;br /&gt;
: +904:00 [The scene zooms out briefly, showing the opposite shore.]&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: There are other rivers.&lt;br /&gt;
: +908:00 [Cueball, having sat on the bank to drink, falls into the river when the bank beneath him crumbles. Megan manages to grab him and pull him back to dry land, but he loses his water bottle in the process.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +914:00 [Megan pulls out a lasso. Cueball and her both use it to try and grab the bottle. They fail.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +920:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: The river isn't moving that fast. Maybe I could-&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: Too dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;
: +921:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: It's ok. It was an accident.&lt;br /&gt;
: +923:00 [The bottle slips below the surface.]&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: You're right, though.&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: About what?&lt;br /&gt;
: +924:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: The river's not moving very fast.&lt;br /&gt;
: +928:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: It can't be flowing much faster than we walk.&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: Even if it's as deep as it is wide, I don't think it's enough water.&lt;br /&gt;
: +929:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: Yeah&lt;br /&gt;
: +931:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: And this river doesn't ''look'' broken.&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;
: +932:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: It's pretty neat, though.&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: ''Yeah.''&lt;br /&gt;
: +935:00 [Cueball grabs Megan's hand and gently pulls her back from the edge.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +937:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: Sorry.&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: No, right. Forgot.&lt;br /&gt;
: +941:00 [Megan exits. Cueball begins digging into the ground.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +943:00 [Cueball fills in the hole he created.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +945:00 [Megan is back after checking the sea level.]&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: It's still rising.&lt;br /&gt;
: +946:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: It's strange - Rivers flow to meet the sea - Maybe the sea couldn't wait.&lt;br /&gt;
: +948:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: Walk upriver to find a ford, or turn back?&lt;br /&gt;
: +950:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: We can't go back. We don't understand everything yet.&lt;br /&gt;
: +951:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: &amp;quot;Everything&amp;quot; is a little ambitious. We barely understand anything.&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;
: +952:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: But that's what the first part of understanding everything looks like.&lt;br /&gt;
: +972:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Cueball: If nothing else, I'm glad we found this river. It's not much farther from home than ours at its driest.&lt;br /&gt;
: +975:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: Oh. This river is even bigger than it looked.&lt;br /&gt;
: +976:00 [The scene zooms out to show the opposite bank again. It continues to zoom out slowly, revealing that the &amp;quot;opposite bank&amp;quot; is actually just an island in the much, much larger river. Cueball and Megan continue to walk away from the viewer.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +990:00 [Megan and Cueball finally pass the end of the island. The scene zooms out even farther once more to show the far bank.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +1001:00 [The scene returns to original zoom, with Megan and Cueball looking out over the river.]&lt;br /&gt;
: +1002:00&lt;br /&gt;
:: Megan: Maybe it ''is'' big enough to fill the sea.&lt;br /&gt;
