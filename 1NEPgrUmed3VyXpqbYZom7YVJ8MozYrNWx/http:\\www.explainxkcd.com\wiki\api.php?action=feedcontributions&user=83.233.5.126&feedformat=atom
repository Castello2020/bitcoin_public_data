[[Special:Contributions/72.21.198.66|72.21.198.66]] 05:11, 25 March 2013 (UTC)It could be a reference to the old proverb &amp;quot; time and tide wait for none&amp;quot; Cueball and the girl could be waiting for the tide in the beach! (Just a guess)[[Special:Contributions/72.21.198.66|72.21.198.66]] 05:11, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This could be a cinematic custom to change scenes or to show the passage of time: fade to black (white) on Act I, come up on Act II. Get some popcorn during the intermission.{{unsigned|Gerry|11:38, 29 April 2013 (UTC)}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The picture does chance with time. The URL includes a changing timestamp that I can't decipher. Compare these two URLS (which have slightly different images:&lt;br /&gt;
http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/8eb156cce408df8bb83528382d6a2aa2ce6c74f3c573fd12b058cd1c56420672.png&lt;br /&gt;
http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/1e349a579b5f9b5ed487ddf7e88244b70330941ddedac9c6abf6ed2e3f589b97.png&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps there is a way to hack the URL to view future images. [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:29, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I would also like to add that knowing randall, these are not the only images. For all we know, the image will still be changing in 5 years while a tree grows in front of them. My point is: Are the URLs hackable, or did he encrypt them? [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:33, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Likely there is a way to hack the URLs; they look like some sort of hash, probably a hashed timestamp. Of course, he could easily have added some salt to the hash, making it significantly *harder* to hack. But they're strings of a specific length, so it should be pretty easy to bruteforce it, fetch all the images, and then (maybe) reverse-engineer the sequence. *That* all depends on how many of them there are. [[Special:Contributions/76.90.249.178|76.90.249.178]] 05:44, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
:Good god, do you see how many digits are *in* that hash? The sun'll have burned out by the time we've tested every possible combination of digits. '''[[User:Davidy22|&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;{{Color|purple|David}}&amp;lt;font color=green size=3px&amp;gt;y&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;&amp;lt;font color=indigo size=4px&amp;gt;²²&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;]]'''[[User talk:Davidy22|&amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;[talk]&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt;]] 05:47, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
:: The URLs are 64 hex characters. If he doesnt want us to find these pictures ahead of time, he would have made them completely random data, not a hash of anything. There are 16 possibilites for hex characters so 16^64 combinations or 1.7x10^308 combinations. If we made a supercomputer to try a billion links per second, and if there are 10,000 images total, it would take 4×10^277 × 13.77 billion years, which is a number with 277 zeros times the age of the universe to find just the first additional image. The sun will expand into a red giant and engulf the earth or at least come close enough to boil off all the water in the oceans in a mere 5.4 billion years, less than even one additional age of the universe. It will even be after the last star to ever be born has burned out, and all life in the universe has died before we could find even one. [[Special:Contributions/65.50.74.245|65.50.74.245]] 19:11, 16 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It seems that the image is updated every 1/2 hour. [[Special:Contributions/152.23.97.150|152.23.97.150]] 06:17, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: Given that the images switch back and forth between other images already seen, and that the comic should be viewable in the future, it seems unlikely that it's any thing like a simple sha256 of part of the timestamp.  I think it's more likely a function of half-hours and minutes (assuming we continue to get a new possible image every half-hour). [[Special:Contributions/99.153.248.206|99.153.248.206]] 06:59, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
::: The images do cycle, yes. But for some reason I have never seen the img where Megan is looking behind her. Also wouldn't it be difficult to show a sequential story (like the rising tide) if the previous images keep cycling ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hash appears to be SHA-256. I tried some obvious hashes (&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;11901&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190_1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190.1&amp;quot;) to no avail. Maybe this is HMAC-SHA256? Also, I would suggest trying Unix timestamps. [[Special:Contributions/131.156.236.149|131.156.236.149]] 06:19, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I've been trying to make educated guesses as to what's being hashed here: http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator ... he could also be using hash(hash2(value)) which would be virtually impossible to crack. [[Special:Contributions/99.153.248.206|99.153.248.206]] 06:59, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's entirely possible that the &amp;quot;hash&amp;quot; is actually randomly generated. Just a thought. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.119.153|129.21.119.153]] 07:03, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regarding sha256. Its most likely some hash of a timestamp, but if he doesnt wants us to crack it, he would have prefixes a password.. sha256('secretcode17:30'). Im just saying, if he doesnt wants us to crack it, we most likely cant.&lt;br /&gt;
I've tested all unixtimestamps from 1300000000 to 1364390334. Also &amp;quot;00:00&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;23:59&amp;quot;, with and without the colon and a load of other formats. {{unsigned|77.243.128.133}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alright, this is probably not going to work, but I'm trying to exploit Randall's awesomeness here. Maybe he decided to take the time-stamps from the user? I don't know if that's even possible... That would then allow people in different time zones to obtain different images simultaneously. (What's the corollary of Godwin's law for a bunch of math-and-science nerds and relativity? Is there one?) Clicking the img src url on the comic's html page, give me this: http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/752687b61523144c61736cd89f8c153dc41e19128f72d78d44947ff800f057fa.png : Never mind.. apparently others see the same image too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Could he be doing this live? Monitoring the discussion on the net? Collaborative, crowdsourced comic-ing? Reminds me of those you-decide-what-the-character-does-next-and-flip-to-appropriate-page parallel plot novels.&lt;br /&gt;

:Doesn't really help. The script basically changes the image when something happens (probably some time passes, although it's possible there is more hidden there). WHAT image then appears is not directed by the script, but by the site. Specifically, the image displayed as first is taken from [http://c0.xkcd.com/redirect/comic/time http://c0.xkcd.com/redirect/comic/time], while the script asks for [http://c0.xkcd.com/stream/comic/time?method=EventSource&amp;amp;r=(somenumber) http://c0.xkcd.com/stream/comic/time?method=EventSource&amp;amp;r=(somenumber)] ... which is, if you get correct &amp;quot;r&amp;quot;, probably some json containing the image url.

&lt;br /&gt;
:: ... actually, given that the script part doesn't seem to do anything just now, it's even possible it's for later (ie, starts producing images when the correct time come).

:::Thanks for explaining. Why hasn't anyone posted this before? Could &amp;quot;location.hash&amp;quot; possibly have anything to do with the method used to generate the image hash key?

&lt;br /&gt;
:::: &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;location&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is the URI of the page. &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;location.hash&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is the part of the uri after the ''#'' character. If you go to [https://xkcd.com/1190/#verbose https://xkcd.com/1190/#verbose], you'll see some debugging output in your browser's debugging console (Firefox: Web Console or Firebug, Chrome: Development Tools).

::::: Well, I don't know what's doing it, but there's definitely some script (probably this script) that's refreshing the image automatically.

I guess that's the effect of having everybody hit F5 every few minutes :) [[Special:Contributions/193.239.192.194|193.239.192.194]] 11:57, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Earlier today, the server handled all the image redirections. The script you see above went through several mutations (currently at #8), with each mutation it seems that Randall is adding more servers and trying to split the load between them. This is basically how a bot-net works - we all run code written by some evil genius, and he's changing the code as time passes to serve some hidden purpose.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
When I saw this comic last night and that there was no explanation up, I thought to myself &amp;quot;How zen.&amp;quot;  I figured that Randall was going through a calm streak before throwing us the utterly ridiculous April 1st comic.  Did it come early, or does he have something even bigger planned for us? [[Special:Contributions/76.106.251.87|76.106.251.87]] 07:05, 26 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Also, since it's not April 1st, and Randall has consistently released something major on that day, the jury is still out, leaving my question quite open (though I was really only asking for opinions).

For those wondering about the Javascript behind this: I posted my analysis of the Javascript [http://www.echochamber.me/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=101043&amp;amp;start=760#p3303579 on the xkcd forums], and further de-obfuscated and annotated the code over on [https://gist.github.com/cincodenada/5246094 GitHub].  Here's a quick summary though: it holds open a connection to xkcd's servers and listens for instructions and follows them. Those instructions are either &amp;quot;load a new image&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;reload the page&amp;quot;. So, you don't have to mash F5, it will automatically update the image when they're available. We have no way to control how fast the images come or when they do, and it's quite possible for them to update forever. --[[User:Fiveofoh|Fiveofoh]] ([[User talk:Fiveofoh|talk]]) 06:41, 27 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

This is a series of animation frames.

*If you read the strip number (1190) backwards, you get 09/11&lt;br /&gt;
*This subject is recurrent on xkcd&lt;br /&gt;
*As far as we have seen, there is a destroyed tower and they are rebuilding it&lt;br /&gt;
*The next strip, following 1190 (or 09/11), mentions war against countries with large oil reserves but low military capacity. {{unsigned|143.107.105.14}}&lt;br /&gt;
:I feel like that's kind of a stretch, I'm pretty sure it's just a story about a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If a new strip goes up every 30 minutes our time, and if each strip comprises of, let's say for the sake of simplicity, one minute in their time; to build the sand castle [frames 24-117 = 93 frames] so far it's taken almost 2 days our time, which would be about an hour and a half their time if each frame is a minute.  Using my scale, an hour our time is 2 minutes their time, a day is 48 minutes, and our month is their 24 hour day.  If we assume Randall plans to give us a 24 hour period from that world's time, and we use the minute-per-frame rate I made up, than we'd probably be looking at a month of images our time.  I guess we'll just have to see how long he's got it planned to go on. -boB&lt;br /&gt;

It's zooming out! When look at the gifs showing the frames in succession, the last 3 show the castle getting slightly smaller each time!&lt;br /&gt;

Right now the link for the skipped update 242 got renamed to the nonexistent time242NA.png and the next update's link is time242.png. But what do we do if the updates are changing to once per hour?

Strange: As far as I know http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time.png always redirects to the current frame. But if you visit the current one (133:00) at http://xkcd.com/1190/ and check the displayed image, it says 'c6976fbb244af4fc2286ffe3ac2cf78d408c1f610ecd71e18b4a677a048f084d.png' while time.png redirects to '1d9ce7199935b1b629d6b8744e62c7700a3780357b2dc74bb70471db616ddadb.png'.

&lt;br /&gt;
I'm seeing some strange stuff now. I have a script that uses wget of time.png to get the redirected hash png like Lockyy is doing. And I can verify that when you go to the 1190 page in the browser you get a different hash. But the previous hour and this hour, unlike the ones before it, the two hash pngs are different. And when I refresh the screen in my browser at the 1190 page, first I see the image I get from time.png, then the image refreshes with the other one. I'm not sure what this means or what we are supposed to do with it. I added the time.png hashes to the table for the last two hours but we probably need a way of indicating the difference. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 20:38, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

: Looking at it some more, I see that wget of the page at xkcd.com/1190/ gets you an img link to time.png and then there is the javascript that must after some delay get the different hash url image. That means that we had better be sure that we do not miss any manual checks of hourly updates because the scripts will never find that second image unless someone has a way of getting a script that runs the javascript as if it was a browser. As long as someone posts the hash of the image from the browser every hour, I can ensure that we have the hashes the scripts can get because I have a cron job checking for those updates every 15 minutes. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 21:49, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

When Megan coughed and Cueball asked if she was okay, did anyone else think of http://xkcd.com/931/ Lanes? Cueball explains that cancer treatment results are not known until much later, &amp;quot;and often the first sign is a cough or a bone pain.  So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry . . . .&amp;quot; ~~wrybred&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:I don't want to be a downer but this is just my interpretation thus far. I hope it is a happier theme but if you are correct wrybred, my further explanation would be the following... I think that building sandcastles is an analogy for living their life. Going for a swim in the body of water and the cough could represent the start of the cancer or possibly some time where they had to go out and &amp;quot;wade&amp;quot; in the possibilities of what cancer could mean. Time passes and Cueball says &amp;quot;I don't think we can build it much taller than this. It's been fun, though&amp;quot; which represents that they believe they have done as well as they can with the lives they have been given. They comment on the river retreating even though we the audience observe a body of water on the right hand side rising could represent how we can be fooled into believing things are going alright when in reality they are not. The reference to not understanding what the river is doing also fits this explanation well as someone with cancer may occasionally feel confused about their illness. Presently while I write this they are possibly preparing for a flood which represents the return of the cancer. If I were to guess what is next I might guess that they will watch as the flood comes in and destroys some of what they built but it is better than not having made the sandcastle in the first place. I could be way off, but Randall has given us a lot of TIME to think about what this is all about and your mind wanders. I also would note that this may not be about a particular cancer story, just any cancer story. [[User:Nhoel|Nhoel]] ([[User talk:Nhoel|talk]]) 13:51, 8 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

:It's pretty obvious to me. They're on a beach with a river running through it. Yes, beaches sometimes have rivers in them.

I think by tasting the water Cueball was preparing himself for the inevitable - the water is going to continue to rise and nothing they can do will stop it: they are going to drown.

:Seriously? Ok - time to review the physics of hydrostatic fluids, folks.  Depth is the only variable in calculating fluid pressure.

If this were a 2D universe, wouldn't the best course of action be to bury one of the poles directly at the water's edge?

I'm guessing that the water will keep rising indefinitely, and we'll be left with an upward-moving strip that occasionally zooms out as the bottom layers are very slowly filled in with black &amp;quot;water.&amp;quot; One thing that would make this interesting is the varying heights of the constructed structures (sandcastle turrets, platform, etc.) which would make the process of &amp;quot;overflow&amp;quot; from the right-hand side interesting to watch. {{unsigned ip|65.96.75.37}}&lt;br /&gt;

Oh the symbolism of it: Cueball leaves, Megan finishes building their castle, rests and lets her guard down. The next thing to happen is, a cute girl walks in, sees what the two have built together and leaves. The very next frame, the castle starts to fall apart. [[Special:Contributions/217.81.90.198|217.81.90.198]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm expecting the lower level-castle to be swept away by the water, while the high-level castle will remain intact. This is quite reasonable, assuming Cueball and Megan knows how high the flood will come and thus they built the platform to an appropriate height. It may be interpreted as the lower-level castle being the work of our life, which is inevitable finite, and will be eventually overtaken by death. Recognizing this, some choose to build a castle for the &amp;quot;after-life&amp;quot;. Life-death reflections have been common on xkcd in the past as well. {{unsigned ip|149.241.18.229}}&lt;br /&gt;

For me, this is clearly about cancer and the impacts it has on a relationship over time. Randall's now wife was diagnosed and treated for cancer recently and through this comic, he's trying to portray the anxious wait they faced through treatment and remission.  He has put us into his shoes by keeping us waiting in suspense to see how things end up.  The passing of time represents their life together.  At first it's just them relaxing together, probably the dating phase.  Soon they start building a life together, represented by the sand castle.  The castle evolves over time, much like their life has.  Difficulties and gaffes in their relationship are depicted, for example when cueball trips and breaks down part of the wall.  Eventually all efforts are diverted and put into defending against the approaching sea, which represents the cancer.  The wall, the platform, all represent the steps taken to prevent and/or prepare for it's impending progress.  The river represents the cure for cancer, which is still pretty far out, as cueball mentioned.  There are many many more clues I see and explanations I can give to support this idea (castle in the sky, the rain, progress with research, etc.), but this is just starting point.  I'm excited to see where the comic will end up, but I guess we just need to &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;.  --[[User:Nick|Nick]] ([[User talk:Nick|talk]]) 21:25, 24 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

:You make a good case, and much of the dialog supports that interpretation.  Many of us must have been thinking along the same lines.  A couple of points...there doesn't have to be only one meaning for the symbolism.  Also, there doesn't have to be an &amp;quot;end.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

The cancer metaphors are quite intriguing, but my take is environmental, possibly pollution and global warming. The French girl (beret) could be a nod to the Disneyland Paris castle.

I'm taking it that &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; is a phonetic substitute for &amp;quot;c,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;meaning &amp;quot;cancer.&amp;quot;  For better or worse, this kind of phoenetic clue was used in the Batman movie:&lt;br /&gt;

Well, I don't know if the intention here is that the &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; is making the &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; grow.  My point is that the dialogue is so nonsensical at points that it seems to be code.  I'm taking every noun as a metaphor for something.  &amp;quot;Sea&amp;quot; being &amp;quot;cancer&amp;quot; seems to fit (&amp;quot;The cancer can't make more of itself forever, can it?&amp;quot;)  I guess go back through the dialogue and see what other words could substitute for what they're saying.  Like I said, I don't know what &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;rain&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ground&amp;quot; could be in this metaphor.

I agree - the water has started eroding the castle to the right, and it makes sense for the erosion to potentially loop the comic back to frame 1. That said, the title text was &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;. This could be a euphamism suggesting &amp;quot;keep waiting, this comic changes&amp;quot;, but it does have an implication that there is a &amp;quot;finale&amp;quot; to the comic that you should wait for.

The most recent event is Megan walking in, saying &amp;quot;bye!&amp;quot; in *lower case*, and leaving.  From the lower case, which is different from the rest of the comic, I infer that she was talking to *us*, not (eg) herself or the sandcastle!  I reckon it's just going to fill up with water until the page is a static black rectangle. Especially since she and Cueball just talked about going off and exploring, grabbed their bags, and left. -cosmogoblin [[Special:Contributions/94.197.127.235|94.197.127.235]] 13:57, 26 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

::: The &amp;quot;both-sides&amp;quot; erosion is normal and realistic.

Seems like the story is not going to stop with total fadeout: image is still readable, as what was black is going to be 100% transparent (and probably still black), and white is still opaque.

Just wanted to say: I don't think the beret girl is a girl at all. It's a boy with an old-fashioned navy-style cap. Popular with boys at the beach (in the old days). See images here (http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x130/JTMarcus/h1.jpg) and here (http://cabinetcardgallery.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/kidwithcap_0003.jpg) I also like the fact that, just before the castle completely fades away, you can barely see the little boy bringing more materials (maybe another support beam?) to continue the work.&lt;br /&gt;
I like the continuity of letting the beret boy (not girl)&lt;br /&gt;
: Wether it's a navy cap or not may be open to interpretation (though I'd still bet it's a beret - it surely looks a lot more like the one the beret guy wears, and I think Randall would have put a little more effort into that detail if he wanted it to pass off as a navy cap). As for it being a boy, no. It's definitely a girl, you can clearly see it has a longer hair, and come to think of it, Randall rarely draws any hair at all for male characters anyway. --[[Special:Contributions/201.53.213.201|201.53.213.201]] 23:36, 29 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

I am hoping that this &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; somehow connects to the [http://xkcd.com/1110/ &amp;quot;Click and Drag&amp;quot;] comic i.e. when the camera zoom out far enough, we'll see that they are actually in the &amp;quot;Click and Drag&amp;quot; world. --[[Special:Contributions/98.14.191.109|98.14.191.109]] 23:59, 29 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Odd, it looks like +861, +862, and +863 are out of order, judging by the ground not changing at all and the characters not walking continuously.

During the last glacial period the sea level was more than 100 meters lower than it is nowadays, so coastal structures looked very different and the continents exposed much more land. I believe the first act of this comic references medieval ages in Europe where people would witness (over the scope of hundreds of years or longer) losing land and coastal towns to the sea but not understanding the process, as Megan states. I'm expecting the second act, and possibly further acts, to reference the abundance of scientifical discoveries made during the last few centuries.

Well, they've made it back to the beach.  I think it will end either at 1000 or 1024, and the only reason it might go to 1024 is allow some dialog and zooming in. :-)  --[[User:Divad27182|Divad27182]] ([[User talk:Divad27182|talk]]) 18:01, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I thought that too initially - the terrain features certainly seems identical (to scale) to the one at the start of the story. But something's bothering me; it's about the frame before we see they are back on a beach - they are already seated, so it's fair to assume they haven't moved, yet the terrain is different. By looking at the terrain, you could guess that maybe the terrain is inverted, which would then indicate that the frame with the beach in view is from a different angle than the previous frame. But for that to be the case, Cueball would have to be behind Megan on the previous frame, yet, their positions are unchanged on these frames. So, I don't know...

Wait, what? It looks like they are suddenly back at a beach that looks the same as the first one, just zoomed out. But before when the scene was presumably inverted, the terrain didn't look quite like that. If the scene really did get inverted, maybe they aren't actually on a beach right now, but the sea will eventually expand until it reaches them. Then again, we don't know if this is the same plane of space that the original beach was either. They were just walking to the right. The concept of space in this comic is confusing me right now. I wonder if this will make sense later. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.63.158|129.21.63.158]] 18:41, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

It appears that the camera perspective has changed. 1 - 970 are all perpendicular to the shoreline, with the water on the right, camera looking down the shore. 971-996 are shown parallel to the shore line, with the camera position apparently out over the water or standing at the shore, looking back toward land. (If the camera had maintained the original position, the characters would have simply gotten smaller as the walked away, but instead we got to see the walk across the frame while presumably following the shore.) In 997, the camera perspective just comes back around to be a profile shot again, looking down the shoreline, water once again on the right. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.183.156.9|65.183.156.9]] 19:40, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Near the end of the transcript, it says that at +847 Beret Girl drops in again, dragging something.

&amp;quot;How long can this go on?  I would say a very long time.  Currently, each day is filled mostly with a very few backgrounds used over several comics with only the characters moving -- not that difficult to produce -- and maybe a few lines of dialog, which also allows for the repetition of the background.

Is Randall playing with me? My script is collecting at 00,05,20,35,50 each hour but many times now I got this:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
969:00 41/09:00 f8a6414c334a71481e16428691fe8465098b2bae956e44727d0482c7632a84ff.png &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I'm getting ...a84ff from http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time.png, but the main http://xkcd.com/1190/ gives the current image. [[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 23:43, 4 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
The 00:00 UTC (8 pm EDT) update worked. [[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 00:02, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Has anyone noticed that the exact same identical image was re-used several times recently? If you go to http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/ and tell it to show differences from frame 1090, and then start clicking forward, the following frames are all exactly the same: 1094, 1097, 1101, 1103, 1107. Looking at http://xkcd.aubronwood.com/# you can then see that 1111 and 1113 are also the same. The rapid perspective change makes the animation appear to strobe. Could this be some strange attempt to illustrate something like an earthquake, or are they just re-using frames to avoid having to draw so many?

You can see it in the [http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/log.txt log for geekwagon], do an in page search (ctrl+f) for f8a6414c334a71481e16428691fe8465098b2bae956e44727d0482c7632a84ff.

== Hours ==&lt;br /&gt;
There seems to be a problem starting with today (Sunday, 2013-05-05): The first picture should be 984:00 and not 983:00. I'm not able to check if it's simply a bot (?) error writing down the hours or something more serious. --[[Special:Contributions/82.135.84.245|82.135.84.245]] 15:56, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hour 983 on image 1104 Saturday (23:00 UTC) also appears on image 1105 Sunday (00:00 UTC). The image numbers are correct, but the hour count appears to be off by 1 hour now.[[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 16:34, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Not all images do map to the hash ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I did run this great command posted here before on 13 April 2013:&lt;br /&gt;
 md5sum -b * | sort | uniq -w32 -D&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then I did rename all duplicates to image???_.png. After that I did download the hashes from here to image???.png and run the check again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First result is easy. Files are changed so md5sum for image002_ and image002 are different but content is the same. But 004 is wrong and I will update this one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 878341ab1f710e5832aa7ed5cfa66ed7 *image002_.png&lt;br /&gt;
 878341ab1f710e5832aa7ed5cfa66ed7 *image004_.png&lt;br /&gt;

Next duplicate is also easy because files are still the same:&lt;br /&gt;
 129721094a74fe94c723160991a1e704 *image427_.png&lt;br /&gt;

== Split the movie? ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The page is becoming impossible to load.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would suggest to split the movie into pieces, for instance by making a separate sub-page for each week (avoiding embarassing discussion on the most natural cutting point). Each week can have a separate description, seven-seconds animation, list of 7x24 pictures etc, and a link to the following and previous weeks.&lt;br /&gt;

:My only suggestion would be give it larger segments. I don't think it needs to be as small as a week - after all, it loaded fine for a very long time. Maybe approx. half a scene each?

Here is a possible breackdown structure where sequences are ~130 pictures long : (number of frames / Start frame number))&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Part 1 : Sand Castles&lt;br /&gt;
 (127) 001:  First sand castle&lt;br /&gt;
 (105) 128 : Second sand castle (180) and Catapulte&lt;br /&gt;
 (090) 233 : Joining castles&lt;br /&gt;
 (100) 323 : Miniature castle&lt;br /&gt;
 (116) 423 : Scaffold&lt;br /&gt;
 (131) 539 : Plattform&lt;br /&gt;
 (132) 670 : Fourth castle&lt;br /&gt;
 (173) 802 : Sea rising &amp;amp; fade out&lt;br /&gt;
Part 2 : Wildernesses&lt;br /&gt;
 (150) 975 : Seashore&lt;br /&gt;
 (100) 1125 : Rivershore&lt;br /&gt;
 (115) 1225 – : Hills&lt;br /&gt;
 (087) 1340 - 1363 – 1379 : Trees&lt;br /&gt;
 (124) 1427 : Baobabs&lt;br /&gt;
 1551 – 1581 Berries&lt;br /&gt;
 1619 – Squirrel&lt;br /&gt;
 1640 Berries&lt;br /&gt;
Suggestions that can be discussed :&lt;br /&gt;
* Sequences should be 100-150 pictures long (with possible exceptions).&lt;br /&gt;
* Even if the image is not that big, the length of the movie can be a problem when one wants to check for details : short sequences allow for a slower pace.&lt;br /&gt;
* Good cutting points would be : two consecutive identical pictures, changes of scenery. Sequences with the same theme should on the contrary be kept together when possible.&lt;br /&gt;

:This is not real life. And they know it's not real life. Maybe they are in some sort of Matrix and know about it, or they are playing a video game. They've seen in developers' blog that devs are working on a lot of new features for version 0.19, such as improved sand physics, multiple rivers, rain, salty water, trebuchets, swimming, surf, etc. But then developers decided to release part of these features in version 0.19, and leave the rest for 0.20. When Cueball an Megan saw that version 0.19 is out, they immediately decided to try it out, without even looking at the changelog. So they don't know which features made it into this version, and which ones will be in the next one. So far they have played around with new sand physics and trebuchets, tried swimming in the sea, tried to drink sea water, found a new river. They haven't seen any surf, so they think it'll be in 0.20. They have yet to try swimming in a river, or see the rain. They have also found a bug that causes sea level to raise indefinitely. They think it could be caused either by rain, additional rivers, or just by a griefer who built a giant sand generator array to fill in the sea and flood everything. Oh, and they can't just create a new private world to see if the sea raises there, because of the DRM.&lt;br /&gt;

Swimming in a river is dangerous if there's a strong current. Even slow moving water has a lot of power. The sea could be the ocean, connected to the ocean, or one of the large bodies of water referred to as a sea.

&lt;br /&gt;
We know: &amp;quot;The sea is big&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The river is small&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But we also know about the sea: There are no waves. It's just rising. So it is not an ocean, it's just a lake. Many people say &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; to a lake when they can not see the other side.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And we know their home river is small. But right now they explore a different bigger river.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We know it's not summer so maybe it is spring and the river is rising like every year?&lt;br /&gt;

It seems like the two river halves (or two rivers) merge as Megan and Cueball hike upstream. New point: I joined all the images covering their journey since image 1150 (last stop for water). it spans 18204 pixels. Assuming Cueball is 6 feet tall (wild guess + it's an even number), they have now hiked a total of 0.517 miles (83228.7 cm) from image 1150.[[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 13:32, 10 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Considering the elaborate and fragile sand castles, the one- and two-person construction of the platform and its castle components, and maybe the latest antics at the top of the dunes, it appears that gravity is not Earth-normal.  Or perhaps the law of gravitation is not our-universe-normal. (No reason it should be, of course.) [[User:Taibhse|Taibhse]] ([[User talk:Taibhse|talk]]) 03:11, 11 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Archive ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since this 1190 will never end, will it? I think we need some archive sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First could be &amp;quot;1190 Time Images 2013-03 March&amp;quot; (&amp;lt;- I am calling this human readable ISO)&lt;br /&gt;
So, if you understand, each month of picture links and hashes on a separate page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next would be &amp;quot;1190 Time Images 2013-04 April&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And a few months from now we also have to do this for the &amp;quot;Transcript&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;

:If this comic goes on forever, maybe. For now, we could probably compact the page by grouping the frames from each month into wider tables and scrapping their hashes. The hashes are really only useful for checking that we got the images right, so they're kinda useless for the really old ones.

:::::::I wasn't shouting, there is no need to bring ad hominem into this discussion. There are a number of solutions available here; we could tabulate frames per month as per [[explain_xkcd:Community_portal/Proposals#Time:_The_Table|this neglected post]], offload prior months to other pages, or scrap old hashes to cut a large portion of the article's body text. Each solution will lead to degradation of the explanation, splitting the article will force multiple page loads while removing the hash values will be destroying part of the metadata around the comic. Ideally, we wouldn't have to make the split at all, but speed considerations mean that we eventually will have to do it. In that eventuality, all we can do is the thing that degrades the explanation for the average visitor the least. What do visitors care more about, faster load times/having all the frames on one page or having 1000-odd incomprehensible and meaningless hash values? We don't display the individual filenames for Click and Drag even though they were more informative than the hashes here, because they hold little value to visitors; they only take up space that could be used to further enhance the explanation. Pure archival without curation is what other websites do, not a wiki with the intended goal of making xkcd accessible.

So Cueball and Megan seem to entering a region with much more vegetation. Up until now I had assumed that the previous regions had vegetation as well but Randall just hadn't bothered drawing it (such detail is rare in XKCD). So what does presence of vegetation mean? More rainfall? Higher elevation? Also how far have Cueball and Megan travelled? I don't think the frames are necessarily contiguous - if this was a movie we'd have background music to go with the images. They could have been travelling for days or weeks - I definitely don't think it is still the same day as the start of Act II. I suppose 'time' will tell.

The latest frame (1506) has two trees. They are almost certainly baobab trees. There are 8 species of baobab tree, but of those 8, 6 are endemic to the island of Madagascar, including the species which the trees in the comic most resemble, the Grandidier baobab. Even if they are not one of the six species endemic to Madagascar, the fact that they are baobabs still limits them to the continent of Africa, the countries of Oman and Yemen, and northwestern Australia. This means that the big sea, if it is an ocean, is most likely the Indian Ocean. [[Special:Contributions/76.92.118.150|76.92.118.150]] 18:30, 21 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== A hypothesis ==&lt;br /&gt;
Randall's animation is taking place in a distant, post-collapse future (&amp;quot;distant&amp;quot; is relative, here-- say sometime in the next few hundred years, though possibly much further): human civilization is back at a late-Iron Age stage of development, though maybe with slightly more sophisticated metallurgy. The reasons I suggest this are: 1) rising sea-level that is on-going, 2) they can work wood and they have agriculture, 3) they have shown no awareness of any more &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; technology, 4) yet they have no qualms about wandering off into the wilderness without what most of us would consider adequate protection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The one reason I might think it's farther into the future is the bit with the trees. I can't decide if their shape is a consequence of evolution (convergent, so that they are very similar to the {{w|Adansonia grandidieri}}), or they were transplanted (presumably to somewhere south? Higher altitude? Both? Antarctica?). Evolution would imply deeper in the future, and transplantation could be sooner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm really interested to see what the truth is, because it's got me thinking along all kinds of planes.[[Special:Contributions/184.99.231.23|184.99.231.23]] 21:38, 24 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

New clue, image 1692 - &amp;quot;Still, it's better than when we were following the sea, walking straight into the sun all morning.&amp;quot; Walking east along the sea, it places them on the south side of anything.

&lt;br /&gt;
This may be more speculation than not, but the two turned north to follow the river and are now walking on a heading somewhere between NE and NW, which puts them in the northern hemisphere if they can see their shadow in front of them. This is also confusing since there aren't many Grandidier's Baobab trees there [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia_grandidieri].[[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 20:46, 29 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I agree that these orientations are plausible from the dialog in the strip, but remember, we're already pretty certain that they're not in the same universe as us, so we may not be able to assume that the sun rises in the east. There's no evidence to demonstrate that their world rotates west-to-east like ours does, but there's no evidence that it doesn't, either. Let's at least remember the possibility that all of these directions are reversed from what our current theory states.

== The Planting People ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what do we know about them? They've been gone a while, long enough for Cueball to believe it was fine to take grapes.  But they haven't been gone for a long time, because we've seen a staked sapling that is likely only a year or two old. They have vineyards and what look to be orchards. They appear to use tents, at least the frame we saw looked to be tied together at the top to form a teepee frame. They are sophisticated enough to do things like put benches next to trees, so they aren't subsistence farmers. Anything else? [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 18:14, 28 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: Forgot a couple of things, they have what is possibly writing (are Cueball and Megan illiterate?), and it's different than that of the Hill People, but their debris appears to look the same.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They appear to be either hunter-gatherers or have abandoned the area (for some reason - why?). From [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomadic] &amp;quot;Many groups of 'nomadic' hunter-gatherers (also known as foragers) moved from campsite to campsite, following game and wild fruits and vegetables.&amp;quot; We have seen three campsites; Cueball burried the embers from their fire (see image 1048 &amp;amp; 1062-1064 [http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/?frame=1064]).

Go to a vineyard in late summer or early autumn, you will not see the &amp;quot;The Planting People&amp;quot;.

&lt;br /&gt;
== What do we know by the end of May 2013? ==&lt;br /&gt;
I'm trying to collect some facts:&lt;br /&gt;
:-They did build a sand castle and the weather was warm enough to swim in the sea. The taste of the water is bad, and the sea is raising.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Then both are trying to find a reason for that raise and they are starting to travel around this special river.&lt;br /&gt;
:-They are still going uphill while we never have seen that mountains.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Eating grapes from a vineyard means we are at least at late summer.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Walking to the sun in the morning is just walking to the east.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
They are also apparently now heading west, or mostly west.  Their shadows are in front of them, and while that could be west in the morning or east in the evening, they are contrasting it with walking into the sun in the morning as they were along the shore, so it's west. Presumably they were walking mostly north until the decision to head for the mountains, since Cueball has just started playing with his shadow. [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 00:50, 30 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:OK, but they are walking to the sun in the morning. That's east (on northern hemisphere, I still do not think we are at Madagascar). So we do have an other fact:&lt;br /&gt;
:-Around time frame 1700 it's evening.&lt;br /&gt;
--[[User:Dgbrt|Dgbrt]] ([[User talk:Dgbrt|talk]]) 17:07, 30 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:-If you walk into the sun, you are walking east.&lt;br /&gt;
:-They then turned to their left to go upriver. That's would be going north.&lt;br /&gt;
:-If you are above the tropics, your shadow will always lay to the north of you.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Megan says what they're doing is better than when they had to walk into the sun, and it's been established that they walked along the sea for days, so they'd be familiar with walking with the sun directly behind them, too. If they were now walking west, it would pretty much be the same situation, except reversed. It doesn't really make sense to me that she'd call one situation better than the other. It feels more like they aren't walking into the sun ''at all'' anymore. Therefore, I think they are now keeping the sun relatively behind them by going north, which indicates they are north of the equator, and probably north of the Tropic of Cancer. Even at noon, the sun would be behind you slightly, to the south. And if you're walking uphill, it would be very visible to you.&lt;br /&gt;

== Snake Theories ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Megan mentions snakes with spikes over their eyes. That covers several species, all poisonous, but they are native to the American west and southwest, Mexico, Central America, north Africa and the Middle East. The snake that Cueball finds might be a {{w|Anguis fragilis|slow-worm}}, a limbless reptile native to Eurasia. It's shiny, brown, has a blunt head, and can shed its tail like a lizard, which might give it a half-finished look if Cueball saw it that way. But a stronger contender is the {{w|rubber boa}}, which is native to the western US, and has a famously stubby head and tail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This makes me think of one area: The {{w|Great Salt Lake}}. The {{w|Bear River (Utah)|Bear River}} empties into it from a northerly direction, and the area has the rubber boa and at least one type of poisonous horned snake. Native Americans of the area even had legends of the Horned Serpent. And that ''had'' to be a teepee we saw earlier. (I don't think Native Americans had trebuchets or berets, though....) --[[User:Druid816|Druid816]] ([[User talk:Druid816|talk]]) 01:59, 2 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

I don't have the distances along the sea. The average speed, using 1 hr/frame update, is 0.0025 mph, 0.0041 kph (at 5 min/frame update the speed increases to 0.0304 mph).

:- thanks to [[User:Galois|Galois]] we do know they did climb approx. 65 meters (maybe slightly more because 6 feet or 1.8288 meters for Cueball is maybe a little bit too much).&lt;br /&gt;
:- they are still in real nature, the most technical devices we have seen is just wood.&lt;br /&gt;

I'd like to think Cueball is shorter, I used 6 ft because it's convenient and yields longer distances. The tallest Baobob tree is 516 px (rescaled to the running comic) = 77.4 ft (23.6 m) using a 6 ft Cueball. Note that using a 5.5 ft (1.7 m) Cueball, the tree drops to 71 ft (21.6 m). The Wikipedia page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia_grandidieri] on the Grandidier's baobab states they can reach 25 to 30 m (80-100 ft) in height, 23.6 m is about right.

As they leave one panel on the right, they enter the next on the left (and visa-verse for the trip back to the sunken castle).

::That's the way it was drawn. While Megan is still sleeping, Cueball takes a walk, gathers some berries, stops several times to look around, and then walks back to the tree. The walk and the tree scene probably don't connect directly. It appears that Cueball arises from under the tree, turns (left) away from the &amp;quot;camera&amp;quot; (frankly, I can't tell he is walking towards us or away from us... only Megan has hair, which tells us which way), and starts his walk.

Thumbnails are not working at this moment. But nevertheless I think it's not a good idea to include that large pictures. My idea:&lt;br /&gt;
:Create that big pictures, separated into some parts, remove Megan and Cueball and then change only the width to 1200 pixels. And one picture should cover all at the width of 1200 pixels. Scene 2 could be split into several collapsible parts with the terrain picture on top.

== Philosophical implications ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think the huge following that this comic has gathered - the amount of work by people like Aubron Wood and the guys at geekwagon, explainxkcd editors, general xkcd enthusiasts, the people at XKCD time wiki - raises some interesting questions. At this point we're not even clear how Randall is writing these comics: he may have designed them all from the start, or he may be writing 24 a day, going along with it, according to the natural progression of events and what has led up to now. It has interesting parallels with the {{w|design argument}}. It also makes you wonder about how it's all going to end. There are so many ongoing discussions - and have been from the start - about how the comic is going to conclude. Just as in real life we take so many different roads and never really know where we're going to end up. If we're continuing with the religious theme we could extend the metaphor even further, about what happens after we die. We don't know if we're going to just stop existing or if we're going to end up in some elaborate afterlife. We don't know what Randall's going to do - how long will the comic go on? Could it last his entire lifetime? We have no way of knowing. --[[User:Mynotoar|Mynotoar]] ([[User talk:Mynotoar|talk]]) 14:05, 8 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I believe Randall is writing this as it goes along, preparing the scenes only a little bit in advance. The story (quest?) reads more like a series of isolated vignettes, but with a few themes being carried forward, such as the quest for the source of the rising sea. I'm here in homage to Randall's unique wit and humor, and having fun trying to second guess what he'll do next. I don't believe the setting is an actual place, but we have several clues that limit its location. I see this as a collection of disparate objects and events; some go together, some not, but with some running themes. Randall may be making some points (such as conservation, ecology, and not eating squirrels); although, I would have never filled a canteen from the small river without first boiling or purifying the water. [[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 14:27, 8 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:Are you living in tent? People living in tents for big amount of year (as these two apparently do) generally tend to dring water without purifying.  .... on the other hand, those generally don't build castles from sand. And they DID mentioned steam bottle once ... -- [[User:Hkmaly|Hkmaly]] ([[User talk:Hkmaly|talk]]) 17:43, 9 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Stillness of air ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyone else notice how still the air is?  In the frames I have looked at, the grass never moves, so there must be no wind. [[Special:Contributions/174.27.36.133|174.27.36.133]] 12:20, 11 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Making extreme sport out waiting ==&lt;br /&gt;

Let's do [[1017]], but using current frame instead of a progress bar. &amp;lt;strike&amp;gt;[http://homepage.ntlworld.com./jonathan.deboynepollard/FGA/questions-with-yes-or-no-answers.html Does anyone know]&amp;lt;/strike&amp;gt; what formula should we use for this? Something similar to the one in [[1017] won't work, because we don't know when (if ever) the Time will end. I was thinking about T = c + n * (1 hour), where n is current frame and c is a couple of days before the beginning of Time, but it seems too boring. --[[User:DiEvAl|DiEvAl]] ([[User talk:DiEvAl|talk]]) 14:57, 11 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Madagascar theory ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm still not sure that it is supposed to be a specific place, but going with the Madagascar theory, there is indeed a native Madagascar hedgehog -- the greater and lesser tenrecs. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Still no squirrels, though. [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 20:58, 14 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:That Madagascar trees are also imported to US. Hedgehogs are a famous pets in US, even when they do belong to Asia and Europe. We are still in the US, and more precisely around Utah. --[[User:Dgbrt|Dgbrt]] ([[User talk:Dgbrt|talk]]) 21:51, 14 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:Hedgehogs are found in many places. From the shadow comments, they are on a northern sea coast in the northern hemisphere, hence probably not Madagascar. There's something wrong with every possible location I checked. The Mediterranean Sea is rising because the water coming in from rivers is greater than that lost through evaporation [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea#Sea-level_rise] and is polluted [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea#Pollution], BUT a quick check has every possible northern coast covered with cities or agriculture. I lived in Salt Lake City for a little while. Antelope Island has oolitic sand on the north and west sides and is a mountain, but no major rivers or waterfalls[http://www.utah.com/stateparks/great_salt_lake_facts.htm]. The north coast is a boggy delta, except for a peninsula, which is covered with agriculture. Southern Utah is a better match and has waterfalls, but no sea. I gave up. [[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 18:04, 15 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:: The sea thing is certainly a problem for any modern-day Utah theory, but the tree that recently came on-screen (frame 2145) could be intended to be ''Pinus longaeva'', which would be appropriate to Utah (or many other parts of the Great Basin), high altitudes, and the comic theme.  Oh, also, if you want a rising, large body of water near Southern Utah there's always Lake Mead.  But it's probably not so large as to be mistaken for the sea. --Joe Decker&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:: I'm not sure that current agriculture would be an issue. Unless they are play-acting or in some kind of _The Village_ setup, they seem unlikely to be current-day humans. They seem strangely ignorant of some obvious things and yet aware of others. There might be a few tribal peoples living in tents that would be unaware of the next river over, but they would be unlikely to be confused by birds nesting. Or be using trebuchets and European castle architecture in sandcastles. And if they genuinely walked for &amp;quot;days&amp;quot; along the shore, it seems unlikely to be a _The Village_ setup; that's got to be 20 miles even taking a leisurely trip for just two days, and probably more.

It might be interesting, however, that there's a striking resemblance between the Grandidier's Baobab depicted in the comic at frame 1525 {{geekwagon|1525}} and the tree on the left in the Wikimedia picture [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Adansonia_grandidieri03.jpg Grandidier's Baobab (Adansonia grandidieri) near Morondava, Madagascar].

:That place is surprisingly like the comic, especially when explored [[Expedition]] style. It has beaches, other rivers, baobabs, etc! And doesn't the fact that they slept overnight invalidate the northern hemisphere theory and mess with determining the walking direction by the sun? Despite all this, I doubt being in Madagascar does much for understanding the meaning of the comic. --[[User:Irino.|Irino.]] ([[User talk:Irino.|talk]]) 01:55, 17 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
If this is Madagascar, then it would be a fossa ... but the head looks too big and cat-like. Perhaps a juvenile cougar/puma?  Would help explain why it bit the backpack instead of Cueball's neck. Geographically, that or one of the ocelots / relatives would put us in South or North America. AH [[Special:Contributions/209.74.126.175|209.74.126.175]] 14:00, 21 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why is everyone assuming the location corresponds to an actual modern day location (e.g. Madagascar)? Given that http://xkcd.com/505/ is staged on an infinite plane full of rocks we shouldn't limit our search to the real, simply the rational.

:This doesn't make any sense. Rationals are (or are isomorphic to) a subfield of reals, so if we limit our search to rationals we also implicitly limit it to reals.

As we now know that they are in the Mediterranean region, a {{w|Eurasian lynx}} or an {{w|Iberian lynx}} look quite good guesses but the cat in the comic has a tail that is too long and it doesn't have ear tufts. I guess if it is far enough in the future, the distribution of animals could have changed, so it might be {{w|Caracal}} (desert lynx), a {{w|Serval}} or an {{w|African golden cat}}.

I'll take a shot... The bottom part is curved and aligns perfectly with Cueball's head in Photoshop, just cutoff on the left (and the right as it goes out of frame). The rounded slice at the top matches Megan's head as well. The full slice does not match any scene to date (the only one close is 1885 with Megan in the tree, but that's not it); thus, it must be a slice from a future scene (or maybe part of a template with assorted characters).

:::Reviewing further, I'm even more convinced. If you get a star map in the right orientation, you can see that the rest of Scorpio is becoming visible just above the horizon in {{geekwagon|2393}}.

And if we have that, the relative position of the sun to the stars should be sufficient to determine the day of the year (depending on the accuracy of the drawings) and probably, assuming the first bright dot was indeed Venus, we might even be able to determine if the story takes/took place this year. Maybe other astronomical objects show (or don't show) and help to further narrow down the '''time'''. --[[Special:Contributions/92.76.250.121|92.76.250.121]] 00:18, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
:From the position of the sun, Venus is at or close to greatest eastern elongation from the sun.  Assuming that the constellations we are looking at are Sagittarius and surroundings (and the new stars coming into view continue to match this), the sun is located around Virgo.  From the angle of the ecliptic, they are at 30 degrees north, and thus it would have to be around the beginning of November, as that's when Virgo sets with the sun at 30N. So it could be a year when Venus hits the greatest eastern elongation in late October/early November.  Which happens this year, but it can't be this year as the moon isn't right -- there would be a crescent moon next to Venus. It would have to be at new moon or waning moon, and that puts it after 2037. Of course, there are a lot of assumptions and estimations in that calculation. [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 02:29, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
::Actually, for the moon it could be 2029, but there's another blocking factor: Mars should be next to Venus in 2037.  And for the next few eight year cycles, some combination of Mercury, the moon, and Saturn should be showing up between Venus and the Sun before the stars do. So it looks like 2053 would be the first matching date. And the next date after that 2085 - it precesses forward a bit each year, so it would be Nov 12 by 2085.

I wandered over to the forum, and they agree with our conclusion of Sagittarius, and one of them had a interesting observation: Antares is gone. It should be the brightest thing in this view apart from Venus, and you can see the two stars that should flank it appear at {{geekwagon|2392}}, between Cueball's head and the tree, but no Antares. Which suggests that this is set sufficiently far in the future that Antares has gone supernova (which it is due to do.) [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 06:27, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
:Even more suggestive of a far future: certain of the stars in the Scorpion appear to have moved.  If you go to Hipparchos [[http://www.rssd.esa.int/SA-general/Projects/Hipparcos/apps/ShowMotion.html]] and enter RA 260.4, Dec -42, and V(lim) 4.4, you will get the stars in the head and part of the body of the Scorpion.

One last thing (for the moment): The angle of the sun and planets are what they should be for c. 30-33 degrees N, but to get the constellations angled the right way, it's closer to 12 degrees north. This may be precession, which could also explain the grapes in what would be currently by the stars the beginning of November -- the vernal equinox may have precessed forward, resulting in the sun being in Virgo/Libra in summer rather than fall. 15,000 years would put it in Libra in June, for example [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 16:27, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Where in the world are Megan and Cueball? ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Venus marking the path of the ecliptic tells us that we are at about 30 degrees north (my quick-ass calculation came up closer to 31 or 32 degrees north.) They are walking east with the ocean to the south of them, and they are following a large river north into hills and mountains that apparently are less than a day's walk north. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if it's Earth, where could they be? There's not a lot of south-facing coasts around 30N. The only large one is the Gulf Coast of the US, but there's not much in the way of hills much less anything you could call a mountain close to the shore. The only exception I can really see is maybe around Mobile, which at last has some hills. There's the north end of the Persian Gulf and of the Gulf of California, but for both of those the hills are east of of the most obvious large river.  Though the Gulf of California would make sense in other ways -- rivers that only run to the sea in the wet season, for example. There's South Korea, but the southern coast of that is broken up into a fringe of islands and peninsula, there's not really a solid stretch of coast to walk east along.  [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 00:14, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:If, as hypothesized above, this is taking place a few thousand years into the future, might not the coastlines have changed?  (Especially since the &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; seems to be rising.)  I wonder if we could find the proper configuration of hills and a mountain even in absence of a body of water to the south.

Someone mentioned the Clock of the Long Now, and the 10,000 Year Clock would fit in a number of ways.  The Texas original one is at the right latitude, and the Sierra Diablo mountains where it is are near a dried-up inland sea, which presumably could be a sea again, and an inland sea could rise much faster than the world's oceans.  And it would fit with the title &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot;, and explain the multi-thousand year future setting. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Has anyone been able to map exactly where the sun is on the stars? That would show where in the precession sequence we are. If it's in Libra, for example 15,000 years forward the sun would set in Libra around June at 31-32 degrees north at that point.  Which would explain the grapes and the camping without shelter.

== Meteor frames. ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There were five meteor frames that appeared in very quick succession recently. How should they be numbered?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:&amp;quot;appeared in very quick succession&amp;quot;: I assume they actually appeared on the hour, just like all the others (except for first days), &amp;lt;strike&amp;gt;and as they are currently listed in our table&amp;lt;/strike&amp;gt;? [[User:Markhurd|Mark Hurd]] ([[User talk:Markhurd|talk]]) 12:00, 9 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
::No, they appeared on the minute between 20:20 and 20:24 UTC on 29 June. That's how they're listed here. [[User:Crimethink|Crimethink]] ([[User talk:Crimethink|talk]]) 16:10, 9 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
[http://xkcd.mscha.org/#frame2440 mscha's site] numbers them 2440a to 2440e.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/?frame=2441 geekwagon] only has the final meteor frame (2440e) which it numbers 2441, and after that all the numbers on geekwagon are out by one compared to mscha's site. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another logical option is to number them from 2441 to 2445.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[http://xkcd.aubronwood.com/?i=2445&amp;amp;playing=0&amp;amp;audio=0&amp;amp;speed=200 aubronwood] has the frames numbered 2444 to 2448 (like the previous suggestion, but I think aubronwood had been out by three for a long time compared to other sites)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the [http://xkcd-time.wikia.com/wiki/Periods xkcd-time wiki] I have tentatively used mscha's numbering, which may be a problem considering the wiki has built-in linking to geekwagon.&lt;br /&gt;

I haven't done the exact calculations, but my impression from those we did that they have only climbed 300-400 cueball-heights, which would be only a couple of thousand feet.

It's the wrong end of the river for them to be building a dam, but I'm wondering, with all the surveying equipment, if they are diverting more water into the basin that Cueball and Megan live in.

Is this pair the Cueball and Meagan we've known from before? What impresses me is the level of ignorance this pair exhibits, compared to the couple we've come to know. This pair do not seem to understand oxygen starvation at higher altitudes, how tides work, etc. This almost flies in contradiction to the fact that, in the beginning, they were building sand castles. This presumes castles existed at some point in their own history if not currently. Castles indicate a certain level of knowledge and technology, which this current couple seem to lack knowledge of, to some large degree at least.&lt;br /&gt;
If this strip 'ends' at the level of technology we've seen thus far and hinted at by this new tribe of people, I would suggest this indicates a world wide (or at least very large area) collapse of a prior civilization.&lt;br /&gt;

I believe it's possible to translate their language into pervect english by simple replacing their symbols by roman letters (the right way). For &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; we have an example. ([[User talk:FG|talk]]) 17:12, 11 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
:What could the last word in {{geekwagon|2728}} be then? It ends the same way as &amp;quot;water&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;drink&amp;quot;, except for a ° instead of a ¯ over the last letter, but has an additional &amp;quot;3&amp;quot;-shaped letter at the beginning. I'm starting to believe that Randall put a bit more effort into designing this language. --[[User:Chtz|Chtz]] ([[User talk:Chtz|talk]]) 15:34, 11 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is clearly not a letter-per-letter cipher; I think Randall has been considerably cleverer than that. It looks like a (fictional) Semitic language, in which case individual characters could indicate syllables rather than letters, but I doubt that it is a simple cipher for English at the syllable level either. At this stage it is impossible to say how far he has gone in creating an original syntax, but I would note that we have seen the word that means &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;drink&amp;quot;) in at least two forms (a simple form used by Cueball, and a form with a kind of 3 at the beginning used as the last word of the Beanie's response to Cueball's picture). I'm confident the ¯ is simply a period, ° a question mark, and the double ¯ is an exclamation mark. The other stray marks could be other punctuation marks as well.

I just noticed that translator often puts a ° or ¯ above last letter in some sentences, just like in stranglish (did we come up with a better name for it yet?).

I suppose it is safe to assume that the black frame ({{geekwagon|2698}}) represents some indeterminate passage of time, since we do see Cueball now speaking the language of the Beanie-Wearers. What is strange, and perhaps it is just Randall being lazy, is that if you compare the frames before and after the black frame, there is absolutely no changes to vegetation, and very few changes to anything else. Vegetation would have been the biggest culprit to a lengthy time interval.

Megan started wearing a backpack after they left the tower. They lost Cueball's backpack when the animal clawed it up, so he carried everything in Megan's to keep weight off her leg.

== Who are they? ==&lt;br /&gt;
If the Great and Powerful OZ steps out from behind a curtain, I'll upchuck. Castles imply a need for defense, yet our adventurous pair and the 'natives' both seem totally relaxed with the discovery of the other. No obvious caution shown, no attempt to discover which side they may be on, etc. In fact, the 'natives' appear to be experienced with the finding of new people and following an established procedure for dealing with them, hence the trip to the castle. If Meagan and Cueball had declined to follow, what would have taken place then? Just a guess but I would say, nothing, each to their separate way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The one map view strongly suggests, to me, survey work using trigonometry (or some variation) to determine location. It would seem to be a case of figure the location first, get there, then see what you find. The greater and lesser circles are intriguing as well, along with the long, straight lines and other geometrical figures seen.

Not only that, if you look at the map which shows the channel, the location of the castle is highlighted and it does correspond to the location of Chateau D'If. --[[Special:Contributions/203.0.215.2|203.0.215.2]] 04:11, 19 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don't think there is any doubt.  The castle is the Chateau d'If.  The correspondence on the map to Marseille harbor is exact.  The map and the outline of the castle are pretty explicit, including the depiction of the Strait of Gibraltar as the &amp;quot;passage&amp;quot; between seas.  So if the level of the Atlantic is anywhere near our own, they will end up on the Île d'If.  If higher, who knows.

By the way, Cueball and Megan have walked quite a long distance.  On Hair Woman's map their home appears to be due south of If, same longitude, and roughly at the latitude of Sassari, Sardinia.  A minute of latitude is a nautical mile, essentially, and they walked a polygonal path, not a straight line north; a couple hundred nautical miles, at least.  That's a long walk.

&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming this is the Mediterranean sea[http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/medsea.htm], the predicted sea level map in frame 2907 shows that the Balearic Islands will become completely submerged. Since the highest point on the Balearic Islands is 1432 meters above sea level [http://www.islasbaleares.com/en/general-information-about-balearic-islands.html], and Chateau D'If isn't nearly as high, wouldn't Chateau D'If become completely submerged as well? Or maybe the Translator just omitted the Balearic Islands from the map. I'm guessing the latter is true.

:No, you're not the only one.  Megan reacted that way when Hair Woman asked them for their bags, for example.  Both our protagonists looked uncomfortable when she sent away the three individuals that had helped them and brought them to the castle.  And remember the hill people, and the discussion between M and C of the people on the mountain being -- maybe, hopefully -- different, since they are a long way from the hills.

&lt;br /&gt;
Did the learner/teacher/leader/ruler know the truth? She did some guesses and used a map that their people had found. I can't imagine their parents did travel 2.000 kilometers to Gibraltar, Megan and Cueball must have walked to a level more than 1.000 meters above their home, and also several hundreds of kilometers. A Cougar does not belong to Europe; they were walking to a higher level, running out of breath. At sea level? I'm pretty sure this story is still not solved.--[[User:Dgbrt|Dgbrt]] ([[User talk:Dgbrt|talk]]) 21:49, 20 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

There is a nice artist's conception of the Zanclean Flood at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Roger_Pibernat_-_landscape_-_messianic_med-1024x768.jpg [[User:Taibhse|Taibhse]] ([[User talk:Taibhse|talk]]) 05:45, 21 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
It's not quite the same configuration as Randall's sea basin, but similar.  The flood has its own wiki page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanclean_flood. I really do not think there is any doubt that Randall's story takes place in a far-future (possibly with liberties taken) Mediterranean Basin, and Hair Woman's castle is the Chateau d'If under restoration.  The original Messinian Salinity Crisis (q.v.) is estimated to have taken a thousand years or so to stabilize once the Gibraltar (and possibly other) passage(s) closed, presumably as a result of tectonic activity under the influence of the two opposing continental plates colliding at the site of the present Mediterranean Sea.  [[User:Taibhse|Taibhse]] ([[User talk:Taibhse|talk]]) 05:45, 21 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I do believe it quite likely that Hair Woman's people's ancestors/forbears already were spread as far west as Gibraltar, which would explain why her people know about the Atlantic seeping in, and then flowing, through the barrier.  She said they attempted to reinforce the barrier, but failed, so certainly they were there at Gibraltar in the &amp;quot;present time&amp;quot; of the story.  And to draw (&amp;quot;build&amp;quot; she said) the outlines on the map, they had to have information about the second sea basin on the other side of Italy-Sardinia and the outlines of what we call the Adriatic, etc.  [[User:Taibhse|Taibhse]] ([[User talk:Taibhse|talk]]) 05:45, 21 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== PNG time chunks changed on the xkcd server ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The images mirrored http://xkcd.mscha.org/ and those served by xkcd servers differs in two PNG 'tEXt' chunks with keywords 'date:create' and 'date:modify', which appears to contain the original timestamps.  Images from mscha.org have wide range of these timestamps, indicating that the images weren't produced all at the same time. But the same frames downloaded from xkcd servers now have their time values set to &amp;quot;2013-05-01T15:11:05-04:00&amp;quot;, so either mscha or xkcd must have modified the PNGs. The compressed image data seems to be modified, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also note that the copy of the first frame found at mscha.org has been edited by Photoshop, because the PNG structure is different from all the others and contains a color profile beginning with &amp;quot;Photoshop ICC profile&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;

The good news is, Megball can save about a third of the distance by their direct path through the hills.

It certainly was a sculptable medium anyway) was implied to be underwater in the three frames with the rocking bucket on the waves.

Cueball is concerned that the water is fresh.  Although this may seem to disprove the theory that the Atlantic is flooding into the Mediterranean, it actually doesn't. Notice that Cueball &amp;quot;felt&amp;quot; that something was strange.  What was strange was that they were accustomed to an extremely salty sea. Can you imagine filling up the Mediterranean Sea with ocean water then cutting it off from the Atlantic and allowing it to evaporate down to the size of C&amp;amp;M's sea?  It would be extremely salty and you could float easily in it. The water from the Atlantic Ocean is nowhere near that salty so Cueball interprets it as fresh water. This will cause problems with the rescue because these people are not used to swimming in water that's not super salty.  They can't float like they're used to and risk drowning.

:My thought too. He does say &amp;quot;Not as fresh as a river&amp;quot;, which means it's still salty, but much less so than the sea they're used to. I'm reminded of the Dead Sea, which also has a very high salinity. This makes the water tasting and spluttering in the beginning (while building the sand castle) make a lot of sense. I guess I have to go back and read it all again now that we have some context.  ~Therrufying [[Special:Contributions/83.233.5.126|83.233.5.126]] 18:36, 23 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

The picture does chance with time. The URL includes a changing timestamp that I can't decipher. Compare these two URLS (which have slightly different images:&lt;br /&gt;

Perhaps there is a way to hack the URL to view future images. [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:29, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I would also like to add that knowing randall, these are not the only images. For all we know, the image will still be changing in 5 years while a tree grows in front of them.

&lt;br /&gt;
Likely there is a way to hack the URLs; they look like some sort of hash, probably a hashed timestamp. Of course, he could easily have added some salt to the hash, making it significantly *harder* to hack. But they're strings of a specific length, so it should be pretty easy to bruteforce it, fetch all the images, and then (maybe) reverse-engineer the sequence. *That* all depends on how many of them there are.

:: The URLs are 64 hex characters. If he doesnt want us to find these pictures ahead of time, he would have made them completely random data, not a hash of anything. There are 16 possibilites for hex characters so 16^64 combinations or 1.7x10^308 combinations. If we made a supercomputer to try a billion links per second, and if there are 10,000 images total, it would take 4×10^277 × 13.77 billion years, which is a number with 277 zeros times the age of the universe to find just the first additional image. The sun will expand into a red giant and engulf the earth or at least come close enough to boil off all the water in the oceans in a mere 5.4 billion years, less than even one additional age of the universe.

: Given that the images switch back and forth between other images already seen, and that the comic should be viewable in the future, it seems unlikely that it's any thing like a simple sha256 of part of the timestamp.

Hash appears to be SHA-256. I tried some obvious hashes (&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;11901&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190_1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190.1&amp;quot;) to no avail.

Regarding sha256. Its most likely some hash of a timestamp, but if he doesnt wants us to crack it, he would have prefixes a password.. sha256('secretcode17:30'). Im just saying, if he doesnt wants us to crack it, we most likely cant.&lt;br /&gt;
I've tested all unixtimestamps from 1300000000 to 1364390334. Also &amp;quot;00:00&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;23:59&amp;quot;, with and without the colon and a load of other formats. {{unsigned|77.243.128.133}}&lt;br /&gt;

Alright, this is probably not going to work, but I'm trying to exploit Randall's awesomeness here. Maybe he decided to take the time-stamps from the user? I don't know if that's even possible... That would then allow people in different time zones to obtain different images simultaneously. (What's the corollary of Godwin's law for a bunch of math-and-science nerds and relativity? Is there one?) Clicking the img src url on the comic's html page, give me this: http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/752687b61523144c61736cd89f8c153dc41e19128f72d78d44947ff800f057fa.png : Never mind.. apparently others see the same image too.&lt;br /&gt;

For those wondering about the Javascript behind this: I posted my analysis of the Javascript [http://www.echochamber.me/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=101043&amp;amp;start=760#p3303579 on the xkcd forums], and further de-obfuscated and annotated the code over on [https://gist.github.com/cincodenada/5246094 GitHub].  Here's a quick summary though: it holds open a connection to xkcd's servers and listens for instructions and follows them. Those instructions are either &amp;quot;load a new image&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;reload the page&amp;quot;. So, you don't have to mash F5, it will automatically update the image when they're available. We have no way to control how fast the images come or when they do, and it's quite possible for them to update forever. --[[User:Fiveofoh|Fiveofoh]] ([[User talk:Fiveofoh|talk]]) 06:41, 27 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

This is a series of animation frames.

Call me a paranoid, but I think this strip is all about 9/11:&lt;br /&gt;
*If you read the strip number (1190) backwards, you get 09/11&lt;br /&gt;
*This subject is recurrent on xkcd&lt;br /&gt;
*As far as we have seen, there is a destroyed tower and they are rebuilding it&lt;br /&gt;
*The next strip, following 1190 (or 09/11), mentions war against countries with large oil reserves but low military capacity. {{unsigned|143.107.105.14}}&lt;br /&gt;
:I feel like that's kind of a stretch, I'm pretty sure it's just a story about a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If a new strip goes up every 30 minutes our time, and if each strip comprises of, let's say for the sake of simplicity, one minute in their time; to build the sand castle [frames 24-117 = 93 frames] so far it's taken almost 2 days our time, which would be about an hour and a half their time if each frame is a minute.  Using my scale, an hour our time is 2 minutes their time, a day is 48 minutes, and our month is their 24 hour day.  If we assume Randall plans to give us a 24 hour period from that world's time, and we use the minute-per-frame rate I made up, than we'd probably be looking at a month of images our time.  I guess we'll just have to see how long he's got it planned to go on. -boB&lt;br /&gt;

Has it ended? All that's left is the sandcastle, and there doesn't seem to have been anything else changed on it for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;

It's zooming out! When look at the gifs showing the frames in succession, the last 3 show the castle getting slightly smaller each time!&lt;br /&gt;

Strange: As far as I know http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time.png always redirects to the current frame. But if you visit the current one (133:00) at http://xkcd.com/1190/ and check the displayed image, it says 'c6976fbb244af4fc2286ffe3ac2cf78d408c1f610ecd71e18b4a677a048f084d.png' while time.png redirects to '1d9ce7199935b1b629d6b8744e62c7700a3780357b2dc74bb70471db616ddadb.png'.

&lt;br /&gt;
I'm seeing some strange stuff now. I have a script that uses wget of time.png to get the redirected hash png like Lockyy is doing. And I can verify that when you go to the 1190 page in the browser you get a different hash. But the previous hour and this hour, unlike the ones before it, the two hash pngs are different. And when I refresh the screen in my browser at the 1190 page, first I see the image I get from time.png, then the image refreshes with the other one. I'm not sure what this means or what we are supposed to do with it. I added the time.png hashes to the table for the last two hours but we probably need a way of indicating the difference. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 20:38, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

: Looking at it some more, I see that wget of the page at xkcd.com/1190/ gets you an img link to time.png and then there is the javascript that must after some delay get the different hash url image. That means that we had better be sure that we do not miss any manual checks of hourly updates because the scripts will never find that second image unless someone has a way of getting a script that runs the javascript as if it was a browser. As long as someone posts the hash of the image from the browser every hour, I can ensure that we have the hashes the scripts can get because I have a cron job checking for those updates every 15 minutes. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 21:49, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

When Megan coughed and Cueball asked if she was okay, did anyone else think of http://xkcd.com/931/ Lanes? Cueball explains that cancer treatment results are not known until much later, &amp;quot;and often the first sign is a cough or a bone pain.  So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry . . . .&amp;quot; ~~wrybred&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:I don't want to be a downer but this is just my interpretation thus far. I hope it is a happier theme but if you are correct wrybred, my further explanation would be the following... I think that building sandcastles is an analogy for living their life. Going for a swim in the body of water and the cough could represent the start of the cancer or possibly some time where they had to go out and &amp;quot;wade&amp;quot; in the possibilities of what cancer could mean. Time passes and Cueball says &amp;quot;I don't think we can build it much taller than this. It's been fun, though&amp;quot; which represents that they believe they have done as well as they can with the lives they have been given. They comment on the river retreating even though we the audience observe a body of water on the right hand side rising could represent how we can be fooled into believing things are going alright when in reality they are not. The reference to not understanding what the river is doing also fits this explanation well as someone with cancer may occasionally feel confused about their illness. Presently while I write this they are possibly preparing for a flood which represents the return of the cancer. If I were to guess what is next I might guess that they will watch as the flood comes in and destroys some of what they built but it is better than not having made the sandcastle in the first place. I could be way off, but Randall has given us a lot of TIME to think about what this is all about and your mind wanders. I also would note that this may not be about a particular cancer story, just any cancer story. [[User:Nhoel|Nhoel]] ([[User talk:Nhoel|talk]]) 13:51, 8 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Lending some weight to the 2D or nearly 2D nature is that the first platform they put up was installed on only two posts. But the platform itself had width.

I'm guessing that the water will keep rising indefinitely, and we'll be left with an upward-moving strip that occasionally zooms out as the bottom layers are very slowly filled in with black &amp;quot;water.&amp;quot; One thing that would make this interesting is the varying heights of the constructed structures (sandcastle turrets, platform, etc.) which would make the process of &amp;quot;overflow&amp;quot; from the right-hand side interesting to watch. {{unsigned ip|65.96.75.37}}&lt;br /&gt;

Oh the symbolism of it: Cueball leaves, Megan finishes building their castle, rests and lets her guard down.

I'm expecting the lower level-castle to be swept away by the water, while the high-level castle will remain intact. This is quite reasonable, assuming Cueball and Megan knows how high the flood will come and thus they built the platform to an appropriate height. It may be interpreted as the lower-level castle being the work of our life, which is inevitable finite, and will be eventually overtaken by death. Recognizing this, some choose to build a castle for the &amp;quot;after-life&amp;quot;. Life-death reflections have been common on xkcd in the past as well. {{unsigned ip|149.241.18.229}}&lt;br /&gt;

For me, this is clearly about cancer and the impacts it has on a relationship over time. Randall's now wife was diagnosed and treated for cancer recently and through this comic, he's trying to portray the anxious wait they faced through treatment and remission.  He has put us into his shoes by keeping us waiting in suspense to see how things end up.  The passing of time represents their life together.  At first it's just them relaxing together, probably the dating phase.  Soon they start building a life together, represented by the sand castle.  The castle evolves over time, much like their life has.  Difficulties and gaffes in their relationship are depicted, for example when cueball trips and breaks down part of the wall.  Eventually all efforts are diverted and put into defending against the approaching sea, which represents the cancer.  The wall, the platform, all represent the steps taken to prevent and/or prepare for it's impending progress.  The river represents the cure for cancer, which is still pretty far out, as cueball mentioned.  There are many many more clues I see and explanations I can give to support this idea (castle in the sky, the rain, progress with research, etc.), but this is just starting point.

:You make a good case, and much of the dialog supports that interpretation.  Many of us must have been thinking along the same lines.  A couple of points...there doesn't have to be only one meaning for the symbolism.  Also, there doesn't have to be an &amp;quot;end.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

The cancer metaphors are quite intriguing, but my take is environmental, possibly pollution and global warming. The French girl (beret) could be a nod to the Disneyland Paris castle.

I'm taking it that &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; is a phonetic substitute for &amp;quot;c,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;meaning &amp;quot;cancer.&amp;quot;  For better or worse, this kind of phoenetic clue was used in the Batman movie:&lt;br /&gt;

Well, I don't know if the intention here is that the &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; is making the &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; grow.  My point is that the dialogue is so nonsensical at points that it seems to be code.  I'm taking every noun as a metaphor for something.  &amp;quot;Sea&amp;quot; being &amp;quot;cancer&amp;quot; seems to fit (&amp;quot;The cancer can't make more of itself forever, can it?&amp;quot;)  I guess go back through the dialogue and see what other words could substitute for what they're saying.  Like I said, I don't know what &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;rain&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ground&amp;quot; could be in this metaphor.

I think this is the last day.  It's been exactly a month, they seem pretty done with it, and tomorrow's friday....On top of that, the most recent comic was the flipping of a switch on a time machine, in which, something happened, but we don't yet know what....it may be that the &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; comic is being refreshed.  ...Just a thought....

I agree - the water has started eroding the castle to the right, and it makes sense for the erosion to potentially loop the comic back to frame 1. That said, the title text was &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;. This could be a euphamism suggesting &amp;quot;keep waiting, this comic changes&amp;quot;, but it does have an implication that there is a &amp;quot;finale&amp;quot; to the comic that you should wait for.

The most recent event is Megan walking in, saying &amp;quot;bye!&amp;quot; in *lower case*, and leaving.  From the lower case, which is different from the rest of the comic, I infer that she was talking to *us*, not (eg) herself or the sandcastle!  I reckon it's just going to fill up with water until the page is a static black rectangle. Especially since she and Cueball just talked about going off and exploring, grabbed their bags, and left. -cosmogoblin [[Special:Contributions/94.197.127.235|94.197.127.235]] 13:57, 26 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

: I suspect the small text was to show a &amp;quot;small voice&amp;quot; - talking quietly and sadly perhaps?

:: I agree with the small voice. The sea level is still rising, and interestingly, the sand barrier on the far right is eroding on *both sides* -- not just the seaward side, as previously.

::: The &amp;quot;both-sides&amp;quot; erosion is normal and realistic.

I don't see this as a comic in a comic -- I see it more as act 2 (after the fadeout of act 1, with the stage crew jumping the gun and being caught on camera heading on stage to change the set).  Theoretically, this second act can be as long as the first one -- The Quest for the Source of the River/Sea.  (Hmmm, that reminds me of the song &amp;quot;River in the Sea&amp;quot; from the musical Ten November, a 2 minute sample available at http://www.prudencejohnson.com/sounds/gales/River_in_the_Sea.mp3).

Just wanted to say: I don't think the beret girl is a girl at all. It's a boy with an old-fashioned navy-style cap. Popular with boys at the beach (in the old days). See images here (http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x130/JTMarcus/h1.jpg) and here (http://cabinetcardgallery.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/kidwithcap_0003.jpg) I also like the fact that, just before the castle completely fades away, you can barely see the little boy bringing more materials (maybe another support beam?) to continue the work.&lt;br /&gt;
I like the continuity of letting the beret boy (not girl)&lt;br /&gt;
: Wether it's a navy cap or not may be open to interpretation (though I'd still bet it's a beret - it surely looks a lot more like the one the beret guy wears, and I think Randall would have put a little more effort into that detail if he wanted it to pass off as a navy cap). As for it being a boy, no. It's definitely a girl, you can clearly see it has a longer hair, and come to think of it, Randall rarely draws any hair at all for male characters anyway. --[[Special:Contributions/201.53.213.201|201.53.213.201]] 23:36, 29 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

I am hoping that this &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; somehow connects to the [http://xkcd.com/1110/ &amp;quot;Click and Drag&amp;quot;] comic i.e. when the camera zoom out far enough, we'll see that they are actually in the &amp;quot;Click and Drag&amp;quot; world. --[[Special:Contributions/98.14.191.109|98.14.191.109]] 23:59, 29 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Odd, it looks like +861, +862, and +863 are out of order, judging by the ground not changing at all and the characters not walking continuously.

During the last glacial period the sea level was more than 100 meters lower than it is nowadays, so coastal structures looked very different and the continents exposed much more land. I believe the first act of this comic references medieval ages in Europe where people would witness (over the scope of hundreds of years or longer) losing land and coastal towns to the sea but not understanding the process, as Megan states. I'm expecting the second act, and possibly further acts, to reference the abundance of scientifical discoveries made during the last few centuries.

Well, they've made it back to the beach.  I think it will end either at 1000 or 1024, and the only reason it might go to 1024 is allow some dialog and zooming in. :-)  --[[User:Divad27182|Divad27182]] ([[User talk:Divad27182|talk]]) 18:01, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I thought that too initially - the terrain features certainly seems identical (to scale) to the one at the start of the story. But something's bothering me; it's about the frame before we see they are back on a beach - they are already seated, so it's fair to assume they haven't moved, yet the terrain is different. By looking at the terrain, you could guess that maybe the terrain is inverted, which would then indicate that the frame with the beach in view is from a different angle than the previous frame. But for that to be the case, Cueball would have to be behind Megan on the previous frame, yet, their positions are unchanged on these frames. So, I don't know... I'll stop rambling now, and just wait and see, I guess... --[[User:Fernandofig|Fernandofig]] ([[User talk:Fernandofig|talk]]) 18:27, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Wait, what? It looks like they are suddenly back at a beach that looks the same as the first one, just zoomed out. But before when the scene was presumably inverted, the terrain didn't look quite like that. If the scene really did get inverted, maybe they aren't actually on a beach right now, but the sea will eventually expand until it reaches them. Then again, we don't know if this is the same plane of space that the original beach was either. They were just walking to the right. The concept of space in this comic is confusing me right now. I wonder if this will make sense later. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.63.158|129.21.63.158]] 18:41, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

It appears that the camera perspective has changed. 1 - 970 are all perpendicular to the shoreline, with the water on the right, camera looking down the shore. 971-996 are shown parallel to the shore line, with the camera position apparently out over the water or standing at the shore, looking back toward land. (If the camera had maintained the original position, the characters would have simply gotten smaller as the walked away, but instead we got to see the walk across the frame while presumably following the shore.) In 997, the camera perspective just comes back around to be a profile shot again, looking down the shoreline, water once again on the right. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.183.156.9|65.183.156.9]] 19:40, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Near the end of the transcript, it says that at +847 Beret Girl drops in again, dragging something.

&amp;quot;How long can this go on?  I would say a very long time.  Currently, each day is filled mostly with a very few backgrounds used over several comics with only the characters moving -- not that difficult to produce -- and maybe a few lines of dialog, which also allows for the repetition of the background.  He can probably keep this pace for months.  It would be a bit disappointing, but possible.  The strip certainly doesn't seem to be approaching any sort of conclusion.

Looking at http://xkcd.aubronwood.com/# you can then see that 1111 and 1113 are also the same. The rapid perspective change makes the animation appear to strobe.

Why are images 2816 and 2817 the same? http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/?frame=2816 http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/?frame=2817 [[Special:Contributions/121.72.166.59|121.72.166.59]] 21:56, 16 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Hours ==&lt;br /&gt;
There seems to be a problem starting with today (Sunday, 2013-05-05): The first picture should be 984:00 and not 983:00. I'm not able to check if it's simply a bot (?) error writing down the hours or something more serious. --[[Special:Contributions/82.135.84.245|82.135.84.245]] 15:56, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hour 983 on image 1104 Saturday (23:00 UTC) also appears on image 1105 Sunday (00:00 UTC). The image numbers are correct, but the hour count appears to be off by 1 hour now.[[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 16:34, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Not all images do map to the hash ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I did run this great command posted here before on 13 April 2013:&lt;br /&gt;
 md5sum -b * | sort | uniq -w32 -D&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then I did rename all duplicates to image???_.png. After that I did download the hashes from here to image???.png and run the check again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First result is easy. Files are changed so md5sum for image002_ and image002 are different but content is the same. But 004 is wrong and I will update this one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 878341ab1f710e5832aa7ed5cfa66ed7 *image002_.png&lt;br /&gt;

== Split the movie? ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The page is becoming impossible to load.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would suggest to split the movie into pieces, for instance by making a separate sub-page for each week (avoiding embarassing discussion on the most natural cutting point). Each week can have a separate description, seven-seconds animation, list of 7x24 pictures etc, and a link to the following and previous weeks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Any objection / comment / suggestion ? [[User:Biem|Biem]] ([[User talk:Biem|talk]]) 05:16, 8 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:My only suggestion would be give it larger segments. I don't think it needs to be as small as a week - after all, it loaded fine for a very long time. Maybe approx. half a scene each? Scene 1 is 971 frames long, so how about split at 500, at 971, and again at 1500 (when it gets there)? [[Special:Contributions/24.129.75.17|24.129.75.17]] 08:12, 8 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
::It's one and a half megabytes.

When the image starts clocking in at ~4-5 megabytes, it'll probably get to be a proper problem for those on poor connections, but we're not quite there yet.

Here is a possible breackdown structure where sequences are ~130 pictures long : (number of frames / Start frame number))&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Part 1 : Sand Castles&lt;br /&gt;
 (127) 001:  First sand castle&lt;br /&gt;
 (105) 128 : Second sand castle (180) and Catapulte&lt;br /&gt;
 (090) 233 : Joining castles&lt;br /&gt;
 (100) 323 : Miniature castle&lt;br /&gt;
 (116) 423 : Scaffold&lt;br /&gt;
 (131) 539 : Plattform&lt;br /&gt;
 (132) 670 : Fourth castle&lt;br /&gt;
 (173) 802 : Sea rising &amp;amp; fade out&lt;br /&gt;
Part 2 : Wildernesses&lt;br /&gt;
 (150) 975 : Seashore&lt;br /&gt;
 (100) 1125 : Rivershore&lt;br /&gt;
 (115) 1225 – : Hills&lt;br /&gt;
 (087) 1340 - 1363 – 1379 : Trees&lt;br /&gt;
 (124) 1427 : Baobabs&lt;br /&gt;
 1551 – 1581 Berries&lt;br /&gt;
 1619 – Squirrel&lt;br /&gt;
 1640 Berries&lt;br /&gt;
Suggestions that can be discussed :&lt;br /&gt;
* Sequences should be 100-150 pictures long (with possible exceptions).&lt;br /&gt;
* Even if the image is not that big, the length of the movie can be a problem when one wants to check for details : short sequences allow for a slower pace.&lt;br /&gt;
* Good cutting points would be : two consecutive identical pictures, changes of scenery. Sequences with the same theme should on the contrary be kept together when possible.&lt;br /&gt;

:This is not real life. And they know it's not real life. Maybe they are in some sort of Matrix and know about it, or they are playing a video game. They've seen in developers' blog that devs are working on a lot of new features for version 0.19, such as improved sand physics, multiple rivers, rain, salty water, trebuchets, swimming, surf, etc. But then developers decided to release part of these features in version 0.19, and leave the rest for 0.20. When Cueball an Megan saw that version 0.19 is out, they immediately decided to try it out, without even looking at the changelog. So they don't know which features made it into this version, and which ones will be in the next one. So far they have played around with new sand physics and trebuchets, tried swimming in the sea, tried to drink sea water, found a new river. They haven't seen any surf, so they think it'll be in 0.20. They have yet to try swimming in a river, or see the rain. They have also found a bug that causes sea level to raise indefinitely. They think it could be caused either by rain, additional rivers, or just by a griefer who built a giant sand generator array to fill in the sea and flood everything. Oh, and they can't just create a new private world to see if the sea raises there, because of the DRM.&lt;br /&gt;

Swimming in a river is dangerous if there's a strong current. Even slow moving water has a lot of power. The sea could be the ocean, connected to the ocean, or one of the large bodies of water referred to as a sea.

&lt;br /&gt;
We know: &amp;quot;The sea is big&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The river is small&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But we also know about the sea: There are no waves. It's just rising. So it is not an ocean, it's just a lake. Many people say &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; to a lake when they can not see the other side.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And we know their home river is small. But right now they explore a different bigger river.&lt;br /&gt;

We know it's not summer so maybe it is spring and the river is rising like every year?&lt;br /&gt;

It seems like the two river halves (or two rivers) merge as Megan and Cueball hike upstream. New point: I joined all the images covering their journey since image 1150 (last stop for water). it spans 18204 pixels. Assuming Cueball is 6 feet tall (wild guess + it's an even number), they have now hiked a total of 0.517 miles (83228.7 cm) from image 1150.[[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 13:32, 10 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Considering the elaborate and fragile sand castles, the one- and two-person construction of the platform and its castle components, and maybe the latest antics at the top of the dunes, it appears that gravity is not Earth-normal.

Since this 1190 will never end, will it? I think we need some archive sites.&lt;br /&gt;

First could be &amp;quot;1190 Time Images 2013-03 March&amp;quot; (&amp;lt;- I am calling this human readable ISO)&lt;br /&gt;
So, if you understand, each month of picture links and hashes on a separate page.&lt;br /&gt;

Each solution will lead to degradation of the explanation, splitting the article will force multiple page loads while removing the hash values will be destroying part of the metadata around the comic. Ideally, we wouldn't have to make the split at all, but speed considerations mean that we eventually will have to do it. In that eventuality, all we can do is the thing that degrades the explanation for the average visitor the least. What do visitors care more about, faster load times/having all the frames on one page or having 1000-odd incomprehensible and meaningless hash values? We don't display the individual filenames for Click and Drag even though they were more informative than the hashes here, because they hold little value to visitors; they only take up space that could be used to further enhance the explanation. Pure archival without curation is what other websites do, not a wiki with the intended goal of making xkcd accessible.

So Cueball and Megan seem to entering a region with much more vegetation. Up until now I had assumed that the previous regions had vegetation as well but Randall just hadn't bothered drawing it (such detail is rare in XKCD). So what does presence of vegetation mean? More rainfall? Higher elevation? Also how far have Cueball and Megan travelled? I don't think the frames are necessarily contiguous - if this was a movie we'd have background music to go with the images. They could have been travelling for days or weeks - I definitely don't think it is still the same day as the start of Act II. I suppose 'time' will tell.

Here's another example of the slightly 'strange' way of talking: &amp;quot;I'm surprised we haven't been seen by any people yet&amp;quot;. Wouldn't most people say: &amp;quot;I'm surprised we haven't seen any people yet&amp;quot;? So who are 'people'? Are 'people' somehow invisible to both Cueball and Megan? Are 'people' a threat?

The latest frame (1506) has two trees. They are almost certainly baobab trees. There are 8 species of baobab tree, but of those 8, 6 are endemic to the island of Madagascar, including the species which the trees in the comic most resemble, the Grandidier baobab. Even if they are not one of the six species endemic to Madagascar, the fact that they are baobabs still limits them to the continent of Africa, the countries of Oman and Yemen, and northwestern Australia. This means that the big sea, if it is an ocean, is most likely the Indian Ocean. [[Special:Contributions/76.92.118.150|76.92.118.150]] 18:30, 21 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Regarding the accuracy, I imagine Randall may have used a data model of countoured landscape (1D ''or'' 2D, plus height) to auto-generate the scrolling/panning/rotating scenery base prior to decorating with figures/etc, but whether there's enough information to fully back-derive such a map from the ever-changing landscape I couldn't say.

== A hypothesis ==&lt;br /&gt;
Randall's animation is taking place in a distant, post-collapse future (&amp;quot;distant&amp;quot; is relative, here-- say sometime in the next few hundred years, though possibly much further): human civilization is back at a late-Iron Age stage of development, though maybe with slightly more sophisticated metallurgy. The reasons I suggest this are: 1) rising sea-level that is on-going, 2) they can work wood and they have agriculture, 3) they have shown no awareness of any more &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; technology, 4) yet they have no qualms about wandering off into the wilderness without what most of us would consider adequate protection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The one reason I might think it's farther into the future is the bit with the trees. I can't decide if their shape is a consequence of evolution (convergent, so that they are very similar to the {{w|Adansonia grandidieri}}), or they were transplanted (presumably to somewhere south? Higher altitude? Both? Antarctica?). Evolution would imply deeper in the future, and transplantation could be sooner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This may be more speculation than not, but the two turned north to follow the river and are now walking on a heading somewhere between NE and NW, which puts them in the northern hemisphere if they can see their shadow in front of them.

&lt;br /&gt;
I agree that these orientations are plausible from the dialog in the strip, but remember, we're already pretty certain that they're not in the same universe as us, so we may not be able to assume that the sun rises in the east. There's no evidence to demonstrate that their world rotates west-to-east like ours does, but there's no evidence that it doesn't, either.

== The Planting People ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what do we know about them? They've been gone a while, long enough for Cueball to believe it was fine to take grapes.  But they haven't been gone for a long time, because we've seen a staked sapling that is likely only a year or two old. They have vineyards and what look to be orchards. They appear to use tents, at least the frame we saw looked to be tied together at the top to form a teepee frame. They are sophisticated enough to do things like put benches next to trees, so they aren't subsistence farmers. Anything else?

They appear to be either hunter-gatherers or have abandoned the area (for some reason - why?).

Go to a vineyard in late summer or early autumn, you will not see the &amp;quot;The Planting People&amp;quot;. We only know that we are at this particular season because they can eat grapes from that plants and before they could swim in the sea.

== What do we know by the end of May 2013? ==&lt;br /&gt;
I'm trying to collect some facts:&lt;br /&gt;
:-They did build a sand castle and the weather was warm enough to swim in the sea. The taste of the water is bad, and the sea is raising.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Then both are trying to find a reason for that raise and they are starting to travel around this special river.&lt;br /&gt;
:-They are still going uphill while we never have seen that mountains.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Eating grapes from a vineyard means we are at least at late summer.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Walking to the sun in the morning is just walking to the east.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
They are also apparently now heading west, or mostly west.  Their shadows are in front of them, and while that could be west in the morning or east in the evening, they are contrasting it with walking into the sun in the morning as they were along the shore, so it's west. Presumably they were walking mostly north until the decision to head for the mountains, since Cueball has just started playing with his shadow. [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 00:50, 30 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:OK, but they are walking to the sun in the morning. That's east (on northern hemisphere, I still do not think we are at Madagascar). So we do have an other fact:&lt;br /&gt;
:-Around time frame 1700 it's evening.&lt;br /&gt;
--[[User:Dgbrt|Dgbrt]] ([[User talk:Dgbrt|talk]]) 17:07, 30 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:-If you walk into the sun, you are walking east.&lt;br /&gt;
:-They then turned to their left to go upriver. That's would be going north.&lt;br /&gt;
:-If you are above the tropics, your shadow will always lay to the north of you.&lt;br /&gt;
:-Megan says what they're doing is better than when they had to walk into the sun, and it's been established that they walked along the sea for days, so they'd be familiar with walking with the sun directly behind them, too. If they were now walking west, it would pretty much be the same situation, except reversed. It doesn't really make sense to me that she'd call one situation better than the other. It feels more like they aren't walking into the sun ''at all'' anymore. Therefore, I think they are now keeping the sun relatively behind them by going north, which indicates they are north of the equator, and probably north of the Tropic of Cancer. Even at noon, the sun would be behind you slightly, to the south. And if you're walking uphill, it would be very visible to you.&lt;br /&gt;

::No, their shadows are in front of them, so they are either walking west in the morning or east in the evening.

== Snake Theories ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Megan mentions snakes with spikes over their eyes. That covers several species, all poisonous, but they are native to the American west and southwest, Mexico, Central America, north Africa and the Middle East. The snake that Cueball finds might be a {{w|Anguis fragilis|slow-worm}}, a limbless reptile native to Eurasia. It's shiny, brown, has a blunt head, and can shed its tail like a lizard, which might give it a half-finished look if Cueball saw it that way. But a stronger contender is the {{w|rubber boa}}, which is native to the western US, and has a famously stubby head and tail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This makes me think of one area: The {{w|Great Salt Lake}}. The {{w|Bear River (Utah)|Bear River}} empties into it from a northerly direction, and the area has the rubber boa and at least one type of poisonous horned snake. Native Americans of the area even had legends of the Horned Serpent. And that ''had'' to be a teepee we saw earlier. (I don't think Native Americans had trebuchets or berets, though....) --[[User:Druid816|Druid816]] ([[User talk:Druid816|talk]]) 01:59, 2 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

We've got chicks, and not the first time: In image 1830-1831 Megan says &amp;quot;I heard chirps from the night sky once. I was looking at the stars one night and I heard peeping. - It was very quiet. - just a single chirp now and then.&amp;quot; They were sleeping under a tree around image 1354, a bird flies overhead, later Cueball takes a walk. We can see some chicks at the end of his walk at images 1374-1376 [http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/?frame=1375&amp;amp;framediff=1374].

:I've been mapping the journey from the start, piecing each segment end-to-end in Photoshop. There is no significant net elevation change until they started following the river. The net elevation change from image #1150 to now (#1818) is 1402 pixels = 210.2 feet (assuming a 40 px average height of Cueball and using 40 px = 6 feet). However, since this is a comic, one may assume a greater height than that actually depicted. The horizontal distance along the same river walk is 59516 pixels = 8927.4 feet (1.7 mi, 2.7 km). I don't have the distances along the sea. The average speed, using 1 hr/frame update, is 0.0025 mph, 0.0041 kph (at 5 min/frame update the speed increases to 0.0304 mph).

== What do we know by the beginning of June? ==&lt;br /&gt;
:- thanks to [[User:Galois|Galois]] we do know they did travel around 3 km (NASA is getting better on this metric units).&lt;br /&gt;
:- thanks to [[User:Galois|Galois]] we do know they did climb approx. 65 meters (maybe slightly more because 6 feet or 1.8288 meters for Cueball is maybe a little bit too much).&lt;br /&gt;
:- they are still in real nature, the most technical devices we have seen is just wood.&lt;br /&gt;
:- but they also did cross a road at the beginning of their travel.&lt;br /&gt;

I'd like to think Cueball is shorter, I used 6 ft because it's convenient and yields longer distances. The tallest Baobob tree is 516 px (rescaled to the running comic) = 77.4 ft (23.6 m) using a 6 ft Cueball. Note that using a 5.5 ft (1.7 m) Cueball, the tree drops to 71 ft (21.6 m). The Wikipedia page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia_grandidieri] on the Grandidier's baobab states they can reach 25 to 30 m (80-100 ft) in height, 23.6 m is about right.

I don't follow this as religously as others so maybe I missed the obvious answer, but why is it assumed that we have seen all of the way they went?

(please sign your posts - don't worry, we're all here out of a mutual enjoyment of the xkcd comics) Actually, I looked into the possibility a while back, but it didn't work. Randall runs 3-5 frame updates with the two walking across the same panel. As they leave one panel on the right, they enter the next on the left (and visa-verse for the trip back to the sunken castle). Additionally, I only came across three panels that didn't adjoin perfectly (one in the sand dunes and two trees that didn't continue into the next panel).

== Philosophical implications ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think the huge following that this comic has gathered - the amount of work by people like Aubron Wood and the guys at geekwagon, explainxkcd editors, general xkcd enthusiasts, the people at XKCD time wiki - raises some interesting questions. At this point we're not even clear how Randall is writing these comics: he may have designed them all from the start, or he may be writing 24 a day, going along with it, according to the natural progression of events and what has led up to now. It has interesting parallels with the {{w|design argument}}. It also makes you wonder about how it's all going to end. There are so many ongoing discussions - and have been from the start - about how the comic is going to conclude. Just as in real life we take so many different roads and never really know where we're going to end up. If we're continuing with the religious theme we could extend the metaphor even further, about what happens after we die. We don't know if we're going to just stop existing or if we're going to end up in some elaborate afterlife. We don't know what Randall's going to do - how long will the comic go on? Could it last his entire lifetime? We have no way of knowing. --[[User:Mynotoar|Mynotoar]] ([[User talk:Mynotoar|talk]]) 14:05, 8 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I believe Randall is writing this as it goes along, preparing the scenes only a little bit in advance. The story (quest?) reads more like a series of isolated vignettes, but with a few themes being carried forward, such as the quest for the source of the rising sea. I'm here in homage to Randall's unique wit and humor, and having fun trying to second guess what he'll do next. I don't believe the setting is an actual place, but we have several clues that limit its location. I see this as a collection of disparate objects and events; some go together, some not, but with some running themes. Randall may be making some points (such as conservation, ecology, and not eating squirrels); although, I would have never filled a canteen from the small river without first boiling or purifying the water.

== Madagascar theory ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm still not sure that it is supposed to be a specific place, but going with the Madagascar theory, there is indeed a native Madagascar hedgehog -- the greater and lesser tenrecs. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Still no squirrels, though. [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 20:58, 14 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:That Madagascar trees are also imported to US. Hedgehogs are a famous pets in US, even when they do belong to Asia and Europe. We are still in the US, and more precisely around Utah. --[[User:Dgbrt|Dgbrt]] ([[User talk:Dgbrt|talk]]) 21:51, 14 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:Hedgehogs are found in many places. From the shadow comments, they are on a northern sea coast in the northern hemisphere, hence probably not Madagascar. There's something wrong with every possible location I checked. The Mediterranean Sea is rising because the water coming in from rivers is greater than that lost through evaporation [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea#Sea-level_rise] and is polluted [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea#Pollution], BUT a quick check has every possible northern coast covered with cities or agriculture. I lived in Salt Lake City for a little while. Antelope Island has oolitic sand on the north and west sides and is a mountain, but no major rivers or waterfalls[http://www.utah.com/stateparks/great_salt_lake_facts.htm]. The north coast is a boggy delta, except for a peninsula, which is covered with agriculture. Southern Utah is a better match and has waterfalls, but no sea. I gave up. [[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 18:04, 15 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:: The sea thing is certainly a problem for any modern-day Utah theory, but the tree that recently came on-screen (frame 2145) could be intended to be ''Pinus longaeva'', which would be appropriate to Utah (or many other parts of the Great Basin), high altitudes, and the comic theme.  Oh, also, if you want a rising, large body of water near Southern Utah there's always Lake Mead.  But it's probably not so large as to be mistaken for the sea. --Joe Decker&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:: I'm not sure that current agriculture would be an issue. Unless they are play-acting or in some kind of _The Village_ setup, they seem unlikely to be current-day humans. They seem strangely ignorant of some obvious things and yet aware of others. There might be a few tribal peoples living in tents that would be unaware of the next river over, but they would be unlikely to be confused by birds nesting. Or be using trebuchets and European castle architecture in sandcastles. And if they genuinely walked for &amp;quot;days&amp;quot; along the shore, it seems unlikely to be a _The Village_ setup; that's got to be 20 miles even taking a leisurely trip for just two days, and probably more.

It might be interesting, however, that there's a striking resemblance between the Grandidier's Baobab depicted in the comic at frame 1525 {{geekwagon|1525}} and the tree on the left in the Wikimedia picture [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Adansonia_grandidieri03.jpg Grandidier's Baobab (Adansonia grandidieri) near Morondava, Madagascar].

If this is Madagascar, then it would be a fossa ... but the head looks too big and cat-like. Perhaps a juvenile cougar/puma?  Would help explain why it bit the backpack instead of Cueball's neck.

Why is everyone assuming the location corresponds to an actual modern day location (e.g. Madagascar)?

As we now know that they are in the Mediterranean region, a {{w|Eurasian lynx}} or an {{w|Iberian lynx}} look quite good guesses but the cat in the comic has a tail that is too long and it doesn't have ear tufts. I guess if it is far enough in the future, the distribution of animals could have changed, so it might be {{w|Caracal}} (desert lynx), a {{w|Serval}} or an {{w|African golden cat}}.

I'll take a shot... The bottom part is curved and aligns perfectly with Cueball's head in Photoshop, just cutoff on the left (and the right as it goes out of frame). The rounded slice at the top matches Megan's head as well. The full slice does not match any scene to date (the only one close is 1885 with Megan in the tree, but that's not it); thus, it must be a slice from a future scene (or maybe part of a template with assorted characters).

:::Reviewing further, I'm even more convinced. If you get a star map in the right orientation, you can see that the rest of Scorpio is becoming visible just above the horizon in {{geekwagon|2393}}.  And the arc of stars the three consellations are 'facing' matches up with the Serpent and Ophiuchius, including the visual binary of Delta and Epsilon Ophiuchi.

== Star Map ==&lt;br /&gt;
Is someone already stitching together a map of the stars as they move through the frames? I could do it, but I'm too lazy *g*.&lt;br /&gt;
And if we have that, the relative position of the sun to the stars should be sufficient to determine the day of the year (depending on the accuracy of the drawings) and probably, assuming the first bright dot was indeed Venus, we might even be able to determine if the story takes/took place this year. Maybe other astronomical objects show (or don't show) and help to further narrow down the '''time'''. --[[Special:Contributions/92.76.250.121|92.76.250.121]] 00:18, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
:From the position of the sun, Venus is at or close to greatest eastern elongation from the sun.  Assuming that the constellations we are looking at are Sagittarius and surroundings (and the new stars coming into view continue to match this), the sun is located around Virgo.  From the angle of the ecliptic, they are at 30 degrees north, and thus it would have to be around the beginning of November, as that's when Virgo sets with the sun at 30N. So it could be a year when Venus hits the greatest eastern elongation in late October/early November.  Which happens this year, but it can't be this year as the moon isn't right -- there would be a crescent moon next to Venus. It would have to be at new moon or waning moon, and that puts it after 2037. Of course, there are a lot of assumptions and estimations in that calculation. [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 02:29, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
::Actually, for the moon it could be 2029, but there's another blocking factor: Mars should be next to Venus in 2037.  And for the next few eight year cycles, some combination of Mercury, the moon, and Saturn should be showing up between Venus and the Sun before the stars do. So it looks like 2053 would be the first matching date. And the next date after that 2085 - it precesses forward a bit each year, so it would be Nov 12 by 2085. Seems a bit late for grapes and hiking without any thought of shelter, but if it's 30N it is likely a pretty warm area.

I wandered over to the forum, and they agree with our conclusion of Sagittarius, and one of them had a interesting observation: Antares is gone. It should be the brightest thing in this view apart from Venus, and you can see the two stars that should flank it appear at {{geekwagon|2392}}, between Cueball's head and the tree, but no Antares. Which suggests that this is set sufficiently far in the future that Antares has gone supernova (which it is due to do.) [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 06:27, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
:Even more suggestive of a far future: certain of the stars in the Scorpion appear to have moved.  If you go to Hipparchos [[http://www.rssd.esa.int/SA-general/Projects/Hipparcos/apps/ShowMotion.html]] and enter RA 260.4, Dec -42, and V(lim) 4.4, you will get the stars in the head and part of the body of the Scorpion.

One last thing (for the moment): The angle of the sun and planets are what they should be for c. 30-33 degrees N, but to get the constellations angled the right way, it's closer to 12 degrees north. This may be precession, which could also explain the grapes in what would be currently by the stars the beginning of November -- the vernal equinox may have precessed forward, resulting in the sun being in Virgo/Libra in summer rather than fall. 15,000 years would put it in Libra in June, for example [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 16:27, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Where in the world are Megan and Cueball? ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Venus marking the path of the ecliptic tells us that we are at about 30 degrees north (my quick-ass calculation came up closer to 31 or 32 degrees north.) They are walking east with the ocean to the south of them, and they are following a large river north into hills and mountains that apparently are less than a day's walk north. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if it's Earth, where could they be? There's not a lot of south-facing coasts around 30N. The only large one is the Gulf Coast of the US, but there's not much in the way of hills much less anything you could call a mountain close to the shore. The only exception I can really see is maybe around Mobile, which at last has some hills. There's the north end of the Persian Gulf and of the Gulf of California, but for both of those the hills are east of of the most obvious large river.  Though the Gulf of California would make sense in other ways -- rivers that only run to the sea in the wet season, for example. There's South Korea, but the southern coast of that is broken up into a fringe of islands and peninsula, there's not really a solid stretch of coast to walk east along.  [[User:Tavella|Tavella]] ([[User talk:Tavella|talk]]) 00:14, 28 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:If, as hypothesized above, this is taking place a few thousand years into the future, might not the coastlines have changed?  (Especially since the &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; seems to be rising.)  I wonder if we could find the proper configuration of hills and a mountain even in absence of a body of water to the south.

All the stars are following the same parallel path through the sky. Shouldn't the stars should be following a circular path centered on the north star, and the planets if any be following roughly the path of the sun and moon? --deepfatfriar&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Someone mentioned the Clock of the Long Now, and the 10,000 Year Clock would fit in a number of ways.  The Texas original one is at the right latitude, and the Sierra Diablo mountains where it is are near a dried-up inland sea, which presumably could be a sea again, and an inland sea could rise much faster than the world's oceans.  And it would fit with the title &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot;, and explain the multi-thousand year future setting. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Has anyone been able to map exactly where the sun is on the stars? That would show where in the precession sequence we are. If it's in Libra, for example 15,000 years forward the sun would set in Libra around June at 31-32 degrees north at that point.  Which would explain the grapes and the camping without shelter.

I haven't done the exact calculations, but my impression from those we did that they have only climbed 300-400 cueball-heights, which would be only a couple of thousand feet.

It's the wrong end of the river for them to be building a dam, but I'm wondering, with all the surveying equipment, if they are diverting more water into the basin that Cueball and Megan live in.

Is this pair the Cueball and Meagan we've known from before? What impresses me is the level of ignorance this pair exhibits, compared to the couple we've come to know. This pair do not seem to understand oxygen starvation at higher altitudes, how tides work, etc. This almost flies in contradiction to the fact that, in the beginning, they were building sand castles. This presumes castles existed at some point in their own history if not currently. Castles indicate a certain level of knowledge and technology, which this current couple seem to lack knowledge of, to some large degree at least.&lt;br /&gt;
If this strip 'ends' at the level of technology we've seen thus far and hinted at by this new tribe of people, I would suggest this indicates a world wide (or at least very large area) collapse of a prior civilization.&lt;br /&gt;

But the last but ones in these frames just look close in my view (also to 9th in {{geekwagon|2671}})). Sentences seem to end with the an ° or ¯ above the last letter. [[User:Chtz|Chtz]] ([[User talk:Chtz|talk]]) 09:29, 9 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

I believe it's possible to translate their language into pervect english by simple replacing their symbols by roman letters (the right way). For &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; we have an example. ([[User talk:FG|talk]]) 17:12, 11 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
:What could the last word in {{geekwagon|2728}} be then? It ends the same way as &amp;quot;water&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;drink&amp;quot;, except for a ° instead of a ¯ over the last letter, but has an additional &amp;quot;3&amp;quot;-shaped letter at the beginning. I'm starting to believe that Randall put a bit more effort into designing this language. --[[User:Chtz|Chtz]] ([[User talk:Chtz|talk]]) 15:34, 11 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is clearly not a letter-per-letter cipher; I think Randall has been considerably cleverer than that. It looks like a (fictional) Semitic language, in which case individual characters could indicate syllables rather than letters, but I doubt that it is a simple cipher for English at the syllable level either. At this stage it is impossible to say how far he has gone in creating an original syntax, but I would note that we have seen the word that means &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;drink&amp;quot;) in at least two forms (a simple form used by Cueball, and a form with a kind of 3 at the beginning used as the last word of the Beanie's response to Cueball's picture). I'm confident the ¯ is simply a period, ° a question mark, and the double ¯ is an exclamation mark. The other stray marks could be other punctuation marks as well. [[User:KenBrown|KenBrown]] ([[User talk:KenBrown|talk]]) 15:55, 11 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
:Another reason why it's not a &amp;quot;letter-per-letter cipher&amp;quot; is that I'm pretty sure we've seen at least 3 distinct single character words. Note that almost all characters are reminiscent of arabic numerals. [[User:Markhurd|Mark Hurd]] ([[User talk:Markhurd|talk]]) 18:59, 11 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next speculation: [[File:Dialog2827.png]] could mean &amp;quot;(the) castle&amp;quot; and [[File:Dialog2806c.png]] could mean something like &amp;quot;(move) to the castle&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;(to be) at the castle&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;

I just noticed that translator often puts a ° or ¯ above last letter in some sentences, just like in stranglish (did we come up with a better name for it yet?).

== Passage of Time ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I suppose it is safe to assume that the black frame ({{geekwagon|2698}}) represents some indeterminate passage of time, since we do see Cueball now speaking the language of the Beanie-Wearers. What is strange, and perhaps it is just Randall being lazy, is that if you compare the frames before and after the black frame, there is absolutely no changes to vegetation, and very few changes to anything else. Vegetation would have been the biggest culprit to a lengthy time interval. (Again, assuming it took some non-trivial amount of time for Cueball to learn the new language.) --[[Special:Contributions/68.147.179.172|68.147.179.172]] 20:01, 10 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Megan's backpack ==&lt;br /&gt;
Megan started wearing a backpack after they left the tower. They lost Cueball's backpack when the animal clawed it up, so he carried everything in Megan's to keep weight off her leg. That ointment must be good stuff if she's able to walk with a backpack. The locals must have given her a new one.--[[User:Gerry|Gerry]] ([[User talk:Gerry|talk]]) 01:50, 16 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Who are they? ==&lt;br /&gt;
If the Great and Powerful OZ steps out from behind a curtain, I'll upchuck. Castles imply a need for defense, yet our adventurous pair and the 'natives' both seem totally relaxed with the discovery of the other. No obvious caution shown, no attempt to discover which side they may be on, etc. In fact, the 'natives' appear to be experienced with the finding of new people and following an established procedure for dealing with them, hence the trip to the castle. If Meagan and Cueball had declined to follow, what would have taken place then? Just a guess but I would say, nothing, each to their separate way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The one map view strongly suggests, to me, survey work using trigonometry (or some variation) to determine location. It would seem to be a case of figure the location first, get there, then see what you find. The greater and lesser circles are intriguing as well, along with the long, straight lines and other geometrical figures seen. Wish there was a bigger, clearer view of it.[[User:Riprap|Riprap]] ([[User talk:Riprap|talk]]) 00:11, 17 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

They could be adding to an extant structure - historically not an uncommon practice.  So the merlons could be historic.  As a side note, are there levers and pivots in the glass window? Maybe this is the temple of engineering??  ~~rbnm&lt;br /&gt;

It's interesting that the castle is mostly underground. I wonder if the &amp;quot;little houses&amp;quot; also extend underground? And I wonder if this is a sign this is a very hot climate for the Beanies / Long-haired woman (I like the idea of naming her Hypatia, as was suggested elsewhere.)  If it's hot for them up on the mountain where it is significantly cooler to Cuegan, maybe that explains why they didn't think there were people down in the sea basin.

Underground, an interesting theory but, many such structures had several levels below ground level, so as to reach the bedrock wherein to support the massive stone structure above.

By the way, Cueball and Megan have walked quite a long distance.  On Hair Woman's map their home appears to be due south of If, same longitude, and roughly at the latitude of Sassari, Sardinia.

Assuming this is the Mediterranean sea[http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/medsea.htm], the predicted sea level map in frame 2907 shows that the Balearic Islands will become completely submerged. Since the highest point on the Balearic Islands is 1432 meters above sea level [http://www.islasbaleares.com/en/general-information-about-balearic-islands.html], and Chateau D'If isn't nearly as high, wouldn't Chateau D'If become completely submerged as well?

== The story of Gibraltar ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Did the learner/teacher/leader/ruler know the truth? She did some guesses and used a map that their people had found. I can't imagine their parents did travel 2.000 kilometers to Gibraltar, Megan and Cueball must have walked to a level more than 1.000 meters above their home, and also several hundreds of kilometers. A Cougar does not belong to Europe; they were walking to a higher level, running out of breath. At sea level? I'm pretty sure this story is still not solved.--[[User:Dgbrt|Dgbrt]] ([[User talk:Dgbrt|talk]]) 21:49, 20 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

There is a nice artist's conception of the Zanclean Flood at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Roger_Pibernat_-_landscape_-_messianic_med-1024x768.jpg [[User:Taibhse|Taibhse]] ([[User talk:Taibhse|talk]]) 05:45, 21 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
It's not quite the same configuration as Randall's sea basin, but similar.  The flood has its own wiki page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanclean_flood. I really do not think there is any doubt that Randall's story takes place in a far-future (possibly with liberties taken) Mediterranean Basin, and Hair Woman's castle is the Chateau d'If under restoration.  The original Messinian Salinity Crisis (q.v.) is estimated to have taken a thousand years or so to stabilize once the Gibraltar (and possibly other) passage(s) closed, presumably as a result of tectonic activity under the influence of the two opposing continental plates colliding at the site of the present Mediterranean Sea.  [[User:Taibhse|Taibhse]] ([[User talk:Taibhse|talk]]) 05:45, 21 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I do believe it quite likely that Hair Woman's people's ancestors/forbears already were spread as far west as Gibraltar, which would explain why her people know about the Atlantic seeping in, and then flowing, through the barrier.  She said they attempted to reinforce the barrier, but failed, so certainly they were there at Gibraltar in the &amp;quot;present time&amp;quot; of the story.  And to draw (&amp;quot;build&amp;quot; she said) the outlines on the map, they had to have information about the second sea basin on the other side of Italy-Sardinia and the outlines of what we call the Adriatic, etc.  [[User:Taibhse|Taibhse]] ([[User talk:Taibhse|talk]]) 05:45, 21 July 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== PNG time chunks changed on the xkcd server ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The images mirrored http://xkcd.mscha.org/ and those served by xkcd servers differs in two PNG 'tEXt' chunks with keywords 'date:create' and 'date:modify', which appears to contain the original timestamps.  Images from mscha.org have wide range of these timestamps, indicating that the images weren't produced all at the same time. But the same frames downloaded from xkcd servers now have their time values set to &amp;quot;2013-05-01T15:11:05-04:00&amp;quot;, so either mscha or xkcd must have modified the PNGs. The compressed image data seems to be modified, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also note that the copy of the first frame found at mscha.org has been edited by Photoshop, because the PNG structure is different from all the others and contains a color profile beginning with &amp;quot;Photoshop ICC profile&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;

The picture does chance with time. The URL includes a changing timestamp that I can't decipher. Compare these two URLS (which have slightly different images:&lt;br /&gt;

Perhaps there is a way to hack the URL to view future images. [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:29, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I would also like to add that knowing randall, these are not the only images. For all we know, the image will still be changing in 5 years while a tree grows in front of them.

&lt;br /&gt;
Likely there is a way to hack the URLs; they look like some sort of hash, probably a hashed timestamp. Of course, he could easily have added some salt to the hash, making it significantly *harder* to hack. But they're strings of a specific length, so it should be pretty easy to bruteforce it, fetch all the images, and then (maybe) reverse-engineer the sequence. *That* all depends on how many of them there are.

: Given that the images switch back and forth between other images already seen, and that the comic should be viewable in the future, it seems unlikely that it's any thing like a simple sha256 of part of the timestamp.  I think it's more likely a function of half-hours and minutes (assuming we continue to get a new possible image every half-hour).

::: The images do cycle, yes. But for some reason I have never seen the img where Megan is looking behind her. Also wouldn't it be difficult to show a sequential story (like the rising tide) if the previous images keep cycling ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hash appears to be SHA-256. I tried some obvious hashes (&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;11901&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190_1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190.1&amp;quot;) to no avail.

It's entirely possible that the &amp;quot;hash&amp;quot; is actually randomly generated. Just a thought. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.119.153|129.21.119.153]] 07:03, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Regarding sha256. Its most likely some hash of a timestamp, but if he doesnt wants us to crack it, he would have prefixes a password.. sha256('secretcode17:30'). Im just saying, if he doesnt wants us to crack it, we most likely cant.&lt;br /&gt;
I've tested all unixtimestamps from 1300000000 to 1364390334. Also &amp;quot;00:00&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;23:59&amp;quot;, with and without the colon and a load of other formats. {{unsigned|77.243.128.133}}&lt;br /&gt;

Alright, this is probably not going to work, but I'm trying to exploit Randall's awesomeness here. Maybe he decided to take the time-stamps from the user? I don't know if that's even possible... That would then allow people in different time zones to obtain different images simultaneously. (What's the corollary of Godwin's law for a bunch of math-and-science nerds and relativity? Is there one?) Clicking the img src url on the comic's html page, give me this: http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/752687b61523144c61736cd89f8c153dc41e19128f72d78d44947ff800f057fa.png : Never mind.. apparently others see the same image too.&lt;br /&gt;

::::: The script seems to poll the server every minute or two. It's different from before, where the image server itself redirected to the correct image. The auto refresh was probably always intended, but not quite ready when the comic went live. It may have turned out to be necessary too, so the image server doesn't have to do all the work.

Is it just me or or did Randall manage to make all of us perform a Denial of Service on xkcd.com, and explainxkcd.com ? xkcd.com seems much slower, and I keep getting &amp;quot;500 Internal server error&amp;quot; when accessing this site (explainxkcd.com). I guess that's the effect of having everybody hit F5 every few minutes :) [[Special:Contributions/193.239.192.194|193.239.192.194]] 11:57, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Earlier today, the server handled all the image redirections. The script you see above went through several mutations (currently at #8), with each mutation it seems that Randall is adding more servers and trying to split the load between them. This is basically how a bot-net works - we all run code written by some evil genius, and he's changing the code as time passes to serve some hidden purpose.&lt;br /&gt;

When I saw this comic last night and that there was no explanation up, I thought to myself &amp;quot;How zen.&amp;quot;  I figured that Randall was going through a calm streak before throwing us the utterly ridiculous April 1st comic.

For those wondering about the Javascript behind this: I posted my analysis of the Javascript [http://www.echochamber.me/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=101043&amp;amp;start=760#p3303579 on the xkcd forums], and further de-obfuscated and annotated the code over on [https://gist.github.com/cincodenada/5246094 GitHub].  Here's a quick summary though: it holds open a connection to xkcd's servers and listens for instructions and follows them. Those instructions are either &amp;quot;load a new image&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;reload the page&amp;quot;. So, you don't have to mash F5, it will automatically update the image when they're available. We have no way to control how fast the images come or when they do, and it's quite possible for them to update forever. --[[User:Fiveofoh|Fiveofoh]] ([[User talk:Fiveofoh|talk]]) 06:41, 27 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

This is a series of animation frames. I suspect they will only ever be shown once (based on the fact you can only get the current image, not previous or future images -- this is in keeping with the title, &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot;, which passes and which you can't ever get back].

Call me a paranoid, but I think this strip is all about 9/11:&lt;br /&gt;
*If you read the strip number (1190) backwards, you get 09/11&lt;br /&gt;
*This subject is recurrent on xkcd&lt;br /&gt;
*As far as we have seen, there is a destroyed tower and they are rebuilding it&lt;br /&gt;
*The next strip, following 1190 (or 09/11), mentions war against countries with large oil reserves but low military capacity. {{unsigned|143.107.105.14}}&lt;br /&gt;
:I feel like that's kind of a stretch, I'm pretty sure it's just a story about a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If a new strip goes up every 30 minutes our time, and if each strip comprises of, let's say for the sake of simplicity, one minute in their time; to build the sand castle [frames 24-117 = 93 frames] so far it's taken almost 2 days our time, which would be about an hour and a half their time if each frame is a minute.  Using my scale, an hour our time is 2 minutes their time, a day is 48 minutes, and our month is their 24 hour day.  If we assume Randall plans to give us a 24 hour period from that world's time, and we use the minute-per-frame rate I made up, than we'd probably be looking at a month of images our time.  I guess we'll just have to see how long he's got it planned to go on. -boB&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Has it ended? All that's left is the sandcastle, and there doesn't seem to have been anything else changed on it for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's zooming out! When look at the gifs showing the frames in succession, the last 3 show the castle getting slightly smaller each time!&lt;br /&gt;
: It's true! The most recent also shows the edge of another castle, leading me to believe it's part of some kind of sand castle contest, probably including some of xkcd's other recurring characters!&lt;br /&gt;

Strange: As far as I know http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time.png always redirects to the current frame. But if you visit the current one (133:00) at http://xkcd.com/1190/ and check the displayed image, it says 'c6976fbb244af4fc2286ffe3ac2cf78d408c1f610ecd71e18b4a677a048f084d.png' while time.png redirects to '1d9ce7199935b1b629d6b8744e62c7700a3780357b2dc74bb70471db616ddadb.png'.

I'm seeing some strange stuff now. I have a script that uses wget of time.png to get the redirected hash png like Lockyy is doing. And I can verify that when you go to the 1190 page in the browser you get a different hash. But the previous hour and this hour, unlike the ones before it, the two hash pngs are different. And when I refresh the screen in my browser at the 1190 page, first I see the image I get from time.png, then the image refreshes with the other one. I'm not sure what this means or what we are supposed to do with it. I added the time.png hashes to the table for the last two hours but we probably need a way of indicating the difference. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 20:38, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: This latest hourly update did the same thing. If you are fast enough you can even get the first image in your browser by right click view image before it changes to the second one.

: Looking at it some more, I see that wget of the page at xkcd.com/1190/ gets you an img link to time.png and then there is the javascript that must after some delay get the different hash url image. That means that we had better be sure that we do not miss any manual checks of hourly updates because the scripts will never find that second image unless someone has a way of getting a script that runs the javascript as if it was a browser. As long as someone posts the hash of the image from the browser every hour, I can ensure that we have the hashes the scripts can get because I have a cron job checking for those updates every 15 minutes. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 21:49, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

When Megan coughed and Cueball asked if she was okay, did anyone else think of http://xkcd.com/931/ Lanes? Cueball explains that cancer treatment results are not known until much later, &amp;quot;and often the first sign is a cough or a bone pain.  So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry . . . .&amp;quot; ~~wrybred&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:I don't want to be a downer but this is just my interpretation thus far. I hope it is a happier theme but if you are correct wrybred, my further explanation would be the following... I think that building sandcastles is an analogy for living their life. Going for a swim in the body of water and the cough could represent the start of the cancer or possibly some time where they had to go out and &amp;quot;wade&amp;quot; in the possibilities of what cancer could mean. Time passes and Cueball says &amp;quot;I don't think we can build it much taller than this. It's been fun, though&amp;quot; which represents that they believe they have done as well as they can with the lives they have been given. They comment on the river retreating even though we the audience observe a body of water on the right hand side rising could represent how we can be fooled into believing things are going alright when in reality they are not. The reference to not understanding what the river is doing also fits this explanation well as someone with cancer may occasionally feel confused about their illness. Presently while I write this they are possibly preparing for a flood which represents the return of the cancer. If I were to guess what is next I might guess that they will watch as the flood comes in and destroys some of what they built but it is better than not having made the sandcastle in the first place. I could be way off, but Randall has given us a lot of TIME to think about what this is all about and your mind wanders. I also would note that this may not be about a particular cancer story, just any cancer story. [[User:Nhoel|Nhoel]] ([[User talk:Nhoel|talk]]) 13:51, 8 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

I think by tasting the water Cueball was preparing himself for the inevitable - the water is going to continue to rise and nothing they can do will stop it: they are going to drown.

In the frame-by-frame breakdown, the &amp;quot;Image&amp;quot; field simply gives the time in hours, while the &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; field gives the time in days+hours.  It would be helpful if the &amp;quot;Image&amp;quot; field instead gave an ordinal number indicating the number of frames (e.g., this would help to correlate the Transcript on this page with the frame numbers [http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/ here].  The current &amp;quot;Image&amp;quot; field need not be deleted (I personally prefer time in hours to time in days+hours), but it might be relabeled as &amp;quot;Time in Hours&amp;quot;.  Implementing this would require some use of scripts, and would be best if adopted by the person updating the frame-by-frame breakdown in the first place.

When the server had a problem one image was 100 minutes late, and another was 50 minutes late. Because of this there was a file between time682 and time683 that wasn't posted here (time683 should have been time684), and many files after that are displayed here an hour before they should have been displayed, with the wrong filename.

I'm guessing that the water will keep rising indefinitely, and we'll be left with an upward-moving strip that occasionally zooms out as the bottom layers are very slowly filled in with black &amp;quot;water.&amp;quot; One thing that would make this interesting is the varying heights of the constructed structures (sandcastle turrets, platform, etc.) which would make the process of &amp;quot;overflow&amp;quot; from the right-hand side interesting to watch. {{unsigned ip|65.96.75.37}}&lt;br /&gt;

Oh the symbolism of it: Cueball leaves, Megan finishes building their castle, rests and lets her guard down. The next thing to happen is, a cute girl walks in, sees what the two have built together and leaves. The very next frame, the castle starts to fall apart. [[Special:Contributions/217.81.90.198|217.81.90.198]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm expecting the lower level-castle to be swept away by the water, while the high-level castle will remain intact. This is quite reasonable, assuming Cueball and Megan knows how high the flood will come and thus they built the platform to an appropriate height. It may be interpreted as the lower-level castle being the work of our life, which is inevitable finite, and will be eventually overtaken by death. Recognizing this, some choose to build a castle for the &amp;quot;after-life&amp;quot;. Life-death reflections have been common on xkcd in the past as well. {{unsigned ip|149.241.18.229}}&lt;br /&gt;

For me, this is clearly about cancer and the impacts it has on a relationship over time. Randall's now wife was diagnosed and treated for cancer recently and through this comic, he's trying to portray the anxious wait they faced through treatment and remission.  He has put us into his shoes by keeping us waiting in suspense to see how things end up.  The passing of time represents their life together.  At first it's just them relaxing together, probably the dating phase.  Soon they start building a life together, represented by the sand castle.  The castle evolves over time, much like their life has.  Difficulties and gaffes in their relationship are depicted, for example when cueball trips and breaks down part of the wall.  Eventually all efforts are diverted and put into defending against the approaching sea, which represents the cancer.  The wall, the platform, all represent the steps taken to prevent and/or prepare for it's impending progress.  The river represents the cure for cancer, which is still pretty far out, as cueball mentioned.  There are many many more clues I see and explanations I can give to support this idea (castle in the sky, the rain, progress with research, etc.), but this is just starting point.  I'm excited to see where the comic will end up, but I guess we just need to &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;.  --[[User:Nick|Nick]] ([[User talk:Nick|talk]]) 21:25, 24 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

I'm taking it that &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; is a phonetic substitute for &amp;quot;c,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;meaning &amp;quot;cancer.&amp;quot;  For better or worse, this kind of phoenetic clue was used in the Batman movie:&lt;br /&gt;

Well, I don't know if the intention here is that the &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; is making the &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; grow.  My point is that the dialogue is so nonsensical at points that it seems to be code.  I'm taking every noun as a metaphor for something.  &amp;quot;Sea&amp;quot; being &amp;quot;cancer&amp;quot; seems to fit (&amp;quot;The cancer can't make more of itself forever, can it?&amp;quot;)  I guess go back through the dialogue and see what other words could substitute for what they're saying.

I agree - the water has started eroding the castle to the right, and it makes sense for the erosion to potentially loop the comic back to frame 1. That said, the title text was &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;. This could be a euphamism suggesting &amp;quot;keep waiting, this comic changes&amp;quot;, but it does have an implication that there is a &amp;quot;finale&amp;quot; to the comic that you should wait for.

The most recent event is Megan walking in, saying &amp;quot;bye!&amp;quot; in *lower case*, and leaving.  From the lower case, which is different from the rest of the comic, I infer that she was talking to *us*, not (eg) herself or the sandcastle!  I reckon it's just going to fill up with water until the page is a static black rectangle.

Just wanted to say: I don't think the beret girl is a girl at all. It's a boy with an old-fashioned navy-style cap. Popular with boys at the beach (in the old days). See images here (http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x130/JTMarcus/h1.jpg) and here (http://cabinetcardgallery.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/kidwithcap_0003.jpg) I also like the fact that, just before the castle completely fades away, you can barely see the little boy bringing more materials (maybe another support beam?) to continue the work.&lt;br /&gt;
I like the continuity of letting the beret boy (not girl)&lt;br /&gt;
: Wether it's a navy cap or not may be open to interpretation (though I'd still bet it's a beret - it surely looks a lot more like the one the beret guy wears, and I think Randall would have put a little more effort into that detail if he wanted it to pass off as a navy cap). As for it being a boy, no. It's definitely a girl, you can clearly see it has a longer hair, and come to think of it, Randall rarely draws any hair at all for male characters anyway. --[[Special:Contributions/201.53.213.201|201.53.213.201]] 23:36, 29 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

I am hoping that this &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; somehow connects to the [http://xkcd.com/1110/ &amp;quot;Click and Drag&amp;quot;] comic i.e. when the camera zoom out far enough, we'll see that they are actually in the &amp;quot;Click and Drag&amp;quot; world. --[[Special:Contributions/98.14.191.109|98.14.191.109]] 23:59, 29 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Odd, it looks like +861, +862, and +863 are out of order, judging by the ground not changing at all and the characters not walking continuously.

During the last glacial period the sea level was more than 100 meters lower than it is nowadays, so coastal structures looked very different and the continents exposed much more land. I believe the first act of this comic references medieval ages in Europe where people would witness (over the scope of hundreds of years or longer) losing land and coastal towns to the sea but not understanding the process, as Megan states. I'm expecting the second act, and possibly further acts, to reference the abundance of scientifical discoveries made during the last few centuries.

Well, they've made it back to the beach.  I think it will end either at 1000 or 1024, and the only reason it might go to 1024 is allow some dialog and zooming in. :-)  --[[User:Divad27182|Divad27182]] ([[User talk:Divad27182|talk]]) 18:01, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I thought that too initially - the terrain features certainly seems identical (to scale) to the one at the start of the story. But something's bothering me; it's about the frame before we see they are back on a beach - they are already seated, so it's fair to assume they haven't moved, yet the terrain is different. By looking at the terrain, you could guess that maybe the terrain is inverted, which would then indicate that the frame with the beach in view is from a different angle than the previous frame. But for that to be the case, Cueball would have to be behind Megan on the previous frame, yet, their positions are unchanged on these frames. So, I don't know...

Wait, what? It looks like they are suddenly back at a beach that looks the same as the first one, just zoomed out. But before when the scene was presumably inverted, the terrain didn't look quite like that. If the scene really did get inverted, maybe they aren't actually on a beach right now, but the sea will eventually expand until it reaches them. Then again, we don't know if this is the same plane of space that the original beach was either. They were just walking to the right. The concept of space in this comic is confusing me right now. I wonder if this will make sense later. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.63.158|129.21.63.158]] 18:41, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

It appears that the camera perspective has changed. 1 - 970 are all perpendicular to the shoreline, with the water on the right, camera looking down the shore. 971-996 are shown parallel to the shore line, with the camera position apparently out over the water or standing at the shore, looking back toward land. (If the camera had maintained the original position, the characters would have simply gotten smaller as the walked away, but instead we got to see the walk across the frame while presumably following the shore.) In 997, the camera perspective just comes back around to be a profile shot again, looking down the shoreline, water once again on the right. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.183.156.9|65.183.156.9]] 19:40, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
969:00 41/09:00 f8a6414c334a71481e16428691fe8465098b2bae956e44727d0482c7632a84ff.png &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I'm getting ...a84ff from http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time.png, but the main http://xkcd.com/1190/ gives the current image. [[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 23:43, 4 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
The 00:00 UTC (8 pm EDT) update worked. [[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 00:02, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Has anyone noticed that the exact same identical image was re-used several times recently? If you go to http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/ and tell it to show differences from frame 1090, and then start clicking forward, the following frames are all exactly the same: 1094, 1097, 1101, 1103, 1107. Looking at http://xkcd.aubronwood.com/# you can then see that 1111 and 1113 are also the same. The rapid perspective change makes the animation appear to strobe. Could this be some strange attempt to illustrate something like an earthquake, or are they just re-using frames to avoid having to draw so many? [[Special:Contributions/65.183.156.9|65.183.156.9]] 02:38, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Hours ==&lt;br /&gt;
There seems to be a problem starting with today (Sunday, 2013-05-05): The first picture should be 984:00 and not 983:00. I'm not able to check if it's simply a bot (?) error writing down the hours or something more serious. --[[Special:Contributions/82.135.84.245|82.135.84.245]] 15:56, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Hour 983 on image 1104 Saturday (23:00 UTC) also appears on image 1105 Sunday (00:00 UTC). The image numbers are correct, but the hour count appears to be off by 1 hour now.[[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 16:34, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Not all images do map to the hash ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I did run this great command posted here before on 13 April 2013:&lt;br /&gt;
 md5sum -b * | sort | uniq -w32 -D&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then I did rename all duplicates to image???_.png. After that I did download the hashes from here to image???.png and run the check again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First result is easy. Files are changed so md5sum for image002_ and image002 are different but content is the same. But 004 is wrong and I will update this one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 878341ab1f710e5832aa7ed5cfa66ed7 *image002_.png&lt;br /&gt;
 878341ab1f710e5832aa7ed5cfa66ed7 *image004_.png&lt;br /&gt;

== Split the movie ? ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The page is becoming impossible to load.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would suggest to split the movie into pieces, for instance by making a separate sub-page for each week (avoiding embarassing discussion on the most natural cutting point). Each week can have a separate description, seven-seconds animation, list of 7x24 pictures etc, and a link to the following and previous weeks.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
:My only suggestion would be give it larger segments. I don't think it needs to be as small as a week - after all, it loaded fine for a very long time. Maybe approx. half a scene each? Scene 1 is 971 frames long, so how about split at 500, at 971, and again at 1500 (when it gets there)? [[Special:Contributions/24.129.75.17|24.129.75.17]] 08:12, 8 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
::It's one and a half megabytes. The biggest issue here probably is the anemic servers that managed to struggle and crash even when that animation was just a static png and the page itself was only a few lines long.

This could be a cinematic custom to change scenes or to show the passage of time: fade to black (white) on Act I, come up on Act II. Get some popcorn during the intermission.{{unsigned|Gerry|11:38, 29 April 2013 (UTC)}}&lt;br /&gt;

The picture does chance with time. The URL includes a changing timestamp that I can't decipher. Compare these two URLS (which have slightly different images:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps there is a way to hack the URL to view future images. [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:29, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I would also like to add that knowing randall, these are not the only images. For all we know, the image will still be changing in 5 years while a tree grows in front of them. My point is: Are the URLs hackable, or did he encrypt them? [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:33, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Likely there is a way to hack the URLs; they look like some sort of hash, probably a hashed timestamp. Of course, he could easily have added some salt to the hash, making it significantly *harder* to hack. But they're strings of a specific length, so it should be pretty easy to bruteforce it, fetch all the images, and then (maybe) reverse-engineer the sequence. *That* all depends on how many of them there are.

It seems that the image is updated every 1/2 hour. [[Special:Contributions/152.23.97.150|152.23.97.150]] 06:17, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: Given that the images switch back and forth between other images already seen, and that the comic should be viewable in the future, it seems unlikely that it's any thing like a simple sha256 of part of the timestamp.  I think it's more likely a function of half-hours and minutes (assuming we continue to get a new possible image every half-hour). [[Special:Contributions/99.153.248.206|99.153.248.206]] 06:59, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
::: The images do cycle, yes. But for some reason I have never seen the img where Megan is looking behind her. Also wouldn't it be difficult to show a sequential story (like the rising tide) if the previous images keep cycling ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hash appears to be SHA-256. I tried some obvious hashes (&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;11901&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190_1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190.1&amp;quot;) to no avail. Maybe this is HMAC-SHA256? Also, I would suggest trying Unix timestamps. [[Special:Contributions/131.156.236.149|131.156.236.149]] 06:19, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I've been trying to make educated guesses as to what's being hashed here: http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator ... he could also be using hash(hash2(value)) which would be virtually impossible to crack.

&lt;br /&gt;
It's entirely possible that the &amp;quot;hash&amp;quot; is actually randomly generated. Just a thought. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.119.153|129.21.119.153]] 07:03, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regarding sha256. Its most likely some hash of a timestamp, but if he doesnt wants us to crack it, he would have prefixes a password.. sha256('secretcode17:30'). Im just saying, if he doesnt wants us to crack it, we most likely cant.&lt;br /&gt;
I've tested all unixtimestamps from 1300000000 to 1364390334. Also &amp;quot;00:00&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;23:59&amp;quot;, with and without the colon and a load of other formats. {{unsigned|77.243.128.133}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alright, this is probably not going to work, but I'm trying to exploit Randall's awesomeness here. Maybe he decided to take the time-stamps from the user? I don't know if that's even possible... That would then allow people in different time zones to obtain different images simultaneously. (What's the corollary of Godwin's law for a bunch of math-and-science nerds and relativity? Is there one?) Clicking the img src url on the comic's html page, give me this: http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/752687b61523144c61736cd89f8c153dc41e19128f72d78d44947ff800f057fa.png : Never mind.. apparently others see the same image too.&lt;br /&gt;

Is it just me or or did Randall manage to make all of us perform a Denial of Service on xkcd.com, and explainxkcd.com ? xkcd.com seems much slower, and I keep getting &amp;quot;500 Internal server error&amp;quot; when accessing this site (explainxkcd.com).

Earlier today, the server handled all the image redirections. The script you see above went through several mutations (currently at #8), with each mutation it seems that Randall is adding more servers and trying to split the load between them. This is basically how a bot-net works - we all run code written by some evil genius, and he's changing the code as time passes to serve some hidden purpose.&lt;br /&gt;

:I liked this idea and crunched the hex data for 00:00 to 51:00 into a binary file (http://filebin.ca/bcGyfUvdgBi). Can't see anything resembling a file header, but that doesn't really say much. If this is compressed header-less data there wouldn't likely be any easily discernible patterns.

For those wondering about the Javascript behind this: I posted my analysis of the Javascript [http://www.echochamber.me/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=101043&amp;amp;start=760#p3303579 on the xkcd forums], and further de-obfuscated and annotated the code over on [https://gist.github.com/cincodenada/5246094 GitHub].  Here's a quick summary though: it holds open a connection to xkcd's servers and listens for instructions and follows them. Those instructions are either &amp;quot;load a new image&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;reload the page&amp;quot;. So, you don't have to mash F5, it will automatically update the image when they're available. We have no way to control how fast the images come or when they do, and it's quite possible for them to update forever. --[[User:Fiveofoh|Fiveofoh]] ([[User talk:Fiveofoh|talk]]) 06:41, 27 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

This is a series of animation frames. I suspect they will only ever be shown once (based on the fact you can only get the current image, not previous or future images -- this is in keeping with the title, &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot;, which passes and which you can't ever get back]. The filenames are UUIDs too long to guess, so somebody needs to start collecting the filenames here so that a proper flipbook can be assembled.

Call me a paranoid, but I think this strip is all about 9/11:&lt;br /&gt;
*If you read the strip number (1190) backwards, you get 09/11&lt;br /&gt;
*This subject is recurrent on xkcd&lt;br /&gt;
*As far as we have seen, there is a destroyed tower and they are rebuilding it&lt;br /&gt;
*The next strip, following 1190 (or 09/11), mentions war against countries with large oil reserves but low military capacity. {{unsigned|143.107.105.14}}&lt;br /&gt;
:I feel like that's kind of a stretch, I'm pretty sure it's just a story about a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If a new strip goes up every 30 minutes our time, and if each strip comprises of, let's say for the sake of simplicity, one minute in their time; to build the sand castle [frames 24-117 = 93 frames] so far it's taken almost 2 days our time, which would be about an hour and a half their time if each frame is a minute.  Using my scale, an hour our time is 2 minutes their time, a day is 48 minutes, and our month is their 24 hour day.  If we assume Randall plans to give us a 24 hour period from that world's time, and we use the minute-per-frame rate I made up, than we'd probably be looking at a month of images our time.  I guess we'll just have to see how long he's got it planned to go on. -boB&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Has it ended? All that's left is the sandcastle, and there doesn't seem to have been anything else changed on it for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;

It's zooming out! When look at the gifs showing the frames in succession, the last 3 show the castle getting slightly smaller each time!&lt;br /&gt;
: It's true! The most recent also shows the edge of another castle, leading me to believe it's part of some kind of sand castle contest, probably including some of xkcd's other recurring characters!&lt;br /&gt;

Strange: As far as I know http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time.png always redirects to the current frame. But if you visit the current one (133:00) at http://xkcd.com/1190/ and check the displayed image, it says 'c6976fbb244af4fc2286ffe3ac2cf78d408c1f610ecd71e18b4a677a048f084d.png' while time.png redirects to '1d9ce7199935b1b629d6b8744e62c7700a3780357b2dc74bb70471db616ddadb.png'. If you take a md5 of both images, they appear to be the same.&lt;br /&gt;
:I was confused by this as well, I'm grabbing the images myself via time.png and got the 1d9ce7 hash. How will these duplicates be displayed in the table?[[User:Lockyy|Lockyy]] ([[User talk:Lockyy|talk]]) 17:48, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm seeing some strange stuff now. I have a script that uses wget of time.png to get the redirected hash png like Lockyy is doing. And I can verify that when you go to the 1190 page in the browser you get a different hash. But the previous hour and this hour, unlike the ones before it, the two hash pngs are different. And when I refresh the screen in my browser at the 1190 page, first I see the image I get from time.png, then the image refreshes with the other one. I'm not sure what this means or what we are supposed to do with it. I added the time.png hashes to the table for the last two hours but we probably need a way of indicating the difference. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 20:38, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: This latest hourly update did the same thing. If you are fast enough you can even get the first image in your browser by right click view image before it changes to the second one. I edited in something that shows that.

: Looking at it some more, I see that wget of the page at xkcd.com/1190/ gets you an img link to time.png and then there is the javascript that must after some delay get the different hash url image. That means that we had better be sure that we do not miss any manual checks of hourly updates because the scripts will never find that second image unless someone has a way of getting a script that runs the javascript as if it was a browser. As long as someone posts the hash of the image from the browser every hour, I can ensure that we have the hashes the scripts can get because I have a cron job checking for those updates every 15 minutes. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 21:49, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

When Megan coughed and Cueball asked if she was okay, did anyone else think of http://xkcd.com/931/ Lanes? Cueball explains that cancer treatment results are not known until much later, &amp;quot;and often the first sign is a cough or a bone pain.  So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry . . . .&amp;quot; ~~wrybred&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:I don't want to be a downer but this is just my interpretation thus far. I hope it is a happier theme but if you are correct wrybred, my further explanation would be the following... I think that building sandcastles is an analogy for living their life. Going for a swim in the body of water and the cough could represent the start of the cancer or possibly some time where they had to go out and &amp;quot;wade&amp;quot; in the possibilities of what cancer could mean. Time passes and Cueball says &amp;quot;I don't think we can build it much taller than this. It's been fun, though&amp;quot; which represents that they believe they have done as well as they can with the lives they have been given. They comment on the river retreating even though we the audience observe a body of water on the right hand side rising could represent how we can be fooled into believing things are going alright when in reality they are not. The reference to not understanding what the river is doing also fits this explanation well as someone with cancer may occasionally feel confused about their illness. Presently while I write this they are possibly preparing for a flood which represents the return of the cancer. If I were to guess what is next I might guess that they will watch as the flood comes in and destroys some of what they built but it is better than not having made the sandcastle in the first place. I could be way off, but Randall has given us a lot of TIME to think about what this is all about and your mind wanders. I also would note that this may not be about a particular cancer story, just any cancer story. [[User:Nhoel|Nhoel]] ([[User talk:Nhoel|talk]]) 13:51, 8 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

::A small hill can stop the sea if it extends infinitely in the Z axis, otherwise the sea will simply flow around it. The other alternative is to encircle the castle with it, forming a moat, but then we wouldn't be able to see the inside. So this can't be a normal 3D universe. Lending some weight to the 2D or nearly 2D nature is that the first platform they put up was installed on only two posts. But the platform itself had width.

If this were a 2D universe, wouldn't the best course of action be to bury one of the poles directly at the water's edge?

I'm guessing that the water will keep rising indefinitely, and we'll be left with an upward-moving strip that occasionally zooms out as the bottom layers are very slowly filled in with black &amp;quot;water.&amp;quot; One thing that would make this interesting is the varying heights of the constructed structures (sandcastle turrets, platform, etc.) which would make the process of &amp;quot;overflow&amp;quot; from the right-hand side interesting to watch. {{unsigned ip|65.96.75.37}}&lt;br /&gt;

Oh the symbolism of it: Cueball leaves, Megan finishes building their castle, rests and lets her guard down.

I'm expecting the lower level-castle to be swept away by the water, while the high-level castle will remain intact. This is quite reasonable, assuming Cueball and Megan knows how high the flood will come and thus they built the platform to an appropriate height. It may be interpreted as the lower-level castle being the work of our life, which is inevitable finite, and will be eventually overtaken by death. Recognizing this, some choose to build a castle for the &amp;quot;after-life&amp;quot;. Life-death reflections have been common on xkcd in the past as well. {{unsigned ip|149.241.18.229}}&lt;br /&gt;

For me, this is clearly about cancer and the impacts it has on a relationship over time. Randall's now wife was diagnosed and treated for cancer recently and through this comic, he's trying to portray the anxious wait they faced through treatment and remission.  He has put us into his shoes by keeping us waiting in suspense to see how things end up.  The passing of time represents their life together.  At first it's just them relaxing together, probably the dating phase.  Soon they start building a life together, represented by the sand castle.  The castle evolves over time, much like their life has.  Difficulties and gaffes in their relationship are depicted, for example when cueball trips and breaks down part of the wall.  Eventually all efforts are diverted and put into defending against the approaching sea, which represents the cancer.  The wall, the platform, all represent the steps taken to prevent and/or prepare for it's impending progress.  The river represents the cure for cancer, which is still pretty far out, as cueball mentioned.  There are many many more clues I see and explanations I can give to support this idea (castle in the sky, the rain, progress with research, etc.), but this is just starting point.  I'm excited to see where the comic will end up, but I guess we just need to &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;.  --[[User:Nick|Nick]] ([[User talk:Nick|talk]]) 21:25, 24 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

The cancer metaphors are quite intriguing, but my take is environmental, possibly pollution and global warming. The French girl (beret) could be a nod to the Disneyland Paris castle.

I'm taking it that &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; is a phonetic substitute for &amp;quot;c,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;meaning &amp;quot;cancer.&amp;quot;  For better or worse, this kind of phoenetic clue was used in the Batman movie:&lt;br /&gt;

Well, I don't know if the intention here is that the &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; is making the &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; grow.  My point is that the dialogue is so nonsensical at points that it seems to be code.  I'm taking every noun as a metaphor for something.  &amp;quot;Sea&amp;quot; being &amp;quot;cancer&amp;quot; seems to fit (&amp;quot;The cancer can't make more of itself forever, can it?&amp;quot;)  I guess go back through the dialogue and see what other words could substitute for what they're saying.  Like I said, I don't know what &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;rain&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ground&amp;quot; could be in this metaphor.

I think this is the last day.  It's been exactly a month, they seem pretty done with it, and tomorrow's friday....On top of that, the most recent comic was the flipping of a switch on a time machine, in which, something happened, but we don't yet know what....it may be that the &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; comic is being refreshed.  ...Just a thought....

I expect that from now on (Friday April 26th 2013) there will be no more story and the sea will erode the castle until nothing is left (most likely software generated).

I agree - the water has started eroding the castle to the right, and it makes sense for the erosion to potentially loop the comic back to frame 1. That said, the title text was &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;. This could be a euphamism suggesting &amp;quot;keep waiting, this comic changes&amp;quot;, but it does have an implication that there is a &amp;quot;finale&amp;quot; to the comic that you should wait for.

The most recent event is Megan walking in, saying &amp;quot;bye!&amp;quot; in *lower case*, and leaving.  From the lower case, which is different from the rest of the comic, I infer that she was talking to *us*, not (eg) herself or the sandcastle!  I reckon it's just going to fill up with water until the page is a static black rectangle. Especially since she and Cueball just talked about going off and exploring, grabbed their bags, and left. -cosmogoblin [[Special:Contributions/94.197.127.235|94.197.127.235]] 13:57, 26 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

: I suspect the small text was to show a &amp;quot;small voice&amp;quot; - talking quietly and sadly perhaps?

:: I agree with the small voice. The sea level is still rising, and interestingly, the sand barrier on the far right is eroding on *both sides* -- not just the seaward side, as previously.

::: The &amp;quot;both-sides&amp;quot; erosion is normal and realistic.

This could be a cinematic custom to change scenes or to show the passage of time: fade to black (white) on Act I, come up on Act II. Get some popcorn during the intermission.{{unsigned|Gerry|11:38, 29 April 2013 (UTC)}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The picture does chance with time. The URL includes a changing timestamp that I can't decipher. Compare these two URLS (which have slightly different images:&lt;br /&gt;
http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/8eb156cce408df8bb83528382d6a2aa2ce6c74f3c573fd12b058cd1c56420672.png&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps there is a way to hack the URL to view future images. [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:29, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I would also like to add that knowing randall, these are not the only images. For all we know, the image will still be changing in 5 years while a tree grows in front of them. My point is: Are the URLs hackable, or did he encrypt them? [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:33, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Likely there is a way to hack the URLs; they look like some sort of hash, probably a hashed timestamp. Of course, he could easily have added some salt to the hash, making it significantly *harder* to hack. But they're strings of a specific length, so it should be pretty easy to bruteforce it, fetch all the images, and then (maybe) reverse-engineer the sequence. *That* all depends on how many of them there are.

It seems that the image is updated every 1/2 hour. [[Special:Contributions/152.23.97.150|152.23.97.150]] 06:17, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: Given that the images switch back and forth between other images already seen, and that the comic should be viewable in the future, it seems unlikely that it's any thing like a simple sha256 of part of the timestamp.  I think it's more likely a function of half-hours and minutes (assuming we continue to get a new possible image every half-hour). [[Special:Contributions/99.153.248.206|99.153.248.206]] 06:59, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
::: The images do cycle, yes. But for some reason I have never seen the img where Megan is looking behind her. Also wouldn't it be difficult to show a sequential story (like the rising tide) if the previous images keep cycling ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hash appears to be SHA-256. I tried some obvious hashes (&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;11901&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190_1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190.1&amp;quot;) to no avail. Maybe this is HMAC-SHA256? Also, I would suggest trying Unix timestamps. [[Special:Contributions/131.156.236.149|131.156.236.149]] 06:19, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I've been trying to make educated guesses as to what's being hashed here: http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator ... he could also be using hash(hash2(value)) which would be virtually impossible to crack. [[Special:Contributions/99.153.248.206|99.153.248.206]] 06:59, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's entirely possible that the &amp;quot;hash&amp;quot; is actually randomly generated. Just a thought. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.119.153|129.21.119.153]] 07:03, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regarding sha256. Its most likely some hash of a timestamp, but if he doesnt wants us to crack it, he would have prefixes a password.. sha256('secretcode17:30'). Im just saying, if he doesnt wants us to crack it, we most likely cant.&lt;br /&gt;
I've tested all unixtimestamps from 1300000000 to 1364390334. Also &amp;quot;00:00&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;23:59&amp;quot;, with and without the colon and a load of other formats. {{unsigned|77.243.128.133}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alright, this is probably not going to work, but I'm trying to exploit Randall's awesomeness here. Maybe he decided to take the time-stamps from the user? I don't know if that's even possible... That would then allow people in different time zones to obtain different images simultaneously. (What's the corollary of Godwin's law for a bunch of math-and-science nerds and relativity? Is there one?) Clicking the img src url on the comic's html page, give me this: http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/752687b61523144c61736cd89f8c153dc41e19128f72d78d44947ff800f057fa.png : Never mind.. apparently others see the same image too.&lt;br /&gt;

Is it just me or or did Randall manage to make all of us perform a Denial of Service on xkcd.com, and explainxkcd.com ? xkcd.com seems much slower, and I keep getting &amp;quot;500 Internal server error&amp;quot; when accessing this site (explainxkcd.com).

Earlier today, the server handled all the image redirections. The script you see above went through several mutations (currently at #8), with each mutation it seems that Randall is adding more servers and trying to split the load between them. This is basically how a bot-net works - we all run code written by some evil genius, and he's changing the code as time passes to serve some hidden purpose.&lt;br /&gt;

For those wondering about the Javascript behind this: I posted my analysis of the Javascript [http://www.echochamber.me/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=101043&amp;amp;start=760#p3303579 on the xkcd forums], and further de-obfuscated and annotated the code over on [https://gist.github.com/cincodenada/5246094 GitHub].  Here's a quick summary though: it holds open a connection to xkcd's servers and listens for instructions and follows them. Those instructions are either &amp;quot;load a new image&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;reload the page&amp;quot;. So, you don't have to mash F5, it will automatically update the image when they're available. We have no way to control how fast the images come or when they do, and it's quite possible for them to update forever. --[[User:Fiveofoh|Fiveofoh]] ([[User talk:Fiveofoh|talk]]) 06:41, 27 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

This is a series of animation frames.

Call me a paranoid, but I think this strip is all about 9/11:&lt;br /&gt;
*If you read the strip number (1190) backwards, you get 09/11&lt;br /&gt;
*This subject is recurrent on xkcd&lt;br /&gt;
*As far as we have seen, there is a destroyed tower and they are rebuilding it&lt;br /&gt;
*The next strip, following 1190 (or 09/11), mentions war against countries with large oil reserves but low military capacity. {{unsigned|143.107.105.14}}&lt;br /&gt;
:I feel like that's kind of a stretch, I'm pretty sure it's just a story about a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If a new strip goes up every 30 minutes our time, and if each strip comprises of, let's say for the sake of simplicity, one minute in their time; to build the sand castle [frames 24-117 = 93 frames] so far it's taken almost 2 days our time, which would be about an hour and a half their time if each frame is a minute.  Using my scale, an hour our time is 2 minutes their time, a day is 48 minutes, and our month is their 24 hour day.  If we assume Randall plans to give us a 24 hour period from that world's time, and we use the minute-per-frame rate I made up, than we'd probably be looking at a month of images our time.  I guess we'll just have to see how long he's got it planned to go on. -boB&lt;br /&gt;

I googled some hashes. The first two seem to show up here, in a directory tellingly labeled &amp;quot;wait&amp;quot;: http://www.hash-database.net/wait/hash_sha256.txt&lt;br /&gt;

Right now the link for the skipped update 242 got renamed to the nonexistent time242NA.png and the next update's link is time242.png. But what do we do if the updates are changing to once per hour?

Strange: As far as I know http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time.png always redirects to the current frame. But if you visit the current one (133:00) at http://xkcd.com/1190/ and check the displayed image, it says 'c6976fbb244af4fc2286ffe3ac2cf78d408c1f610ecd71e18b4a677a048f084d.png' while time.png redirects to '1d9ce7199935b1b629d6b8744e62c7700a3780357b2dc74bb70471db616ddadb.png'.

&lt;br /&gt;
I'm seeing some strange stuff now. I have a script that uses wget of time.png to get the redirected hash png like Lockyy is doing. And I can verify that when you go to the 1190 page in the browser you get a different hash. But the previous hour and this hour, unlike the ones before it, the two hash pngs are different. And when I refresh the screen in my browser at the 1190 page, first I see the image I get from time.png, then the image refreshes with the other one. I'm not sure what this means or what we are supposed to do with it. I added the time.png hashes to the table for the last two hours but we probably need a way of indicating the difference. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 20:38, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

: Looking at it some more, I see that wget of the page at xkcd.com/1190/ gets you an img link to time.png and then there is the javascript that must after some delay get the different hash url image. That means that we had better be sure that we do not miss any manual checks of hourly updates because the scripts will never find that second image unless someone has a way of getting a script that runs the javascript as if it was a browser. As long as someone posts the hash of the image from the browser every hour, I can ensure that we have the hashes the scripts can get because I have a cron job checking for those updates every 15 minutes. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 21:49, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

When Megan coughed and Cueball asked if she was okay, did anyone else think of http://xkcd.com/931/ Lanes? Cueball explains that cancer treatment results are not known until much later, &amp;quot;and often the first sign is a cough or a bone pain.  So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry . . . .&amp;quot; ~~wrybred&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:I don't want to be a downer but this is just my interpretation thus far. I hope it is a happier theme but if you are correct wrybred, my further explanation would be the following... I think that building sandcastles is an analogy for living their life. Going for a swim in the body of water and the cough could represent the start of the cancer or possibly some time where they had to go out and &amp;quot;wade&amp;quot; in the possibilities of what cancer could mean. Time passes and Cueball says &amp;quot;I don't think we can build it much taller than this. It's been fun, though&amp;quot; which represents that they believe they have done as well as they can with the lives they have been given. They comment on the river retreating even though we the audience observe a body of water on the right hand side rising could represent how we can be fooled into believing things are going alright when in reality they are not. The reference to not understanding what the river is doing also fits this explanation well as someone with cancer may occasionally feel confused about their illness. Presently while I write this they are possibly preparing for a flood which represents the return of the cancer. If I were to guess what is next I might guess that they will watch as the flood comes in and destroys some of what they built but it is better than not having made the sandcastle in the first place. I could be way off, but Randall has given us a lot of TIME to think about what this is all about and your mind wanders. I also would note that this may not be about a particular cancer story, just any cancer story. [[User:Nhoel|Nhoel]] ([[User talk:Nhoel|talk]]) 13:51, 8 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

I think by tasting the water Cueball was preparing himself for the inevitable - the water is going to continue to rise and nothing they can do will stop it: they are going to drown.

:Seriously? Ok - time to review the physics of hydrostatic fluids, folks.  Depth is the only variable in calculating fluid pressure.

If this were a 2D universe, wouldn't the best course of action be to bury one of the poles directly at the water's edge?

&lt;br /&gt;
I'm guessing that the water will keep rising indefinitely, and we'll be left with an upward-moving strip that occasionally zooms out as the bottom layers are very slowly filled in with black &amp;quot;water.&amp;quot; One thing that would make this interesting is the varying heights of the constructed structures (sandcastle turrets, platform, etc.) which would make the process of &amp;quot;overflow&amp;quot; from the right-hand side interesting to watch. {{unsigned ip|65.96.75.37}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh the symbolism of it: Cueball leaves, Megan finishes building their castle, rests and lets her guard down. The next thing to happen is, a cute girl walks in, sees what the two have built together and leaves. The very next frame, the castle starts to fall apart. [[Special:Contributions/217.81.90.198|217.81.90.198]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm expecting the lower level-castle to be swept away by the water, while the high-level castle will remain intact. This is quite reasonable, assuming Cueball and Megan knows how high the flood will come and thus they built the platform to an appropriate height. It may be interpreted as the lower-level castle being the work of our life, which is inevitable finite, and will be eventually overtaken by death. Recognizing this, some choose to build a castle for the &amp;quot;after-life&amp;quot;. Life-death reflections have been common on xkcd in the past as well. {{unsigned ip|149.241.18.229}}&lt;br /&gt;

For me, this is clearly about cancer and the impacts it has on a relationship over time. Randall's now wife was diagnosed and treated for cancer recently and through this comic, he's trying to portray the anxious wait they faced through treatment and remission.  He has put us into his shoes by keeping us waiting in suspense to see how things end up.  The passing of time represents their life together.  At first it's just them relaxing together, probably the dating phase.  Soon they start building a life together, represented by the sand castle.  The castle evolves over time, much like their life has.  Difficulties and gaffes in their relationship are depicted, for example when cueball trips and breaks down part of the wall.  Eventually all efforts are diverted and put into defending against the approaching sea, which represents the cancer.  The wall, the platform, all represent the steps taken to prevent and/or prepare for it's impending progress.  The river represents the cure for cancer, which is still pretty far out, as cueball mentioned.  There are many many more clues I see and explanations I can give to support this idea (castle in the sky, the rain, progress with research, etc.), but this is just starting point.  I'm excited to see where the comic will end up, but I guess we just need to &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;.  --[[User:Nick|Nick]] ([[User talk:Nick|talk]]) 21:25, 24 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

The cancer metaphors are quite intriguing, but my take is environmental, possibly pollution and global warming. The French girl (beret) could be a nod to the Disneyland Paris castle.

I'm taking it that &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; is a phonetic substitute for &amp;quot;c,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;meaning &amp;quot;cancer.&amp;quot;  For better or worse, this kind of phoenetic clue was used in the Batman movie:&lt;br /&gt;

Well, I don't know if the intention here is that the &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; is making the &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; grow.  My point is that the dialogue is so nonsensical at points that it seems to be code.  I'm taking every noun as a metaphor for something.  &amp;quot;Sea&amp;quot; being &amp;quot;cancer&amp;quot; seems to fit (&amp;quot;The cancer can't make more of itself forever, can it?&amp;quot;)  I guess go back through the dialogue and see what other words could substitute for what they're saying.  Like I said, I don't know what &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;rain&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ground&amp;quot; could be in this metaphor.

I agree - the water has started eroding the castle to the right, and it makes sense for the erosion to potentially loop the comic back to frame 1. That said, the title text was &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;. This could be a euphamism suggesting &amp;quot;keep waiting, this comic changes&amp;quot;, but it does have an implication that there is a &amp;quot;finale&amp;quot; to the comic that you should wait for.

The most recent event is Megan walking in, saying &amp;quot;bye!&amp;quot; in *lower case*, and leaving.  From the lower case, which is different from the rest of the comic, I infer that she was talking to *us*, not (eg) herself or the sandcastle!  I reckon it's just going to fill up with water until the page is a static black rectangle. Especially since she and Cueball just talked about going off and exploring, grabbed their bags, and left. -cosmogoblin [[Special:Contributions/94.197.127.235|94.197.127.235]] 13:57, 26 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

The picture does chance with time. The URL includes a changing timestamp that I can't decipher. Compare these two URLS (which have slightly different images:&lt;br /&gt;
http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/8eb156cce408df8bb83528382d6a2aa2ce6c74f3c573fd12b058cd1c56420672.png&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps there is a way to hack the URL to view future images. [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:29, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I would also like to add that knowing randall, these are not the only images. For all we know, the image will still be changing in 5 years while a tree grows in front of them. My point is: Are the URLs hackable, or did he encrypt them? [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:33, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Likely there is a way to hack the URLs; they look like some sort of hash, probably a hashed timestamp. Of course, he could easily have added some salt to the hash, making it significantly *harder* to hack. But they're strings of a specific length, so it should be pretty easy to bruteforce it, fetch all the images, and then (maybe) reverse-engineer the sequence. *That* all depends on how many of them there are.

: Given that the images switch back and forth between other images already seen, and that the comic should be viewable in the future, it seems unlikely that it's any thing like a simple sha256 of part of the timestamp.  I think it's more likely a function of half-hours and minutes (assuming we continue to get a new possible image every half-hour).

::: The images do cycle, yes. But for some reason I have never seen the img where Megan is looking behind her. Also wouldn't it be difficult to show a sequential story (like the rising tide) if the previous images keep cycling ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hash appears to be SHA-256. I tried some obvious hashes (&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;11901&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190_1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190.1&amp;quot;) to no avail. Maybe this is HMAC-SHA256? Also, I would suggest trying Unix timestamps. [[Special:Contributions/131.156.236.149|131.156.236.149]] 06:19, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
It's entirely possible that the &amp;quot;hash&amp;quot; is actually randomly generated. Just a thought. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.119.153|129.21.119.153]] 07:03, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regarding sha256. Its most likely some hash of a timestamp, but if he doesnt wants us to crack it, he would have prefixes a password.. sha256('secretcode17:30'). Im just saying, if he doesnt wants us to crack it, we most likely cant.&lt;br /&gt;
I've tested all unixtimestamps from 1300000000 to 1364390334. Also &amp;quot;00:00&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;23:59&amp;quot;, with and without the colon and a load of other formats. {{unsigned|77.243.128.133}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alright, this is probably not going to work, but I'm trying to exploit Randall's awesomeness here. Maybe he decided to take the time-stamps from the user? I don't know if that's even possible... That would then allow people in different time zones to obtain different images simultaneously. (What's the corollary of Godwin's law for a bunch of math-and-science nerds and relativity? Is there one?) Clicking the img src url on the comic's html page, give me this: http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/752687b61523144c61736cd89f8c153dc41e19128f72d78d44947ff800f057fa.png : Never mind.. apparently others see the same image too.&lt;br /&gt;

::::: The script seems to poll the server every minute or two. It's different from before, where the image server itself redirected to the correct image. The auto refresh was probably always intended, but not quite ready when the comic went live. It may have turned out to be necessary too, so the image server doesn't have to do all the work.

Is it just me or or did Randall manage to make all of us perform a Denial of Service on xkcd.com, and explainxkcd.com ? xkcd.com seems much slower, and I keep getting &amp;quot;500 Internal server error&amp;quot; when accessing this site (explainxkcd.com). I guess that's the effect of having everybody hit F5 every few minutes :) [[Special:Contributions/193.239.192.194|193.239.192.194]] 11:57, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Earlier today, the server handled all the image redirections. The script you see above went through several mutations (currently at #8), with each mutation it seems that Randall is adding more servers and trying to split the load between them. This is basically how a bot-net works - we all run code written by some evil genius, and he's changing the code as time passes to serve some hidden purpose.&lt;br /&gt;

When I saw this comic last night and that there was no explanation up, I thought to myself &amp;quot;How zen.&amp;quot;  I figured that Randall was going through a calm streak before throwing us the utterly ridiculous April 1st comic.

For those wondering about the Javascript behind this: I posted my analysis of the Javascript [http://www.echochamber.me/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=101043&amp;amp;start=760#p3303579 on the xkcd forums], and further de-obfuscated and annotated the code over on [https://gist.github.com/cincodenada/5246094 GitHub].  Here's a quick summary though: it holds open a connection to xkcd's servers and listens for instructions and follows them. Those instructions are either &amp;quot;load a new image&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;reload the page&amp;quot;. So, you don't have to mash F5, it will automatically update the image when they're available. We have no way to control how fast the images come or when they do, and it's quite possible for them to update forever. --[[User:Fiveofoh|Fiveofoh]] ([[User talk:Fiveofoh|talk]]) 06:41, 27 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

This is a series of animation frames.

Call me a paranoid, but I think this strip is all about 9/11:&lt;br /&gt;
*If you read the strip number (1190) backwards, you get 09/11&lt;br /&gt;
*This subject is recurrent on xkcd&lt;br /&gt;
*As far as we have seen, there is a destroyed tower and they are rebuilding it&lt;br /&gt;
*The next strip, following 1190 (or 09/11), mentions war against countries with large oil reserves but low military capacity. {{unsigned|143.107.105.14}}&lt;br /&gt;
:I feel like that's kind of a stretch, I'm pretty sure it's just a story about a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If a new strip goes up every 30 minutes our time, and if each strip comprises of, let's say for the sake of simplicity, one minute in their time; to build the sand castle [frames 24-117 = 93 frames] so far it's taken almost 2 days our time, which would be about an hour and a half their time if each frame is a minute.  Using my scale, an hour our time is 2 minutes their time, a day is 48 minutes, and our month is their 24 hour day.  If we assume Randall plans to give us a 24 hour period from that world's time, and we use the minute-per-frame rate I made up, than we'd probably be looking at a month of images our time.  I guess we'll just have to see how long he's got it planned to go on. -boB&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Has it ended? All that's left is the sandcastle, and there doesn't seem to have been anything else changed on it for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's zooming out! When look at the gifs showing the frames in succession, the last 3 show the castle getting slightly smaller each time!&lt;br /&gt;
: It's true! The most recent also shows the edge of another castle, leading me to believe it's part of some kind of sand castle contest, probably including some of xkcd's other recurring characters!&lt;br /&gt;

Strange: As far as I know http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time.png always redirects to the current frame. But if you visit the current one (133:00) at http://xkcd.com/1190/ and check the displayed image, it says 'c6976fbb244af4fc2286ffe3ac2cf78d408c1f610ecd71e18b4a677a048f084d.png' while time.png redirects to '1d9ce7199935b1b629d6b8744e62c7700a3780357b2dc74bb70471db616ddadb.png'.

I'm seeing some strange stuff now. I have a script that uses wget of time.png to get the redirected hash png like Lockyy is doing. And I can verify that when you go to the 1190 page in the browser you get a different hash. But the previous hour and this hour, unlike the ones before it, the two hash pngs are different. And when I refresh the screen in my browser at the 1190 page, first I see the image I get from time.png, then the image refreshes with the other one. I'm not sure what this means or what we are supposed to do with it. I added the time.png hashes to the table for the last two hours but we probably need a way of indicating the difference. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 20:38, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: This latest hourly update did the same thing. If you are fast enough you can even get the first image in your browser by right click view image before it changes to the second one.

: Looking at it some more, I see that wget of the page at xkcd.com/1190/ gets you an img link to time.png and then there is the javascript that must after some delay get the different hash url image. That means that we had better be sure that we do not miss any manual checks of hourly updates because the scripts will never find that second image unless someone has a way of getting a script that runs the javascript as if it was a browser. As long as someone posts the hash of the image from the browser every hour, I can ensure that we have the hashes the scripts can get because I have a cron job checking for those updates every 15 minutes. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 21:49, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

When Megan coughed and Cueball asked if she was okay, did anyone else think of http://xkcd.com/931/ Lanes? Cueball explains that cancer treatment results are not known until much later, &amp;quot;and often the first sign is a cough or a bone pain.  So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry . . . .&amp;quot; ~~wrybred&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:I don't want to be a downer but this is just my interpretation thus far. I hope it is a happier theme but if you are correct wrybred, my further explanation would be the following... I think that building sandcastles is an analogy for living their life. Going for a swim in the body of water and the cough could represent the start of the cancer or possibly some time where they had to go out and &amp;quot;wade&amp;quot; in the possibilities of what cancer could mean. Time passes and Cueball says &amp;quot;I don't think we can build it much taller than this. It's been fun, though&amp;quot; which represents that they believe they have done as well as they can with the lives they have been given. They comment on the river retreating even though we the audience observe a body of water on the right hand side rising could represent how we can be fooled into believing things are going alright when in reality they are not. The reference to not understanding what the river is doing also fits this explanation well as someone with cancer may occasionally feel confused about their illness. Presently while I write this they are possibly preparing for a flood which represents the return of the cancer. If I were to guess what is next I might guess that they will watch as the flood comes in and destroys some of what they built but it is better than not having made the sandcastle in the first place. I could be way off, but Randall has given us a lot of TIME to think about what this is all about and your mind wanders. I also would note that this may not be about a particular cancer story, just any cancer story. [[User:Nhoel|Nhoel]] ([[User talk:Nhoel|talk]]) 13:51, 8 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

In the frame-by-frame breakdown, the &amp;quot;Image&amp;quot; field simply gives the time in hours, while the &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; field gives the time in days+hours.  It would be helpful if the &amp;quot;Image&amp;quot; field instead gave an ordinal number indicating the number of frames (e.g., this would help to correlate the Transcript on this page with the frame numbers [http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/ here].  The current &amp;quot;Image&amp;quot; field need not be deleted (I personally prefer time in hours to time in days+hours), but it might be relabeled as &amp;quot;Time in Hours&amp;quot;.  Implementing this would require some use of scripts, and would be best if adopted by the person updating the frame-by-frame breakdown in the first place.

When the server had a problem one image was 100 minutes late, and another was 50 minutes late. Because of this there was a file between time682 and time683 that wasn't posted here (time683 should have been time684), and many files after that are displayed here an hour before they should have been displayed, with the wrong filename. It also affects xkcd-time.wikia.com as I had got many of the files on there from here. I am currently trying to correct this.

I'm guessing that the water will keep rising indefinitely, and we'll be left with an upward-moving strip that occasionally zooms out as the bottom layers are very slowly filled in with black &amp;quot;water.&amp;quot; One thing that would make this interesting is the varying heights of the constructed structures (sandcastle turrets, platform, etc.) which would make the process of &amp;quot;overflow&amp;quot; from the right-hand side interesting to watch. {{unsigned ip|65.96.75.37}}&lt;br /&gt;

Oh the symbolism of it: Cueball leaves, Megan finishes building their castle, rests and lets her guard down. The next thing to happen is, a cute girl walks in, sees what the two have built together and leaves. The very next frame, the castle starts to fall apart. [[Special:Contributions/217.81.90.198|217.81.90.198]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm expecting the lower level-castle to be swept away by the water, while the high-level castle will remain intact. This is quite reasonable, assuming Cueball and Megan knows how high the flood will come and thus they built the platform to an appropriate height. It may be interpreted as the lower-level castle being the work of our life, which is inevitable finite, and will be eventually overtaken by death. Recognizing this, some choose to build a castle for the &amp;quot;after-life&amp;quot;. Life-death reflections have been common on xkcd in the past as well. {{unsigned ip|149.241.18.229}}&lt;br /&gt;

For me, this is clearly about cancer and the impacts it has on a relationship over time. Randall's now wife was diagnosed and treated for cancer recently and through this comic, he's trying to portray the anxious wait they faced through treatment and remission.  He has put us into his shoes by keeping us waiting in suspense to see how things end up.  The passing of time represents their life together.  At first it's just them relaxing together, probably the dating phase.  Soon they start building a life together, represented by the sand castle.  The castle evolves over time, much like their life has.  Difficulties and gaffes in their relationship are depicted, for example when cueball trips and breaks down part of the wall.  Eventually all efforts are diverted and put into defending against the approaching sea, which represents the cancer.  The wall, the platform, all represent the steps taken to prevent and/or prepare for it's impending progress.  The river represents the cure for cancer, which is still pretty far out, as cueball mentioned.  There are many many more clues I see and explanations I can give to support this idea (castle in the sky, the rain, progress with research, etc.), but this is just starting point.  I'm excited to see where the comic will end up, but I guess we just need to &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;.  --[[User:Nick|Nick]] ([[User talk:Nick|talk]]) 21:25, 24 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

The cancer metaphors are quite intriguing, but my take is environmental, possibly pollution and global warming. The French girl (beret) could be a nod to the Disneyland Paris castle.

I'm taking it that &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; is a phonetic substitute for &amp;quot;c,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;meaning &amp;quot;cancer.&amp;quot;  For better or worse, this kind of phoenetic clue was used in the Batman movie:&lt;br /&gt;

Well, I don't know if the intention here is that the &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; is making the &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; grow.  My point is that the dialogue is so nonsensical at points that it seems to be code.  I'm taking every noun as a metaphor for something.  &amp;quot;Sea&amp;quot; being &amp;quot;cancer&amp;quot; seems to fit (&amp;quot;The cancer can't make more of itself forever, can it?&amp;quot;)  I guess go back through the dialogue and see what other words could substitute for what they're saying.  Like I said, I don't know what &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;rain&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ground&amp;quot; could be in this metaphor.

I agree - the water has started eroding the castle to the right, and it makes sense for the erosion to potentially loop the comic back to frame 1. That said, the title text was &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;. This could be a euphamism suggesting &amp;quot;keep waiting, this comic changes&amp;quot;, but it does have an implication that there is a &amp;quot;finale&amp;quot; to the comic that you should wait for.

The most recent event is Megan walking in, saying &amp;quot;bye!&amp;quot; in *lower case*, and leaving.  From the lower case, which is different from the rest of the comic, I infer that she was talking to *us*, not (eg) herself or the sandcastle!  I reckon it's just going to fill up with water until the page is a static black rectangle. Especially since she and Cueball just talked about going off and exploring, grabbed their bags, and left. -cosmogoblin [[Special:Contributions/94.197.127.235|94.197.127.235]] 13:57, 26 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

The picture does chance with time. The URL includes a changing timestamp that I can't decipher. Compare these two URLS (which have slightly different images:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps there is a way to hack the URL to view future images. [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:29, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I would also like to add that knowing randall, these are not the only images. For all we know, the image will still be changing in 5 years while a tree grows in front of them.

&lt;br /&gt;
Likely there is a way to hack the URLs; they look like some sort of hash, probably a hashed timestamp. Of course, he could easily have added some salt to the hash, making it significantly *harder* to hack. But they're strings of a specific length, so it should be pretty easy to bruteforce it, fetch all the images, and then (maybe) reverse-engineer the sequence. *That* all depends on how many of them there are.

It seems that the image is updated every 1/2 hour. [[Special:Contributions/152.23.97.150|152.23.97.150]] 06:17, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: Given that the images switch back and forth between other images already seen, and that the comic should be viewable in the future, it seems unlikely that it's any thing like a simple sha256 of part of the timestamp.  I think it's more likely a function of half-hours and minutes (assuming we continue to get a new possible image every half-hour). [[Special:Contributions/99.153.248.206|99.153.248.206]] 06:59, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

::: The images do cycle, yes. But for some reason I have never seen the img where Megan is looking behind her. Also wouldn't it be difficult to show a sequential story (like the rising tide) if the previous images keep cycling ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hash appears to be SHA-256. I tried some obvious hashes (&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;11901&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190_1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190.1&amp;quot;) to no avail. Maybe this is HMAC-SHA256? Also, I would suggest trying Unix timestamps. [[Special:Contributions/131.156.236.149|131.156.236.149]] 06:19, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

It's entirely possible that the &amp;quot;hash&amp;quot; is actually randomly generated. Just a thought. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.119.153|129.21.119.153]] 07:03, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regarding sha256. Its most likely some hash of a timestamp, but if he doesnt wants us to crack it, he would have prefixes a password.. sha256('secretcode17:30'). Im just saying, if he doesnt wants us to crack it, we most likely cant.&lt;br /&gt;
I've tested all unixtimestamps from 1300000000 to 1364390334. Also &amp;quot;00:00&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;23:59&amp;quot;, with and without the colon and a load of other formats. {{unsigned|77.243.128.133}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alright, this is probably not going to work, but I'm trying to exploit Randall's awesomeness here. Maybe he decided to take the time-stamps from the user? I don't know if that's even possible... That would then allow people in different time zones to obtain different images simultaneously. (What's the corollary of Godwin's law for a bunch of math-and-science nerds and relativity? Is there one?) Clicking the img src url on the comic's html page, give me this: http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/752687b61523144c61736cd89f8c153dc41e19128f72d78d44947ff800f057fa.png : Never mind.. apparently others see the same image too.&lt;br /&gt;

Is it just me or or did Randall manage to make all of us perform a Denial of Service on xkcd.com, and explainxkcd.com ? xkcd.com seems much slower, and I keep getting &amp;quot;500 Internal server error&amp;quot; when accessing this site (explainxkcd.com). I guess that's the effect of having everybody hit F5 every few minutes :) [[Special:Contributions/193.239.192.194|193.239.192.194]] 11:57, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Earlier today, the server handled all the image redirections. The script you see above went through several mutations (currently at #8), with each mutation it seems that Randall is adding more servers and trying to split the load between them. This is basically how a bot-net works - we all run code written by some evil genius, and he's changing the code as time passes to serve some hidden purpose.&lt;br /&gt;

:Probably like this: http://xkcd.com/350/&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I saw this comic last night and that there was no explanation up, I thought to myself &amp;quot;How zen.&amp;quot;  I figured that Randall was going through a calm streak before throwing us the utterly ridiculous April 1st comic.  Did it come early, or does he have something even bigger planned for us? [[Special:Contributions/76.106.251.87|76.106.251.87]] 07:05, 26 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Of course, it is now &amp;quot;now&amp;quot; and there &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; an explanation, so that should answer your question.  Also, since it's not April 1st, and Randall has consistently released something major on that day, the jury is still out, leaving my question quite open (though I was really only asking for opinions).

If this is compressed header-less data there wouldn't likely be any easily discernible patterns.

For those wondering about the Javascript behind this: I posted my analysis of the Javascript [http://www.echochamber.me/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=101043&amp;amp;start=760#p3303579 on the xkcd forums], and further de-obfuscated and annotated the code over on [https://gist.github.com/cincodenada/5246094 GitHub].  Here's a quick summary though: it holds open a connection to xkcd's servers and listens for instructions and follows them. Those instructions are either &amp;quot;load a new image&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;reload the page&amp;quot;. So, you don't have to mash F5, it will automatically update the image when they're available. We have no way to control how fast the images come or when they do, and it's quite possible for them to update forever. --[[User:Fiveofoh|Fiveofoh]] ([[User talk:Fiveofoh|talk]]) 06:41, 27 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

This is a series of animation frames. I suspect they will only ever be shown once (based on the fact you can only get the current image, not previous or future images -- this is in keeping with the title, &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot;, which passes and which you can't ever get back]. The filenames are UUIDs too long to guess, so somebody needs to start collecting the filenames here so that a proper flipbook can be assembled.

Call me a paranoid, but I think this strip is all about 9/11:&lt;br /&gt;
*If you read the strip number (1190) backwards, you get 09/11&lt;br /&gt;
*This subject is recurrent on xkcd&lt;br /&gt;
*As far as we have seen, there is a destroyed tower and they are rebuilding it&lt;br /&gt;
*The next strip, following 1190 (or 09/11), mentions war against countries with large oil reserves but low military capacity. {{unsigned|143.107.105.14}}&lt;br /&gt;
:I feel like that's kind of a stretch, I'm pretty sure it's just a story about a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If a new strip goes up every 30 minutes our time, and if each strip comprises of, let's say for the sake of simplicity, one minute in their time; to build the sand castle [frames 24-117 = 93 frames] so far it's taken almost 2 days our time, which would be about an hour and a half their time if each frame is a minute.  Using my scale, an hour our time is 2 minutes their time, a day is 48 minutes, and our month is their 24 hour day.  If we assume Randall plans to give us a 24 hour period from that world's time, and we use the minute-per-frame rate I made up, than we'd probably be looking at a month of images our time.  I guess we'll just have to see how long he's got it planned to go on. -boB&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Has it ended? All that's left is the sandcastle, and there doesn't seem to have been anything else changed on it for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's zooming out! When look at the gifs showing the frames in succession, the last 3 show the castle getting slightly smaller each time!&lt;br /&gt;
: It's true! The most recent also shows the edge of another castle, leading me to believe it's part of some kind of sand castle contest, probably including some of xkcd's other recurring characters!&lt;br /&gt;
