Optimistic [[Beret Guy]] can never take life seriously. He loves to play with everything, and nothing is more exciting than a tool that sticks things together with an impressive &amp;quot;kaChunk&amp;quot; sound when he pulls the trigger, even on things that shouldn't be stapled.&lt;br /&gt;

The title text refers to duct tape, which, with its combination of tensile and adhesive strength, is commonly regarded as the ultimate do-it-yourself repair tool.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Here's a list of all the blurry text from the translator, both with the original image and enhanced contrast.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A note about grammar:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* The punctuation appears to be borrowed from the translator's native language.&lt;br /&gt;
* The ring diacritic indicates a question mark.&lt;br /&gt;
* A single line above a letter is a full stop.&lt;br /&gt;
* A double line above a letter is an exclamation mark (or probably a comma).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This might help in determining the native language a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;

[[Special:Contributions/72.21.198.66|72.21.198.66]] 05:11, 25 March 2013 (UTC)It could be a reference to the old proverb &amp;quot; time and tide wait for none&amp;quot; Cueball and the girl could be waiting for the tide in the beach! (Just a guess)[[Special:Contributions/72.21.198.66|72.21.198.66]] 05:11, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

This could be a cinematic custom to change scenes or to show the passage of time: fade to black (white) on Act I, come up on Act II. Get some popcorn during the intermission.{{unsigned|Gerry|11:38, 29 April 2013 (UTC)}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The picture does chance with time. The URL includes a changing timestamp that I can't decipher. Compare these two URLS (which have slightly different images:&lt;br /&gt;
http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/8eb156cce408df8bb83528382d6a2aa2ce6c74f3c573fd12b058cd1c56420672.png&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps there is a way to hack the URL to view future images. [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:29, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I would also like to add that knowing randall, these are not the only images. For all we know, the image will still be changing in 5 years while a tree grows in front of them. My point is: Are the URLs hackable, or did he encrypt them? [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:33, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Likely there is a way to hack the URLs; they look like some sort of hash, probably a hashed timestamp. Of course, he could easily have added some salt to the hash, making it significantly *harder* to hack. But they're strings of a specific length, so it should be pretty easy to bruteforce it, fetch all the images, and then (maybe) reverse-engineer the sequence. *That* all depends on how many of them there are. [[Special:Contributions/76.90.249.178|76.90.249.178]] 05:44, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
:Good god, do you see how many digits are *in* that hash? The sun'll have burned out by the time we've tested every possible combination of digits. '''[[User:Davidy22|&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;{{Color|purple|David}}&amp;lt;font color=green size=3px&amp;gt;y&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;&amp;lt;font color=indigo size=4px&amp;gt;²²&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;]]'''[[User talk:Davidy22|&amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;[talk]&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt;]] 05:47, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It seems that the image is updated every 1/2 hour. [[Special:Contributions/152.23.97.150|152.23.97.150]] 06:17, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: Given that the images switch back and forth between other images already seen, and that the comic should be viewable in the future, it seems unlikely that it's any thing like a simple sha256 of part of the timestamp.  I think it's more likely a function of half-hours and minutes (assuming we continue to get a new possible image every half-hour). [[Special:Contributions/99.153.248.206|99.153.248.206]] 06:59, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
::: The images do cycle, yes. But for some reason I have never seen the img where Megan is looking behind her. Also wouldn't it be difficult to show a sequential story (like the rising tide) if the previous images keep cycling ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hash appears to be SHA-256. I tried some obvious hashes (&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;11901&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190_1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190.1&amp;quot;) to no avail. Maybe this is HMAC-SHA256? Also, I would suggest trying Unix timestamps. [[Special:Contributions/131.156.236.149|131.156.236.149]] 06:19, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I've been trying to make educated guesses as to what's being hashed here: http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator ... he could also be using hash(hash2(value)) which would be virtually impossible to crack. [[Special:Contributions/99.153.248.206|99.153.248.206]] 06:59, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's entirely possible that the &amp;quot;hash&amp;quot; is actually randomly generated. Just a thought. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.119.153|129.21.119.153]] 07:03, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regarding sha256. Its most likely some hash of a timestamp, but if he doesnt wants us to crack it, he would have prefixes a password.. sha256('secretcode17:30'). Im just saying, if he doesnt wants us to crack it, we most likely cant.&lt;br /&gt;
I've tested all unixtimestamps from 1300000000 to 1364390334. Also &amp;quot;00:00&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;23:59&amp;quot;, with and without the colon and a load of other formats. {{unsigned|77.243.128.133}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alright, this is probably not going to work, but I'm trying to exploit Randall's awesomeness here. Maybe he decided to take the time-stamps from the user? I don't know if that's even possible... That would then allow people in different time zones to obtain different images simultaneously. (What's the corollary of Godwin's law for a bunch of math-and-science nerds and relativity? Is there one?) Clicking the img src url on the comic's html page, give me this: http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/752687b61523144c61736cd89f8c153dc41e19128f72d78d44947ff800f057fa.png : Never mind.. apparently others see the same image too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Could he be doing this live? Monitoring the discussion on the net? Collaborative, crowdsourced comic-ing? Reminds me of those you-decide-what-the-character-does-next-and-flip-to-appropriate-page parallel plot novels.&lt;br /&gt;

:Doesn't really help. The script basically changes the image when something happens (probably some time passes, although it's possible there is more hidden there). WHAT image then appears is not directed by the script, but by the site. Specifically, the image displayed as first is taken from [http://c0.xkcd.com/redirect/comic/time http://c0.xkcd.com/redirect/comic/time], while the script asks for [http://c0.xkcd.com/stream/comic/time?method=EventSource&amp;amp;r=(somenumber) http://c0.xkcd.com/stream/comic/time?method=EventSource&amp;amp;r=(somenumber)] ... which is, if you get correct &amp;quot;r&amp;quot;, probably some json containing the image url.

Is it just me or or did Randall manage to make all of us perform a Denial of Service on xkcd.com, and explainxkcd.com ? xkcd.com seems much slower, and I keep getting &amp;quot;500 Internal server error&amp;quot; when accessing this site (explainxkcd.com). I guess that's the effect of having everybody hit F5 every few minutes :) [[Special:Contributions/193.239.192.194|193.239.192.194]] 11:57, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Earlier today, the server handled all the image redirections. The script you see above went through several mutations (currently at #8), with each mutation it seems that Randall is adding more servers and trying to split the load between them. This is basically how a bot-net works - we all run code written by some evil genius, and he's changing the code as time passes to serve some hidden purpose.&lt;br /&gt;

When I saw this comic last night and that there was no explanation up, I thought to myself &amp;quot;How zen.&amp;quot;  I figured that Randall was going through a calm streak before throwing us the utterly ridiculous April 1st comic.

For those wondering about the Javascript behind this: I posted my analysis of the Javascript [http://www.echochamber.me/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=101043&amp;amp;start=760#p3303579 on the xkcd forums], and further de-obfuscated and annotated the code over on [https://gist.github.com/cincodenada/5246094 GitHub].  Here's a quick summary though: it holds open a connection to xkcd's servers and listens for instructions and follows them. Those instructions are either &amp;quot;load a new image&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;reload the page&amp;quot;. So, you don't have to mash F5, it will automatically update the image when they're available. We have no way to control how fast the images come or when they do, and it's quite possible for them to update forever. --[[User:Fiveofoh|Fiveofoh]] ([[User talk:Fiveofoh|talk]]) 06:41, 27 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

This is a series of animation frames. I suspect they will only ever be shown once (based on the fact you can only get the current image, not previous or future images -- this is in keeping with the title, &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot;, which passes and which you can't ever get back]. The filenames are UUIDs too long to guess, so somebody needs to start collecting the filenames here so that a proper flipbook can be assembled.

Call me a paranoid, but I think this strip is all about 9/11:&lt;br /&gt;
*If you read the strip number (1190) backwards, you get 09/11&lt;br /&gt;
*This subject is recurrent on xkcd&lt;br /&gt;
*As far as we have seen, there is a destroyed tower and they are rebuilding it&lt;br /&gt;
*The next strip, following 1190 (or 09/11), mentions war against countries with large oil reserves but low military capacity. {{unsigned|143.107.105.14}}&lt;br /&gt;
:I feel like that's kind of a stretch, I'm pretty sure it's just a story about a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If a new strip goes up every 30 minutes our time, and if each strip comprises of, let's say for the sake of simplicity, one minute in their time; to build the sand castle [frames 24-117 = 93 frames] so far it's taken almost 2 days our time, which would be about an hour and a half their time if each frame is a minute.  Using my scale, an hour our time is 2 minutes their time, a day is 48 minutes, and our month is their 24 hour day.  If we assume Randall plans to give us a 24 hour period from that world's time, and we use the minute-per-frame rate I made up, than we'd probably be looking at a month of images our time.  I guess we'll just have to see how long he's got it planned to go on. -boB&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Has it ended? All that's left is the sandcastle, and there doesn't seem to have been anything else changed on it for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's zooming out! When look at the gifs showing the frames in succession, the last 3 show the castle getting slightly smaller each time!&lt;br /&gt;
: It's true! The most recent also shows the edge of another castle, leading me to believe it's part of some kind of sand castle contest, probably including some of xkcd's other recurring characters!&lt;br /&gt;

Does anyone have an opinion on how we should continue naming the saved timeNN.png files if the updates do not continue on the half hour?&lt;br /&gt;
Right now the link for the skipped update 242 got renamed to the nonexistent time242NA.png and the next update's link is time242.png. But what do we do if the updates are changing to once per hour? By the way it does look like the next half-hour update has been skipped too. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 05:57, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
:It does seem to have gone hourly as of midnight EDT. I stuck in &amp;quot;NA&amp;quot; as a placeholder since I wasn't sure what to do with the files, and wanted to make it clear that the half-hour updates were skipped in case it goes back or changes in some other way. Maybe start naming them by the time, instead of sequentially, e.g. &amp;quot;012200.png&amp;quot;. If the pattern holds, the &amp;quot;no update&amp;quot; lines can be removed.

Strange: As far as I know http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time.png always redirects to the current frame. But if you visit the current one (133:00) at http://xkcd.com/1190/ and check the displayed image, it says 'c6976fbb244af4fc2286ffe3ac2cf78d408c1f610ecd71e18b4a677a048f084d.png' while time.png redirects to '1d9ce7199935b1b629d6b8744e62c7700a3780357b2dc74bb70471db616ddadb.png'.

&lt;br /&gt;
I'm seeing some strange stuff now. I have a script that uses wget of time.png to get the redirected hash png like Lockyy is doing. And I can verify that when you go to the 1190 page in the browser you get a different hash. But the previous hour and this hour, unlike the ones before it, the two hash pngs are different. And when I refresh the screen in my browser at the 1190 page, first I see the image I get from time.png, then the image refreshes with the other one. I'm not sure what this means or what we are supposed to do with it. I added the time.png hashes to the table for the last two hours but we probably need a way of indicating the difference. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 20:38, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

: Looking at it some more, I see that wget of the page at xkcd.com/1190/ gets you an img link to time.png and then there is the javascript that must after some delay get the different hash url image. That means that we had better be sure that we do not miss any manual checks of hourly updates because the scripts will never find that second image unless someone has a way of getting a script that runs the javascript as if it was a browser. As long as someone posts the hash of the image from the browser every hour, I can ensure that we have the hashes the scripts can get because I have a cron job checking for those updates every 15 minutes. -- [[User:Bugstomper|Bugstomper]] ([[User talk:Bugstomper|talk]]) 21:49, 30 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

When Megan coughed and Cueball asked if she was okay, did anyone else think of http://xkcd.com/931/ Lanes? Cueball explains that cancer treatment results are not known until much later, &amp;quot;and often the first sign is a cough or a bone pain.  So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry . . . .&amp;quot; ~~wrybred&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:I don't want to be a downer but this is just my interpretation thus far. I hope it is a happier theme but if you are correct wrybred, my further explanation would be the following... I think that building sandcastles is an analogy for living their life. Going for a swim in the body of water and the cough could represent the start of the cancer or possibly some time where they had to go out and &amp;quot;wade&amp;quot; in the possibilities of what cancer could mean. Time passes and Cueball says &amp;quot;I don't think we can build it much taller than this. It's been fun, though&amp;quot; which represents that they believe they have done as well as they can with the lives they have been given. They comment on the river retreating even though we the audience observe a body of water on the right hand side rising could represent how we can be fooled into believing things are going alright when in reality they are not. The reference to not understanding what the river is doing also fits this explanation well as someone with cancer may occasionally feel confused about their illness. Presently while I write this they are possibly preparing for a flood which represents the return of the cancer. If I were to guess what is next I might guess that they will watch as the flood comes in and destroys some of what they built but it is better than not having made the sandcastle in the first place. I could be way off, but Randall has given us a lot of TIME to think about what this is all about and your mind wanders. I also would note that this may not be about a particular cancer story, just any cancer story. [[User:Nhoel|Nhoel]] ([[User talk:Nhoel|talk]]) 13:51, 8 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

I think by tasting the water Cueball was preparing himself for the inevitable - the water is going to continue to rise and nothing they can do will stop it: they are going to drown. This strip is about the slow, inextirpable, approach of Death - and this isn't the Death from a Terry Pratchett novel.

: Between the 376th and the 81st strip it can be noted how much the water has rised. And I've noted how there's no wind in the beach (river's mouth?), the flags don't move and the sea has no waves.

:::The likely implication of the lack waves etc is that they are in an estuarine environment, where the rising tide may not have a bore at all.

:Seriously? Ok - time to review the physics of hydrostatic fluids, folks.  Depth is the only variable in calculating fluid pressure.

Lending some weight to the 2D or nearly 2D nature is that the first platform they put up was installed on only two posts. But the platform itself had width.

If this were a 2D universe, wouldn't the best course of action be to bury one of the poles directly at the water's edge?

Oh the symbolism of it: Cueball leaves, Megan finishes building their castle, rests and lets her guard down.

It may be interpreted as the lower-level castle being the work of our life, which is inevitable finite, and will be eventually overtaken by death. Recognizing this, some choose to build a castle for the &amp;quot;after-life&amp;quot;. Life-death reflections have been common on xkcd in the past as well. {{unsigned ip|149.241.18.229}}&lt;br /&gt;

For me, this is clearly about cancer and the impacts it has on a relationship over time. Randall's now wife was diagnosed and treated for cancer recently and through this comic, he's trying to portray the anxious wait they faced through treatment and remission.  He has put us into his shoes by keeping us waiting in suspense to see how things end up.  The passing of time represents their life together.  At first it's just them relaxing together, probably the dating phase.  Soon they start building a life together, represented by the sand castle.  The castle evolves over time, much like their life has.  Difficulties and gaffes in their relationship are depicted, for example when cueball trips and breaks down part of the wall.  Eventually all efforts are diverted and put into defending against the approaching sea, which represents the cancer.  The wall, the platform, all represent the steps taken to prevent and/or prepare for it's impending progress.  The river represents the cure for cancer, which is still pretty far out, as cueball mentioned.  There are many many more clues I see and explanations I can give to support this idea (castle in the sky, the rain, progress with research, etc.), but this is just starting point.  I'm excited to see where the comic will end up, but I guess we just need to &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;.  --[[User:Nick|Nick]] ([[User talk:Nick|talk]]) 21:25, 24 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

The cancer metaphors are quite intriguing, but my take is environmental, possibly pollution and global warming. The French girl (beret) could be a nod to the Disneyland Paris castle.

I'm taking it that &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; is a phonetic substitute for &amp;quot;c,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;meaning &amp;quot;cancer.&amp;quot;  For better or worse, this kind of phoenetic clue was used in the Batman movie:&lt;br /&gt;

Well, I don't know if the intention here is that the &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; is making the &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; grow.  My point is that the dialogue is so nonsensical at points that it seems to be code.  I'm taking every noun as a metaphor for something.  &amp;quot;Sea&amp;quot; being &amp;quot;cancer&amp;quot; seems to fit (&amp;quot;The cancer can't make more of itself forever, can it?&amp;quot;)  I guess go back through the dialogue and see what other words could substitute for what they're saying.  Like I said, I don't know what &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;rain&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ground&amp;quot; could be in this metaphor.

I think this is the last day.

I agree - the water has started eroding the castle to the right, and it makes sense for the erosion to potentially loop the comic back to frame 1. That said, the title text was &amp;quot;wait for it&amp;quot;. This could be a euphamism suggesting &amp;quot;keep waiting, this comic changes&amp;quot;, but it does have an implication that there is a &amp;quot;finale&amp;quot; to the comic that you should wait for.

The most recent event is Megan walking in, saying &amp;quot;bye!&amp;quot; in *lower case*, and leaving.  From the lower case, which is different from the rest of the comic, I infer that she was talking to *us*, not (eg) herself or the sandcastle!  I reckon it's just going to fill up with water until the page is a static black rectangle. Especially since she and Cueball just talked about going off and exploring, grabbed their bags, and left. -cosmogoblin [[Special:Contributions/94.197.127.235|94.197.127.235]] 13:57, 26 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

: I suspect the small text was to show a &amp;quot;small voice&amp;quot; - talking quietly and sadly perhaps?

:: I agree with the small voice. The sea level is still rising, and interestingly, the sand barrier on the far right is eroding on *both sides* -- not just the seaward side, as previously.

::: The &amp;quot;both-sides&amp;quot; erosion is normal and realistic.

969 (+848) ''is'' completely blank on my LCD. &amp;lt;strike&amp;gt;I also cannot see Beret Girl in (967 or) 968 corresponding to +847 that [[User:75.84.65.238]]'s [http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php?title=1190:_Time&amp;amp;diff=35521&amp;amp;oldid=35485 edit] suggests.&amp;lt;/strike&amp;gt; I can see Beret Girl using [[Special:Contributions/192.54.204.33|192.54.204.33]]'s Paint with Black and White trick.

: Try viewing the comic from an extreme angle. I was able to see the Beret girl in 967+968 by tilting my screen forward on my laptop. You can't really see it otherwise.

:: Wait, I got those numbers mixed up, I think. 968 and 969 have Beret Girl in it, you just need to view at an extreme angle to see it. 970 (+849) looks blank to me, but there's still something there. The scene uses RGB 254,254,254, which is why it doesn't appear at all on my screen.  You can reveal it using the diff or a smart selection tool in Photoshop or the like.

I don't see this as a comic in a comic -- I see it more as act 2 (after the fadeout of act 1, with the stage crew jumping the gun and being caught on camera heading on stage to change the set).  Theoretically, this second act can be as long as the first one -- The Quest for the Source of the River/Sea.

Just wanted to say: I don't think the beret girl is a girl at all. It's a boy with an old-fashioned navy-style cap. Popular with boys at the beach (in the old days). See images here (http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x130/JTMarcus/h1.jpg) and here (http://cabinetcardgallery.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/kidwithcap_0003.jpg) I also like the fact that, just before the castle completely fades away, you can barely see the little boy bringing more materials (maybe another support beam?) to continue the work.&lt;br /&gt;
I like the continuity of letting the beret boy (not girl)&lt;br /&gt;
: Wether it's a navy cap or not may be open to interpretation (though I'd still bet it's a beret - it surely looks a lot more like the one the beret guy wears, and I think Randall would have put a little more effort into that detail if he wanted it to pass off as a navy cap). As for it being a boy, no. It's definitely a girl, you can clearly see it has a longer hair, and come to think of it, Randall rarely draws any hair at all for male characters anyway. --[[Special:Contributions/201.53.213.201|201.53.213.201]] 23:36, 29 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

I am hoping that this &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; somehow connects to the [http://xkcd.com/1110/ &amp;quot;Click and Drag&amp;quot;] comic i.e. when the camera zoom out far enough, we'll see that they are actually in the &amp;quot;Click and Drag&amp;quot; world. --[[Special:Contributions/98.14.191.109|98.14.191.109]] 23:59, 29 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Odd, it looks like +861, +862, and +863 are out of order, judging by the ground not changing at all and the characters not walking continuously. I wonder if that was an accidental mistake in XKCD server's delivery of the images or if there's an actual meaning to it.

During the last glacial period the sea level was more than 100 meters lower than it is nowadays, so coastal structures looked very different and the continents exposed much more land. I believe the first act of this comic references medieval ages in Europe where people would witness (over the scope of hundreds of years or longer) losing land and coastal towns to the sea but not understanding the process, as Megan states. I'm expecting the second act, and possibly further acts, to reference the abundance of scientifical discoveries made during the last few centuries.

Well, they've made it back to the beach.  I think it will end either at 1000 or 1024, and the only reason it might go to 1024 is allow some dialog and zooming in. :-)  --[[User:Divad27182|Divad27182]] ([[User talk:Divad27182|talk]]) 18:01, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I thought that too initially - the terrain features certainly seems identical (to scale) to the one at the start of the story. But something's bothering me; it's about the frame before we see they are back on a beach - they are already seated, so it's fair to assume they haven't moved, yet the terrain is different. By looking at the terrain, you could guess that maybe the terrain is inverted, which would then indicate that the frame with the beach in view is from a different angle than the previous frame. But for that to be the case, Cueball would have to be behind Megan on the previous frame, yet, their positions are unchanged on these frames. So, I don't know... I'll stop rambling now, and just wait and see, I guess... --[[User:Fernandofig|Fernandofig]] ([[User talk:Fernandofig|talk]]) 18:27, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Wait, what? It looks like they are suddenly back at a beach that looks the same as the first one, just zoomed out. But before when the scene was presumably inverted, the terrain didn't look quite like that. If the scene really did get inverted, maybe they aren't actually on a beach right now, but the sea will eventually expand until it reaches them. Then again, we don't know if this is the same plane of space that the original beach was either. They were just walking to the right. The concept of space in this comic is confusing me right now. I wonder if this will make sense later. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.63.158|129.21.63.158]] 18:41, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

It appears that the camera perspective has changed. 1 - 970 are all perpendicular to the shoreline, with the water on the right, camera looking down the shore. 971-996 are shown parallel to the shore line, with the camera position apparently out over the water or standing at the shore, looking back toward land. (If the camera had maintained the original position, the characters would have simply gotten smaller as the walked away, but instead we got to see the walk across the frame while presumably following the shore.) In 997, the camera perspective just comes back around to be a profile shot again, looking down the shoreline, water once again on the right. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.183.156.9|65.183.156.9]] 19:40, 30 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Near the end of the transcript, it says that at +847 Beret Girl drops in again, dragging something. I used Photoshop to lower the brightness, and can see about half of her head facing away from the sandcastle. She's not dragging anything.

&amp;quot;How long can this go on?  I would say a very long time.  Currently, each day is filled mostly with a very few backgrounds used over several comics with only the characters moving -- not that difficult to produce -- and maybe a few lines of dialog, which also allows for the repetition of the background.

== Image updates ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is Randall playing with me? My script is collecting at 00,05,20,35,50 each hour but many times now I got this:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
969:00 41/09:00 f8a6414c334a71481e16428691fe8465098b2bae956e44727d0482c7632a84ff.png &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I still could get the correct update, but I have to check all downloads so far.--[[User:Dgbrt|Dgbrt]] ([[User talk:Dgbrt|talk]]) 18:41, 4 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm seeing that, too.  For myself, I'm going to filter them into a separate directory. [[User:Larry|Larry]] ([[User talk:Larry|talk]]) 22:45, 4 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm getting ...a84ff from http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time.png, but the main http://xkcd.com/1190/ gives the current image. [[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 23:43, 4 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
The 00:00 UTC (8 pm EDT) update worked. [[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 00:02, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Has anyone noticed that the exact same identical image was re-used several times recently? If you go to http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/ and tell it to show differences from frame 1090, and then start clicking forward, the following frames are all exactly the same: 1094, 1097, 1101, 1103, 1107. Looking at http://xkcd.aubronwood.com/# you can then see that 1111 and 1113 are also the same. The rapid perspective change makes the animation appear to strobe. Could this be some strange attempt to illustrate something like an earthquake, or are they just re-using frames to avoid having to draw so many?

&lt;br /&gt;
: As you may have read above, the server did deliver one image repeatedly, so some sites may show this image multiple times. --[[Special:Contributions/84.174.9.61|84.174.9.61]] 08:24, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

You can see it in the [http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/log.txt log for geekwagon], do an in page search (ctrl+f) for f8a6414c334a71481e16428691fe8465098b2bae956e44727d0482c7632a84ff. That image is collected multiple times and causes other images to be duplicated too because the script only checks to see if the current link is different than the previous.--[[User:Deplicator|Deplicator]] ([[User talk:Deplicator|talk]]) 13:15, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

I think what happened is that one of the three sites (107.6.97.102) started giving the same result each time.  Now, I think they are down for maintenance....  --[[User:Divad27182|Divad27182]] ([[User talk:Divad27182|talk]]) 20:47, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Hours ==&lt;br /&gt;
There seems to be a problem starting with today (Sunday, 2013-05-05): The first picture should be 984:00 and not 983:00. I'm not able to check if it's simply a bot (?) error writing down the hours or something more serious. --[[Special:Contributions/82.135.84.245|82.135.84.245]] 15:56, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hour 983 on image 1104 Saturday (23:00 UTC) also appears on image 1105 Sunday (00:00 UTC). The image numbers are correct, but the hour count appears to be off by 1 hour now.[[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 16:34, 5 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
== Not all images do map to the hash ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I did run this great command posted here before on 13 April 2013:&lt;br /&gt;
 md5sum -b * | sort | uniq -w32 -D&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then I did rename all duplicates to image???_.png. After that I did download the hashes from here to image???.png and run the check again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First result is easy. Files are changed so md5sum for image002_ and image002 are different but content is the same. But 004 is wrong and I will update this one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 878341ab1f710e5832aa7ed5cfa66ed7 *image002_.png&lt;br /&gt;
 878341ab1f710e5832aa7ed5cfa66ed7 *image004_.png&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I will check all carefully and post my updates at the bottom of this section.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next duplicate is also easy because files are still the same:&lt;br /&gt;
 129721094a74fe94c723160991a1e704 *image427_.png&lt;br /&gt;
 129721094a74fe94c723160991a1e704 *image429_.png&lt;br /&gt;

--[[User:Dgbrt|Dgbrt]] ([[User talk:Dgbrt|talk]]) 19:37, 6 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And new downloads from xkcd are still different on MD5 but this two files are also identical for a viewer:&lt;br /&gt;

--[[User:Dgbrt|Dgbrt]] ([[User talk:Dgbrt|talk]]) 19:41, 6 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 5de911984714c1ec7bf93149a5cca9b4 *image454.png&lt;br /&gt;
 5de911984714c1ec7bf93149a5cca9b4 *image455.png&lt;br /&gt;

== Split the movie? ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The page is becoming impossible to load.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would suggest to split the movie into pieces, for instance by making a separate sub-page for each week (avoiding embarassing discussion on the most natural cutting point). Each week can have a separate description, seven-seconds animation, list of 7x24 pictures etc, and a link to the following and previous weeks.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
:My only suggestion would be give it larger segments. I don't think it needs to be as small as a week - after all, it loaded fine for a very long time. Maybe approx. half a scene each? Scene 1 is 971 frames long, so how about split at 500, at 971, and again at 1500 (when it gets there)? [[Special:Contributions/24.129.75.17|24.129.75.17]] 08:12, 8 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

:This is not real life. And they know it's not real life. Maybe they are in some sort of Matrix and know about it, or they are playing a video game. They've seen in developers' blog that devs are working on a lot of new features for version 0.19, such as improved sand physics, multiple rivers, rain, salty water, trebuchets, swimming, surf, etc. But then developers decided to release part of these features in version 0.19, and leave the rest for 0.20. When Cueball an Megan saw that version 0.19 is out, they immediately decided to try it out, without even looking at the changelog. So they don't know which features made it into this version, and which ones will be in the next one. So far they have played around with new sand physics and trebuchets, tried swimming in the sea, tried to drink sea water, found a new river. They haven't seen any surf, so they think it'll be in 0.20. They have yet to try swimming in a river, or see the rain. They have also found a bug that causes sea level to raise indefinitely. They think it could be caused either by rain, additional rivers, or just by a griefer who built a giant sand generator array to fill in the sea and flood everything. Oh, and they can't just create a new private world to see if the sea raises there, because of the DRM.&lt;br /&gt;

Swimming in a river is dangerous if there's a strong current. Even slow moving water has a lot of power.

We know: &amp;quot;The sea is big&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The river is small&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But we also know about the sea: There are no waves. It's just rising. So it is not an ocean, it's just a lake. Many people say &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; to a lake when they can not see the other side.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And we know their home river is small. But right now they explore a different bigger river.&lt;br /&gt;

We know it's not summer so maybe it is spring and the river is rising like every year?&lt;br /&gt;

It seems like the two river halves (or two rivers) merge as Megan and Cueball hike upstream. New point: I joined all the images covering their journey since image 1150 (last stop for water). it spans 18204 pixels. Assuming Cueball is 6 feet tall (wild guess + it's an even number), they have now hiked a total of 0.517 miles (83228.7 cm) from image 1150.[[User:Galois|Galois]] ([[User talk:Galois|talk]]) 13:32, 10 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Considering the elaborate and fragile sand castles, the one- and two-person construction of the platform and its castle components, and maybe the latest antics at the top of the dunes, it appears that gravity is not Earth-normal.

Since this 1190 will never end, will it? I think we need some archive sites.&lt;br /&gt;

Next would be &amp;quot;1190 Time Images 2013-04 April&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

:::::::I wasn't shouting, there is no need to bring ad hominem into this discussion. There are a number of solutions available here; we could tabulate frames per month as per [[explain_xkcd:Community_portal/Proposals#Time:_The_Table|this neglected post]], offload prior months to other pages, or scrap old hashes to cut a large portion of the article's body text. Each solution will lead to degradation of the explanation, splitting the article will force multiple page loads while removing the hash values will be destroying part of the metadata around the comic. Ideally, we wouldn't have to make the split at all, but speed considerations mean that we eventually will have to do it. In that eventuality, all we can do is the thing that degrades the explanation for the average visitor the least. What do visitors care more about, faster load times/having all the frames on one page or having 1000-odd incomprehensible and meaningless hash values? We don't display the individual filenames for Click and Drag even though they were more informative than the hashes here, because they hold little value to visitors; they only take up space that could be used to further enhance the explanation. Pure archival without curation is what other websites do, not a wiki with the intended goal of making xkcd accessible.

== Prediction ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Does anyone else see the last frame (whenever it may be), have the ability to connect to the first, thus creating a cycle?

&lt;br /&gt;
My theory: Based on the frames don't change much; Randell is an expert at creating xkcd frames; he only needs 24 per day to keep going; and we have no idea how long he's been preparing for this. It could last forever.--[[User:Deplicator|Deplicator]] ([[User talk:Deplicator|talk]]) 19:42, 12 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

You realize that what we've seen so far is what the beginning of a comic that goes on forever looks like :-) Tom A. (&amp;quot;I don't want to be immortal through my art!

So Cueball and Megan seem to entering a region with much more vegetation. Up until now I had assumed that the previous regions had vegetation as well but Randall just hadn't bothered drawing it (such detail is rare in XKCD). So what does presence of vegetation mean? More rainfall? Higher elevation? Also how far have Cueball and Megan travelled? I don't think the frames are necessarily contiguous - if this was a movie we'd have background music to go with the images. They could have been travelling for days or weeks - I definitely don't think it is still the same day as the start of Act II. I suppose 'time' will tell. [[User:Joncaves|Joncaves]] ([[User talk:Joncaves|talk]]) 17:13, 14 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The yawn suggests that they haven't slept yet, so quite possibly the same day.  Also interesting that they seem to treat first the small bush and now the tree as worthy of notice -- were there no trees where they lived?

&lt;br /&gt;
The current frame (1355) looks remarkably similar to the area at left hand edge of XKCD 1110 (Click and Drag), which also features the same two characters discussing how they've walked &amp;quot;pretty far&amp;quot;. I wonder how much of a coincidence this is. [[Special:Contributions/82.69.211.1|82.69.211.1]] 11:46, 15 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Hmm, and despite the overall journey feeling epic, didn't someone calculate the distance travelled (calculated via Cueball units) to be only a mile or two? [[Special:Contributions/99.123.5.106|99.123.5.106]] 01:48, 16 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Does anyone has an explanation for the change from frame 1360 to 1361? --[[User:FG|FG]] ([[User talk:FG|talk]]) 10:41, 16 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I thought the transition from 1359 -&amp;gt; 1360 was even more 'abrupt' than the transition from 1360 - &amp;gt; 1361 (in fact my first thought was that 1360 was out-of-order or some other 'mistake'). But from subsequent frames it has become clear that Cueball wandered off and explored the area on his own while Megan was sleeping. [[User:Joncaves|Joncaves]] ([[User talk:Joncaves|talk]]) 15:56, 16 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
::I think [1359:1362] looks similar to [1097:1120]. Probably Cueball was just walking perpendicularly to the image. --[[User:DiEvAl|DiEvAl]] ([[User talk:DiEvAl|talk]]) 21:13, 16 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here's another example of the slightly 'strange' way of talking: &amp;quot;I'm surprised we haven't been seen by any people yet&amp;quot;. Wouldn't most people say: &amp;quot;I'm surprised we haven't seen any people yet&amp;quot;? So who are 'people'? Are 'people' somehow invisible to both Cueball and Megan? Are 'people' a threat? Have 'people' also moved on because of the rising sea level? [[User:Joncaves|Joncaves]] ([[User talk:Joncaves|talk]]) 19:25, 17 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The latest frame (1506) has two trees. They are almost certainly baobab trees. There are 8 species of baobab tree, but of those 8, 6 are endemic to the island of Madagascar, including the species which the trees in the comic most resemble, the Grandidier baobab. Even if they are not one of the six species endemic to Madagascar, the fact that they are baobabs still limits them to the continent of Africa, the countries of Oman and Yemen, and northwestern Australia. This means that the big sea, if it is an ocean, is most likely the Indian Ocean. [[Special:Contributions/76.92.118.150|76.92.118.150]] 18:30, 21 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Conversation is in &amp;quot;Simple English&amp;quot;. I am not native English but I think we should mention this. Am I wrong?--[[User:Dgbrt|Dgbrt]] ([[User talk:Dgbrt|talk]]) 20:57, 17 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

::&amp;quot;Simple English&amp;quot; isn't a special dialect or anything, but the conversation definitely has a simple, almost naive, style.  Lots of single-syllable vocabulary without much Latin-derived flowery or &amp;quot;sophisticated&amp;quot; words.  I counted 27 three-syllable words and one four-syllable word in the entire dialog, scenes 1 and 2 combined.  They don't seem to have a name for &amp;quot;sand dunes.&amp;quot;  They talked about a river being &amp;quot;broken.&amp;quot;  They are very playful, mature but child-like.  It gives the story a kind of alien feel.  [[User:Taibhse|Taibhse]] ([[User talk:Taibhse|talk]]) 17:27, 18 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
==Explanation==&lt;br /&gt;
{{w|Flowchart|Flowcharts}} are diagrams that represent processes in a graphical form. While predominantly used in {{w|computer programming}} to visualise the structure of source code, flowcharts can in theory be used to depict any real or virtual procedure. In this comic, this idea is subverted by employing a flowchart to explain flowcharts itself. As for reading the flowchart prior knowledge on how to read a flowchart is required, the comic induces a {{w|deadlock|deadlocked}} situation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Moreover, the functionality of flowcharts is quite intuitive, thus rendering the attempted self-description in the comic obsolete. In fact, due to the self-explanatory nature of flowcharts, the one provided in the comic does not even explain the manner of functioning: It only confirms their capability to those who already know how to use it. Someone who contradicts himself by claiming he does not see the arrows albeit following them is left with the message &amp;quot;I hate you&amp;quot; in End-Box 2b. For everyone else, the chart inevitably leads to the &amp;quot;Let's go drink&amp;quot; box, which gives rise to the assumption that the whole chart was only a pretence for drinking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{{w|FreeBSD}} is a {{w|unixoid}} operating system for computers which is generally considered to require advanced skills. The question whether {{w|Linux}} or (Free)BSD is the preferable operating system is a question of belief to some. The comic takes sides against FreeBSD by implying that one would only install it in a state of insobriety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The title text mentions {{w|Microsoft Bob}}, a software package published in 1995 by {{w|Microsoft}}. The product was targeted towards beginners and therefore provides the user with a cartoon-style interface instead of a productive environment. While being a commercial failure, the system serves as an insider joke between IT professionals until the present day.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
==Explanation==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Wikipedia:Flowchart|Flowcharts]] are diagrams used to show the logical flow of an algorithm or program. In this comic, Randall uses the fact that flowcharts can indeed be used to show a loop in the procedure: in this case, the reader will theoretically become trapped in a loop of reading the text in the diamond, following the line marked &amp;quot;YES,&amp;quot; and ending back up in the diamond. Those familiar with flowcharts will notice though that, while diamonds usually contain decision questions (which can be answered multiple ways), the diamond here actually includes a statement instead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The title text suggests that the only way to escape the loop is to add to the flowchart: between &amp;quot;START&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;HEY, WAIT, THIS FLOWCHART IS A TRAP!&amp;quot;, place a rectangle containing &amp;quot;GET A MARKER,&amp;quot; and then add another line marked &amp;quot;NO&amp;quot; proceeding from the diamond to a rounded box labeled &amp;quot;END.&amp;quot; Of course, this changes the algorithm completely, but it releases the reader from the infinite loop by creating a paradox.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Randall has made use of [[627: Tech Support Cheat Sheet|flowcharts]] before.&lt;br /&gt;

The picture does chance with time. The URL includes a changing timestamp that I can't decipher. Compare these two URLS (which have slightly different images:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps there is a way to hack the URL to view future images. [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:29, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I would also like to add that knowing randall, these are not the only images. For all we know, the image will still be changing in 5 years while a tree grows in front of them. My point is: Are the URLs hackable, or did he encrypt them? [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:33, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Likely there is a way to hack the URLs; they look like some sort of hash, probably a hashed timestamp. Of course, he could easily have added some salt to the hash, making it significantly *harder* to hack. But they're strings of a specific length, so it should be pretty easy to bruteforce it, fetch all the images, and then (maybe) reverse-engineer the sequence. *That* all depends on how many of them there are.

It seems that the image is updated every 1/2 hour. [[Special:Contributions/152.23.97.150|152.23.97.150]] 06:17, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: Given that the images switch back and forth between other images already seen, and that the comic should be viewable in the future, it seems unlikely that it's any thing like a simple sha256 of part of the timestamp.  I think it's more likely a function of half-hours and minutes (assuming we continue to get a new possible image every half-hour).

::: The images do cycle, yes. But for some reason I have never seen the img where Megan is looking behind her. Also wouldn't it be difficult to show a sequential story (like the rising tide) if the previous images keep cycling ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hash appears to be SHA-256. I tried some obvious hashes (&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;11901&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190_1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190.1&amp;quot;) to no avail. Maybe this is HMAC-SHA256? Also, I would suggest trying Unix timestamps. [[Special:Contributions/131.156.236.149|131.156.236.149]] 06:19, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

Alright, this is probably not going to work, but I'm trying to exploit Randall's awesomeness here. Maybe he decided to take the time-stamps from the user? I don't know if that's even possible... That would then allow people in different time zones to obtain different images simultaneously. (What's the corollary of Godwin's law for a bunch of math-and-science nerds and relativity? Is there one?) Clicking the img src url on the comic's html page, give me this: http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/752687b61523144c61736cd89f8c153dc41e19128f72d78d44947ff800f057fa.png : Never mind.. apparently others see the same image too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

I'm no programmer but this looks important to me...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:Doesn't really help. The script basically changes the image when something happens (probably some time passes, although it's possible there is more hidden there). WHAT image then appears is not directed by the script, but by the site. Specifically, the image displayed as first is taken from [http://c0.xkcd.com/redirect/comic/time http://c0.xkcd.com/redirect/comic/time], while the script asks for [http://c0.xkcd.com/stream/comic/time?method=EventSource&amp;amp;r=(somenumber) http://c0.xkcd.com/stream/comic/time?method=EventSource&amp;amp;r=(somenumber)] ... which is, if you get correct &amp;quot;r&amp;quot;, probably some json containing the image url. So, even if you hack the script, you will not get all possible urls. -- [[User:Hkmaly|Hkmaly]] ([[User talk:Hkmaly|talk]]) 09:17, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:: ... actually, given that the script part doesn't seem to do anything just now, it's even possible it's for later (ie, starts producing images when the correct time come). Or maybe there is a bug somewhere in the code :-). -- [[User:Hkmaly|Hkmaly]] ([[User talk:Hkmaly|talk]]) 09:27, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:::Thanks for explaining. Why hasn't anyone posted this before? Could &amp;quot;location.hash&amp;quot; possibly have anything to do with the method used to generate the image hash key? Also, why is this code so difficult to follow (Obfuscation?)? So many questions... Sorry if this is just a huge waste of ''Time''.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:::: &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;location&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is the URI of the page. &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;location.hash&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is the part of the uri after the ''#'' character. If you go to [https://xkcd.com/1190/#verbose https://xkcd.com/1190/#verbose], you'll see some debugging output in your browser's debugging console (Firefox: Web Console or Firebug, Chrome: Development Tools). But nothing to decode the algorithm... :-( --[[Special:Contributions/83.243.48.2|83.243.48.2]] 10:01, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

The picture does chance with time. The URL includes a changing timestamp that I can't decipher. Compare these two URLS (which have slightly different images:&lt;br /&gt;
http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/8eb156cce408df8bb83528382d6a2aa2ce6c74f3c573fd12b058cd1c56420672.png&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps there is a way to hack the URL to view future images. [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:29, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I would also like to add that knowing randall, these are not the only images. For all we know, the image will still be changing in 5 years while a tree grows in front of them. My point is: Are the URLs hackable, or did he encrypt them? [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:33, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Likely there is a way to hack the URLs; they look like some sort of hash, probably a hashed timestamp. Of course, he could easily have added some salt to the hash, making it significantly *harder* to hack. But they're strings of a specific length, so it should be pretty easy to bruteforce it, fetch all the images, and then (maybe) reverse-engineer the sequence. *That* all depends on how many of them there are. [[Special:Contributions/76.90.249.178|76.90.249.178]] 05:44, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

It seems that the image is updated every 1/2 hour. [[Special:Contributions/152.23.97.150|152.23.97.150]] 06:17, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: Given that the images switch back and forth between other images already seen, and that the comic should be viewable in the future, it seems unlikely that it's any thing like a simple sha256 of part of the timestamp.  I think it's more likely a function of half-hours and minutes (assuming we continue to get a new possible image every half-hour). [[Special:Contributions/99.153.248.206|99.153.248.206]] 06:59, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
::: The images do cycle, yes. But for some reason I have never seen the img where Megan is looking behind her. Also wouldn't it be difficult to show a sequential story (like the rising tide) if the previous images keep cycling ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hash appears to be SHA-256. I tried some obvious hashes (&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;11901&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190_1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190.1&amp;quot;) to no avail. Maybe this is HMAC-SHA256? Also, I would suggest trying Unix timestamps. [[Special:Contributions/131.156.236.149|131.156.236.149]] 06:19, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I've been trying to make educated guesses as to what's being hashed here: http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator ... he could also be using hash(hash2(value)) which would be virtually impossible to crack. [[Special:Contributions/99.153.248.206|99.153.248.206]] 06:59, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's entirely possible that the &amp;quot;hash&amp;quot; is actually randomly generated. Just a thought. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.119.153|129.21.119.153]] 07:03, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alright, this is probably not going to work, but I'm trying to exploit Randall's awesomeness here. Maybe he decided to take the time-stamps from the user? I don't know if that's even possible... That would then allow people in different time zones to obtain different images simultaneously. (What's the corollary of Godwin's law for a bunch of math-and-science nerds and relativity? Is there one?) Clicking the img src url on the comic's html page, give me this: http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/752687b61523144c61736cd89f8c153dc41e19128f72d78d44947ff800f057fa.png : Never mind.. apparently others see the same image too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Could he be doing this live? Monitoring the discussion on the net? Collaborative, crowdsourced comic-ing? Reminds me of those you-decide-what-the-character-does-next-and-flip-to-appropriate-page parallel plot novels.&lt;br /&gt;

It just went back to the second image... [[Special:Contributions/220.224.246.97|220.224.246.97]] 07:59, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: And now changed to something new.  http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/cdcc6b46b32c53f8596cd0106958b42c4260b9cbc022e6d94054147aa6554960.png&lt;br /&gt;

I'm no programmer but this looks important to me...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:Doesn't really help. The script basically changes the image when something happens (probably some time passes, although it's possible there is more hidden there). WHAT image then appears is not directed by the script, but by the site. Specifically, the image displayed as first is taken from [http://c0.xkcd.com/redirect/comic/time http://c0.xkcd.com/redirect/comic/time], while the script asks for [http://c0.xkcd.com/stream/comic/time?method=EventSource&amp;amp;r=(somenumber) http://c0.xkcd.com/stream/comic/time?method=EventSource&amp;amp;r=(somenumber)] ... which is, if you get correct &amp;quot;r&amp;quot;, probably some json containing the image url. So, even if you hack the script, you will not get all possible urls. -- [[User:Hkmaly|Hkmaly]] ([[User talk:Hkmaly|talk]]) 09:17, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:: ... actually, given that the script part doesn't seem to do anything just now, it's even possible it's for later (ie, starts producing images when the correct time come). Or maybe there is a bug somewhere in the code :-). -- [[User:Hkmaly|Hkmaly]] ([[User talk:Hkmaly|talk]]) 09:27, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

:::Thanks for explaining. Why hasn't anyone posted this before? Could &amp;quot;location.hash&amp;quot; possibly have anything to do with the method used to generate the image hash key? Also, why is this code so difficult to follow (Obfuscation?)? So many questions... Sorry if this is just a huge waste of ''Time''.&lt;br /&gt;

The picture does chance with time. The URL includes a changing timestamp that I can't decipher. Compare these two URLS (which have slightly different images:&lt;br /&gt;
http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/8eb156cce408df8bb83528382d6a2aa2ce6c74f3c573fd12b058cd1c56420672.png&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps there is a way to hack the URL to view future images. [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:29, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I would also like to add that knowing randall, these are not the only images. For all we know, the image will still be changing in 5 years while a tree grows in front of them. My point is: Are the URLs hackable, or did he encrypt them? [[Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121|199.30.248.121]] 05:33, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Likely there is a way to hack the URLs; they look like some sort of hash, probably a hashed timestamp. Of course, he could easily have added some salt to the hash, making it significantly *harder* to hack. But they're strings of a specific length, so it should be pretty easy to bruteforce it, fetch all the images, and then (maybe) reverse-engineer the sequence. *That* all depends on how many of them there are. [[Special:Contributions/76.90.249.178|76.90.249.178]] 05:44, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

It seems that the image is updated every 1/2 hour. [[Special:Contributions/152.23.97.150|152.23.97.150]] 06:17, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: Given that the images switch back and forth between other images already seen, and that the comic should be viewable in the future, it seems unlikely that it's any thing like a simple sha256 of part of the timestamp.  I think it's more likely a function of half-hours and minutes (assuming we continue to get a new possible image every half-hour). [[Special:Contributions/99.153.248.206|99.153.248.206]] 06:59, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
::: The images do cycle, yes. But for some reason I have never seen the img where Megan is looking behind her. Also wouldn't it be difficult to show a sequential story (like the rising tide) if the previous images keep cycling ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hash appears to be SHA-256. I tried some obvious hashes (&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;11901&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190_1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1190.1&amp;quot;) to no avail. Maybe this is HMAC-SHA256? Also, I would suggest trying Unix timestamps. [[Special:Contributions/131.156.236.149|131.156.236.149]] 06:19, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
: I've been trying to make educated guesses as to what's being hashed here: http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator ... he could also be using hash(hash2(value)) which would be virtually impossible to crack. [[Special:Contributions/99.153.248.206|99.153.248.206]] 06:59, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's entirely possible that the &amp;quot;hash&amp;quot; is actually randomly generated. Just a thought. [[Special:Contributions/129.21.119.153|129.21.119.153]] 07:03, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alright, this is probably not going to work, but I'm trying to exploit Randall's awesomeness here. Maybe he decided to take the time-stamps from the user? I don't know if that's even possible... That would then allow people in different time zones to obtain different images simultaneously. (What's the corollary of Godwin's law for a bunch of math-and-science nerds and relativity? Is there one?) Clicking the img src url on the comic's html page, give me this: http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/752687b61523144c61736cd89f8c153dc41e19128f72d78d44947ff800f057fa.png : Never mind.. apparently others see the same image too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Could he be doing this live? Monitoring the discussion on the net? Collaborative, crowdsourced comic-ing? Reminds me of those you-decide-what-the-character-does-next-and-flip-to-appropriate-page parallel plot novels.&lt;br /&gt;

I'm no programmer but this looks important to me...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:Doesn't really help. The script basically changes the image when something happens (probably some time passes, although it's possible there is more hidden there). WHAT image then appears is not directed by the script, but by the site. Specifically, the image displayed as first is taken from [http://c0.xkcd.com/redirect/comic/time http://c0.xkcd.com/redirect/comic/time], while the script asks for [http://c0.xkcd.com/stream/comic/time?method=EventSource&amp;amp;r=(somenumber) http://c0.xkcd.com/stream/comic/time?method=EventSource&amp;amp;r=(somenumber)] ... which is, if you get correct &amp;quot;r&amp;quot;, probably some json containing the image url. So, even if you hack the script, you will not get all possible urls. -- [[User:Hkmaly|Hkmaly]] ([[User talk:Hkmaly|talk]]) 09:17, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:: ... actually, given that the script part doesn't seem to do anything just now, it's even possible it's for later (ie, starts producing images when the correct time come). Or maybe there is a bug somewhere in the code :-). -- [[User:Hkmaly|Hkmaly]] ([[User talk:Hkmaly|talk]]) 09:27, 25 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

:::Thanks for explaining. Why hasn't anyone posted this before? Could &amp;quot;location.hash&amp;quot; possibly have anything to do with the method used to generate the image hash key? Also, why is this code so difficult to follow (Obfuscation?)? So many questions... Sorry if this is just a huge waste of ''Time''.&lt;br /&gt;

==Explanation==&lt;br /&gt;
Many people who use Linux start out not really knowing anything about it, other than that it's free. So, they find someone who knows about it to help them set it up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
XORG (officially X.Org) is an implementation of the X window manager, a program used on Linux. It often has configuration problems, and can be difficult and/or painful to fix (see [[963: X11]]).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Linux has many versions, called &amp;quot;distributions&amp;quot;. Each distribution, or &amp;quot;distro&amp;quot;, has a different look and feel, and different features. Ubuntu is a &amp;quot;beginner&amp;quot; version of Linux, designed to just &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; and be friendly toward people used to Windows. Debian is a somewhat more advanced distro that requires more knowledge of Linux (and sometimes programming), and gentoo is a very advanced version. Because she is fed up with Ubuntu trading functionality for ease-of-use, she switches to Gentoo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some advanced users of Linux decide to compile their kernel from source. This basically means that instead of downloading Linux and installing it, they download the source code, change somethings, build the source code into a runnable version of the OS, and then use it. To many advanced users, their installation of Linux is like a house might be to a homeowner: A never-ending project, improved slightly every day, but modified more often than it's actually used. In the final panel, she has become addicted to Linux, and as a heroin addict might take another dose, or a homeowner might paint something or move a picture, she might change a setting or two and recompile the kernel (OS).&lt;br /&gt;

}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Explanation==&lt;br /&gt;
The comic is a play on regenerative energies and the way they transform the natural resources (wind, sun, water) into electricity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The alt text is a reference to the very bad efficiency of solar panels (roughly 20-25%) and light bulbs (20-30%). Thus instead of only 80% loss of energy, which is either not converted to electricity or converted into heat) it's actually far more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thus the undoing done by the character is quite less effective than the common &amp;quot;Undo&amp;quot; function known from computers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Transcript==&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;!-- The transcript can be found in a hidden &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; element on the xkcd comic's html source, with id &amp;quot;transcript&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
  -- Tip: Use colons (:) in the beginning of lines to preserve the original line breaks. &lt;br /&gt;
  -- Any actions or descriptive lines in [[double brackets]] should be reduced to [single brackets] to avoid wikilinking&lt;br /&gt;
  -- Do not include the title text again here --&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I created this page.  --''[[User:Philosopher|Philosopher]]''&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;[[User talk:Philosopher|Let us reason together.]]&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 08:40, 1 August 2012 (EDT)&lt;br /&gt;

I've also created [[Explain XKCD:Sandbox]]. --''[[User:Philosopher|Philosopher]]''&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;[[User talk:Philosopher|Let us reason together.]]&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 08:40, 1 August 2012 (EDT)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I've changed [[MediaWiki:Helppage]] to point here.  If we decide to have a local users manual or help desk, it should probably be changed.  The default target was &amp;quot;Help:Contents&amp;quot;.

== Comments ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hey,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You might consider [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Comments Extension:Comments]. It acts basically like the comment system on the blog, so you could keep everything (article, comments) in one place. It's more conducive to casual conversation than the discussion page.&lt;br /&gt;
--[[User:Cyanfish|Cyanfish]] ([[User talk:Cyanfish|talk]]) 14:07, 2 August 2012 (EDT)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:That's nice, but a simpler approach could be just to transclude the talk page in the subject page itself, as is done in the Wikipedia Signpost (see [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2012-07-30/Technology report|here]] for an example). --[[User:Waldir|Waldir]] ([[User talk:Waldir|talk]]) 16:15, 3 August 2012 (EDT)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
::Okay, that would work. The extension does have its advantages though - it's easier for new users (no markup), you can have upvotes/downvotes/&amp;quot;comments of the day&amp;quot;... It's a matter of preference, I suppose. --[[User:Cyanfish|Cyanfish]] ([[User talk:Cyanfish|talk]]) 22:27, 3 August 2012 (EDT)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
::: I'll take a look and see what looks best.  I don't necessarily like the transcluding option. --[[User:Jeff|Jeff]] ([[User talk:Jeff|talk]]) 15:56, 6 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
::::Neither do I, to be honest. I just created {{tl|Comic discussion}} to make things a little smoother, but from my experience, there will *always* be newcomers forgetting to sign, commenters confused about the best markup for indentation/replies, comments placed at the top rather than at the bottom, new comic description pages created without that template, etc. A proper commenting solution might be the best option for this. I just mentioned the transclusion option to let people know it was a possibility. Also, in the long run we need to make sure the wiki doesn't start looking like Wikia (blergh) if we start adding too many custom extensions. But a comment extension seems to be essential if we don't want to alienate the blog's community. --[[User:Waldir|Waldir]] ([[User talk:Waldir|talk]]) 17:06, 6 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;small&amp;gt;Following post moved from [[Explain XKCD:Community portal/Proposals#Comments]] --[[User:Waldir|Waldir]] ([[User talk:Waldir|talk]]) 17:11, 6 August 2012 (UTC)&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'd like to suggest we add comments capabilities to the comics pages, since the discussion pages don't lend themselves to the kind of dialogue experienced on the blog. There appear to be several extensions that allow this, but I'm fairly new to the wikimedia stuff so I'm not sure how it would work, exactly. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One extension available is [[mw:Extension:WordPress Comments|Extension:WordPress Comments]], which appears to enable the style of comments we are used to. Any thoughts? --[[User:DanB|DanB]] (talk) 15:10, 6 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

:: That said, [http://shadowfax.org.uk/wiki/MediaWiki_Wordpress_Comment_Extension_Code its demo] looks rather simple. Extension:Comments seems to be a little more powerful (supporting replies, user pictures, voting, and maybe more). The only advantage of the Wordpress one is that it would integrate with Wordpress so extra accounts don't need to be created, but I assume most people who used to comment on the blog didn't have accounts anyway... --[[User:Waldir|Waldir]] ([[User talk:Waldir|talk]]) 19:58, 7 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
::: Tried [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Comments Extension:Comments] - but the download page for it does not exist.  Anyone have any ideas why that is?

I'm not sure how to set it up, but if you could edit the robots.txt file to exclude the contents of [[:Category:Noindexed pages]]?

:Apparently you can edit it through [[MediaWiki:Robots.txt]], but I'm not experienced enough to know what will happen if you block a url that runs through a .php page.  (Perhaps nothing?  Perhaps it blocks everything?)  Is there any chance of moving the wiki to use /wiki/articlename urls like Wikipedia does rather than the current /wiki/index.php?title=articlename ?  --''[[User:Philosopher|Philosopher]]''&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;[[User talk:Philosopher|Let us reason together.]]&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 10:43, 1 August 2012 (EDT)&lt;br /&gt;

I had already brought the [[MediaWiki:Gadget-HotCat.js|HotCat gadget]], which should now be visible in the users' preferences for enabling. It was also necessary to create [[MediaWiki:Gadgets-definition]] and [[MediaWiki:Gadget-HotCat|the description for HotCat]] so it could appear in the preferences page. However, it doesn't seem to be working... If someone can figure out what's wrong, we can fix it. One can test the script separately from the gadget system (so we can make sure it's not a gadget problem) by installing it as a user script, as I did in [[User:Waldir/common.js]] --[[User:Waldir|Waldir]] ([[User talk:Waldir|talk]]) 11:02, 7 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
:[[User:SlashMe|SlashMe]] said ([[explain xkcd:Community portal/Proposals#Adding a new comic|here]]): ''When we agree on a page layout, I can do this automatically.'' He's speaking about importing and creating pages for all comics programmatically. I don't know if he includes the explanations from your blog posts, though...&lt;br /&gt;
:Also, do you think it could be a good idea to import, in the comic discussions here, the comments existing in the wordpress blog for comics prior to the wiki conversion? They obviously wouldn't be associated with wiki accounts, but we could get a copy of them here (with the dates, names, and also the +/- comment appreciation maybe...). Perhaps this could be considered once the idea of wordpress comments on wiki pages (as suggested [[Explain XKCD:Community portal/Technical#Comments|here]] by [[User:DanB|DanB]]) is already settled.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
:: I don't think I can import blog posts completely automatically, but maybe write something to make it easier. I'll have to look what is possible, but I'd say the least I'll need is an account for Wordpress.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
::: Importing all previous blog comments would be awesome. We could try a test installation of wordpress and a few test pages here on the wiki (it's easy to delete them if we screw up anything). In any case, I expect some manual tweaking to be needed if we want to convert the comments already posted on-wiki into comments of the wordpress plugin. It's definitely a challenge, but after all, we're xkcd readers, by definition we enjoy a good puzzle :) (and many of us are perfectionists who won't settle for a less-than-perfect solution :D). I say let's hack the heck outta that extension! --[[User:Waldir|Waldir]] ([[User talk:Waldir|talk]]) 19:48, 7 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:: Sorry to the perfectionists, but regarding a less-than-perfect solution, could we include a link to the blog comments as a temporary stopgap? I've been using [[1004:_Batman]] to try my hand at adding a comic, and I added a subtle link to the blog comments below the discussion box/transmutation. I'm thinking that link could be added programatically because we know how the blog structure is with year/month/date foldering. --[[User:DanB|DanB]] ([[User talk:DanB|talk]]) 17:11, 8 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

This wiki lacks automation, every time a comic comes out it needs to be submitted manually. A really simple way to do this is utilize xkcd's own JSON feed.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
 Internal Server Error&lt;br /&gt;
 The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to &lt;br /&gt;
 complete your request.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 Please contact the server administrator, webadmin@kundenserver.de and inform &lt;br /&gt;
 them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that &lt;br /&gt;
 may have caused the error.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 More information about this error may be available in the server error log.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an &lt;br /&gt;
 ErrorDocument to handle the request.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Very strange, and not able to repro it, so it seems to have been transient.  Just noting it here in case it happens again.  I assume this is a hosting company hiccup.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Can we install the &amp;quot;references&amp;quot; plugin so that we can use &amp;quot;ref&amp;quot; tags and add &amp;quot;references&amp;quot; sections to certain comics? I grant that it won't be as useful as on wikipedia, as most references are generally just wikilinks to wikipedia anyway, but I think it could be helpful. In editing the [[Black Hat]] article, I wanted to cite references to specific comics. I had to write them into the text because references aren't installed. If References do get installed, I'd like to also suggest a template for {{tl|cite comic}} to create a quick and easy uniform reference to comics by number (or perhaps by name at the user's option?)

== Mainpage category issues ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Waldir already did some repairs to the {{tl|comic}} template to keep it from sorting the [[Main Page]] into categories when the template is transcluded on the main page, but I see that other manual categorizations are still being transcluded (eg: the main page is currently categorized into [[:category:Comics featuring Cueball]]. Is there a way to include the article without including its categories at all? [[User:TheHYPO|TheHYPO]] ([[User talk:TheHYPO|talk]]) 21:33, 8 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
:That doesn't seem to be related to the {{tl|comic}} template. Apparently the categories added manually to the comic page are getting to the main page. We can, for now, wrap them in noinclude tags. Maybe later we should create a {{tl|category}} template that does that automatically. --[[User:Waldir|Waldir]] ([[User talk:Waldir|talk]]) 23:40, 8 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
::I noted in that you'd already fixed the comic template. As I said, these were the &amp;quot;other manual categorizations&amp;quot;.

== Caching issues ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I seem to be seeing some caching issues with images. I can't be sure if this will still be in effect by the time anyone reads this, but at the time of writing, [[:File:United Shapes.png]], for example, is still displaying as an older revision (even though it correctly states the filesize and resolution of the current version). Viewing the &amp;quot;full sized image&amp;quot; ([http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/fc/United_Shapes.png http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/fc/United_Shapes.png]) still displays that older revision, as well. However, if you add a question mark to the end of the full sized URL ([http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/fc/United_Shapes.png? http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/fc/United_Shapes.png?]), the image is correctly purged and displays the correct image (although only with that URL, not on the file page nor where the image is transcluded). In other words, there's a caching issue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I used to edit on some Wikia sites where they also had this issue, and it drove all the editors up the wall (particularly since it ended up affecting a good portion of images when updated, sometimes for as long as several hours). It was frankly quite frustrating when Wikia refused to do anything about that problem (part of the reason I don't edit there anymore). Is there any chance someone could look into this issue? I'm not sure what entirely causes it. {{User:Omega/sig}} 01:58, 9 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:Aaaaand the image is updated (so the above example won't work anymore). The images definitely seem to be updating, but it's rather slow: at least a few minutes... {{User:Omega/sig}} 02:00, 9 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
::I think it might have to do with the [[mw:Manual:Job queue#HTML cache invalidation|Job queue]]. If that's the case, such updates will gradually happen as edits are made to other pages (each edit takes a job from the queue and runs it). But I'm not entirely sure that's what's at play here. --[[User:Waldir|Waldir]] ([[User talk:Waldir|talk]]) 03:28, 9 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

===Related issue?===&lt;br /&gt;
Don't know if this is related, but I'm noticing that thumbnails are displaying as red X's on alot of images - especially where I've noticed that editors have corrected the image title to lowercase in an article. One example is [[file:t-shirts]] and [[T-shirts]] - the thumbnails for the image history on the image page itself are Xs for me, as is the actualy comic on its comic page, which was at a reduced size. This isn't the only comic doing this. [[Hitler]] is as well, for example. [[User:TheHYPO|TheHYPO]] ([[User talk:TheHYPO|talk]]) 14:01, 13 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== Creating new comics ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm a big fan of [[List of all comics]] which I think is a great page and resource. Problem is, at least for me, the &amp;quot;create&amp;quot; button isn't working like it should. It's not preloading the {{tl|create}} template as a starting template. If someone has time to take a look at that issue, I think it's a great idea. Is there any way that the preload could also somehow be passed the comic number, image name and comic name so the user doesn't have to reenter those? We should look into this.

:Ditto.  There are a few refinements that I think could be made, though.&lt;br /&gt;
:* It's huge, taking a lot of time to load (tables tend to do that, I suppose) so perhaps breaking it into groups, even if it's on the same page (that is, separate tables for each hundred or fraction thereof) Breaking each into sections would allow a TOC for rapid navigation, too.&lt;br /&gt;
:* While it might be innocuous, the (create) link isn't needed for anything that isn't redlinked, so maybe an #ifexist, for when the pages do get created, the create no longer appears.&lt;br /&gt;
:Just thotz.  Otherwise, it's a really useful page, both for visitors, and gnomes. -- [[User:IronyChef|IronyChef]] ([[User talk:IronyChef|talk]]) 01:58, 16 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
::The create link only appears on redlinked pages for me already. [[User:TheHYPO|TheHYPO]] ([[User talk:TheHYPO|talk]]) 15:45, 16 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== short URLs ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hi, you should try to enable short URLs, which remove the ugly index.php from every URL. It makes navigation more intuitive and &amp;quot;wiki-style&amp;quot;. It's actually quite easy to do: [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Short_URL]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(Oh, and by the way, would you add WikiEditor? It's so beautiful :) [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:WikiEditor])&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Scaled Images ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the larger comics are being scaled down to 800px wide. But MediaWiki apparently wants a discrete image rather than scaling what's been uploaded. Is there a plan to fix this? I hope I posted to the right section [[User:Lcarsos|lcarsos]] ([[User talk:Lcarsos|talk]]) 21:39, 16 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:Can you provide an article as an example, because I'm not sure what you mean here. What I ''have'' noticed lately, and maybe this is the same thing you're talking about is that ''any'' scaled image is not displaying and I'm not sure what the error is.&lt;br /&gt;

For Example:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
: The image links to [http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/thumb/4/46/Cueball.png/50px-Cueball.png], which gives a 404. Maybe this is related to [[#short URLs]]? --[[Special:Contributions/83.243.48.2|83.243.48.2]] 06:49, 17 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;/div&gt;</summary>
