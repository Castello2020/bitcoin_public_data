<dl><dd> I would also like to add that knowing randall, these are not the only images. For all we know, the image will still be changing in 5 years while a tree grows in front of them. My point is: Are the URLs hackable, or did he encrypt them? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121" title="Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121">199.30.248.121</a> 05:33, 25 March 2013 (UTC)

<p>Likely there is a way to hack the URLs; they look like some sort of hash, probably a hashed timestamp. Of course, he could easily have added some salt to the hash, making it significantly *harder* to hack. But they're strings of a specific length, so it should be pretty easy to bruteforce it, fetch all the images, and then (maybe) reverse-engineer the sequence. *That* all depends on how many of them there are. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/76.90.249.178" title="Special:Contributions/76.90.249.178">76.90.249.178</a> 05:44, 25 March 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd> Given that the images switch back and forth between other images already seen, and that the comic should be viewable in the future, it seems unlikely that it's any thing like a simple sha256 of part of the timestamp.  I think it's more likely a function of half-hours and minutes (assuming we continue to get a new possible image every half-hour). <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/99.153.248.206" title="Special:Contributions/99.153.248.206">99.153.248.206</a> 06:59, 25 March 2013 (UTC)

<p>Hash appears to be SHA-256. I tried some obvious hashes ("1", "11901", "1190_1", "1190.1") to no avail. Maybe this is HMAC-SHA256?

<p>It's entirely possible that the "hash" is actually randomly generated. Just a thought. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/129.21.119.153" title="Special:Contributions/129.21.119.153">129.21.119.153</a> 07:03, 25 March 2013 (UTC)
</p><p>Regarding sha256. Its most likely some hash of a timestamp, but if he doesnt wants us to crack it, he would have prefixes a password.. sha256('secretcode17:30'). Im just saying, if he doesnt wants us to crack it, we most likely cant.

Is it just me or or did Randall manage to make all of us perform a Denial of Service on xkcd.com, and explainxkcd.com&#160;? xkcd.com seems much slower, and I keep getting "500 Internal server error" when accessing this site (explainxkcd.com).

</p><p>Earlier today, the server handled all the image redirections. The script you see above went through several mutations (currently at #8), with each mutation it seems that Randall is adding more servers and trying to split the load between them. This is basically how a bot-net works - we all run code written by some evil genius, and he's changing the code as time passes to serve some hidden purpose.

Also, since it's not April 1st, and Randall has consistently released something major on that day, the jury is still out, leaving my question quite open (though I was really only asking for opinions). <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/76.106.251.87" title="Special:Contributions/76.106.251.87">76.106.251.87</a> 07:20, 26 March 2013 (UTC)

<p>Considering the common theme with "today's" strip, anyone wanna guess that he's sending us a hex-encoded file over a really slow modem link, slated to complete April 1?

Here's a quick summary though: it holds open a connection to xkcd's servers and listens for instructions and follows them. Those instructions are either "load a new image" or "reload the page". So, you don't have to mash F5, it will automatically update the image when they're available. We have no way to control how fast the images come or when they do, and it's quite possible for them to update forever. --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Fiveofoh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Fiveofoh (page does not exist)">Fiveofoh</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Fiveofoh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Fiveofoh (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 06:41, 27 March 2013 (UTC)

If a new strip goes up every 30 minutes our time, and if each strip comprises of, let's say for the sake of simplicity, one minute in their time; to build the sand castle [frames 24-117 = 93 frames] so far it's taken almost 2 days our time, which would be about an hour and a half their time if each frame is a minute.  Using my scale, an hour our time is 2 minutes their time, a day is 48 minutes, and our month is their 24 hour day.  If we assume Randall plans to give us a 24 hour period from that world's time, and we use the minute-per-frame rate I made up, than we'd probably be looking at a month of images our time.  I guess we'll just have to see how long he's got it planned to go on. -boB
</p><p>Has it ended? All that's left is the sandcastle, and there doesn't seem to have been anything else changed on it for a few hours.
</p><p>It's zooming out! When look at the gifs showing the frames in succession, the last 3 show the castle getting slightly smaller each time!
</p>
<dl><dd> It's true! The most recent also shows the edge of another castle, leading me to believe it's part of some kind of sand castle contest, probably including some of xkcd's other recurring characters!

<p>I'm seeing some strange stuff now. I have a script that uses wget of time.png to get the redirected hash png like Lockyy is doing. And I can verify that when you go to the 1190 page in the browser you get a different hash. But the previous hour and this hour, unlike the ones before it, the two hash pngs are different. And when I refresh the screen in my browser at the 1190 page, first I see the image I get from time.png, then the image refreshes with the other one. I'm not sure what this means or what we are supposed to do with it. I added the time.png hashes to the table for the last two hours but we probably need a way of indicating the difference. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Bugstomper&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Bugstomper (page does not exist)">Bugstomper</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Bugstomper" title="User talk:Bugstomper">talk</a>) 20:38, 30 March 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd> This latest hourly update did the same thing. If you are fast enough you can even get the first image in your browser by right click view image before it changes to the second one.

</dd><dd> Looking at it some more, I see that wget of the page at xkcd.com/1190/ gets you an img link to time.png and then there is the javascript that must after some delay get the different hash url image. That means that we had better be sure that we do not miss any manual checks of hourly updates because the scripts will never find that second image unless someone has a way of getting a script that runs the javascript as if it was a browser. As long as someone posts the hash of the image from the browser every hour, I can ensure that we have the hashes the scripts can get because I have a cron job checking for those updates every 15 minutes. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Bugstomper&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Bugstomper (page does not exist)">Bugstomper</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Bugstomper" title="User talk:Bugstomper">talk</a>) 21:49, 30 March 2013 (UTC)

</p><p>When Megan coughed and Cueball asked if she was okay, did anyone else think of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://xkcd.com/931/">http://xkcd.com/931/</a> Lanes? Cueball explains that cancer treatment results are not known until much later, "and often the first sign is a cough or a bone pain.  So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry . . . ." ~~wrybred
</p>
<dl><dd>I don't want to be a downer but this is just my interpretation thus far. I hope it is a happier theme but if you are correct wrybred, my further explanation would be the following... I think that building sandcastles is an analogy for living their life. Going for a swim in the body of water and the cough could represent the start of the cancer or possibly some time where they had to go out and "wade" in the possibilities of what cancer could mean. Time passes and Cueball says "I don't think we can build it much taller than this. It's been fun, though" which represents that they believe they have done as well as they can with the lives they have been given. They comment on the river retreating even though we the audience observe a body of water on the right hand side rising could represent how we can be fooled into believing things are going alright when in reality they are not. The reference to not understanding what the river is doing also fits this explanation well as someone with cancer may occasionally feel confused about their illness. Presently while I write this they are possibly preparing for a flood which represents the return of the cancer. If I were to guess what is next I might guess that they will watch as the flood comes in and destroys some of what they built but it is better than not having made the sandcastle in the first place. I could be way off, but Randall has given us a lot of TIME to think about what this is all about and your mind wanders. I also would note that this may not be about a particular cancer story, just any cancer story. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Nhoel&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Nhoel (page does not exist)">Nhoel</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Nhoel&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Nhoel (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 13:51, 8 April 2013 (UTC)

</dd><dd>It's pretty obvious to me. They're on a beach with a river running through it. Yes, beaches sometimes have rivers in them.

<dl><dd>Seriously? Ok - time to review the physics of hydrostatic fluids, folks.  Depth is the only variable in calculating fluid pressure.

<dl><dd>A small hill can stop the sea if it extends infinitely in the Z axis, otherwise the sea will simply flow around it. The other alternative is to encircle the castle with it, forming a moat, but then we wouldn't be able to see the inside. So this can't be a normal 3D universe. Lending some weight to the 2D or nearly 2D nature is that the first platform they put up was installed on only two posts. But the platform itself had width.

It would be helpful if the "Image" field instead gave an ordinal number indicating the number of frames (e.g., this would help to correlate the Transcript on this page with the frame numbers <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/">here</a>.  The current "Image" field need not be deleted (I personally prefer time in hours to time in days+hours), but it might be relabeled as "Time in Hours".  Implementing this would require some use of scripts, and would be best if adopted by the person updating the frame-by-frame breakdown in the first place.  <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/132.236.6.90" title="Special:Contributions/132.236.6.90">132.236.6.90</a> 16:42, 19 April 2013 (UTC)

When the server had a problem one image was 100 minutes late, and another was 50 minutes late. Because of this there was a file between time682 and time683 that wasn't posted here (time683 should have been time684), and many files after that are displayed here an hour before they should have been displayed, with the wrong filename. It also affects xkcd-time.wikia.com as I had got many of the files on there from here.

<p>I'm guessing that the water will keep rising indefinitely, and we'll be left with an upward-moving strip that occasionally zooms out as the bottom layers are very slowly filled in with black "water." One thing that would make this interesting is the varying heights of the constructed structures (sandcastle turrets, platform, etc.) which would make the process of "overflow" from the right-hand side interesting to watch.  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/65.96.75.37" title="Special:Contributions/65.96.75.37">65.96.75.37</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:65.96.75.37&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:65.96.75.37 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>
</p><p>Oh the symbolism of it: Cueball leaves, Megan finishes building their castle, rests and lets her guard down. The next thing to happen is, a cute girl walks in, sees what the two have built together and leaves.

</p><p>I'm expecting the lower level-castle to be swept away by the water, while the high-level castle will remain intact. This is quite reasonable, assuming Cueball and Megan knows how high the flood will come and thus they built the platform to an appropriate height. It may be interpreted as the lower-level castle being the work of our life, which is inevitable finite, and will be eventually overtaken by death. Recognizing this, some choose to build a castle for the "after-life".

<p>For me, this is clearly about cancer and the impacts it has on a relationship over time. Randall's now wife was diagnosed and treated for cancer recently and through this comic, he's trying to portray the anxious wait they faced through treatment and remission.  He has put us into his shoes by keeping us waiting in suspense to see how things end up.  The passing of time represents their life together.  At first it's just them relaxing together, probably the dating phase.  Soon they start building a life together, represented by the sand castle.  The castle evolves over time, much like their life has.  Difficulties and gaffes in their relationship are depicted, for example when cueball trips and breaks down part of the wall.  Eventually all efforts are diverted and put into defending against the approaching sea, which represents the cancer.  The wall, the platform, all represent the steps taken to prevent and/or prepare for it's impending progress.  The river represents the cure for cancer, which is still pretty far out, as cueball mentioned.  There are many many more clues I see and explanations I can give to support this idea (castle in the sky, the rain, progress with research, etc.), but this is just starting point.  I'm excited to see where the comic will end up, but I guess we just need to "wait for it".  --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Nick&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Nick (page does not exist)">Nick</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Nick&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Nick (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:25, 24 April 2013 (UTC)

<p>The cancer metaphors are quite intriguing, but my take is environmental, possibly pollution and global warming. The French girl (beret) could be a nod to the Disneyland Paris castle.

<p>I'm taking it that "sea" is a phonetic substitute for "c," "meaning "cancer."  For better or worse, this kind of phoenetic clue was used in the Batman movie:
Batman: Pretty fishy what happened to me on that ladder. 
Gordon: You mean, where there's a fish, there could be a Penguin. 
Robin: But wait! It happened at sea! See? "C" for Catwoman!
Sigh.  I wish I knew what "river" and "rain" represented.  Medicine, maybe? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/98.117.33.206" title="Special:Contributions/98.117.33.206">98.117.33.206</a> 23:03, 24 April 2013 (UTC)

<p>Well, I don't know if the intention here is that the "river" is making the "sea" grow.  My point is that the dialogue is so nonsensical at points that it seems to be code.  I'm taking every noun as a metaphor for something.  "Sea" being "cancer" seems to fit ("The cancer can't make more of itself forever, can it?")  I guess go back through the dialogue and see what other words could substitute for what they're saying.  Like I said, I don't know what "river" or "rain" or "ground" could be in this metaphor. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/98.117.33.206" title="Special:Contributions/98.117.33.206">98.117.33.206</a> 00:56, 25 April 2013 (UTC)

<p>I agree - the water has started eroding the castle to the right, and it makes sense for the erosion to potentially loop the comic back to frame 1. That said, the title text was "wait for it". This could be a euphamism suggesting "keep waiting, this comic changes", but it does have an implication that there is a "finale" to the comic that you should wait for. Hard to tell as it's vague. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:TheHYPO" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:TheHYPO" title="User talk:TheHYPO">talk</a>) 13:54, 26 April 2013 (UTC)
</p><p>The most recent event is Megan walking in, saying "bye!" in *lower case*, and leaving.  From the lower case, which is different from the rest of the comic, I infer that she was talking to *us*, not (eg) herself or the sandcastle!  I reckon it's just going to fill up with water until the page is a static black rectangle. Especially since she and Cueball just talked about going off and exploring, grabbed their bags, and left. -cosmogoblin <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/94.197.127.235" title="Special:Contributions/94.197.127.235">94.197.127.235</a> 13:57, 26 April 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd> I suspect the small text was to show a "small voice" - talking quietly and sadly perhaps? It does look like this could be the end of the story though - the last few frames don't seem to have done much after the "fade" in frame 895 - Hippyjim <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/81.136.241.157" title="Special:Contributions/81.136.241.157">81.136.241.157</a> 15:15, 26 April 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd> I agree with the small voice. The sea level is still rising, and interestingly, the sand barrier on the far right is eroding on *both sides* -- not just the seaward side, as previously. Changed properties of the sand or the sea, or both? I think the comic from here on is just going to be erosion.

(Hmmm, that reminds me of the song "River in the Sea" from the musical Ten November, a 2 minute sample available at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.prudencejohnson.com/sounds/gales/River_in_the_Sea.mp3">http://www.prudencejohnson.com/sounds/gales/River_in_the_Sea.mp3</a>). <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Meteoricshipyards&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Meteoricshipyards (page does not exist)">Meteoricshipyards</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Meteoricshipyards&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Meteoricshipyards (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 18:18, 29 April 2013 (UTC) Tom A.

<dl><dd>By "comic within a comic" I meant that not only do we await a new xkcd installment several times a week, but now we also have a single panel (1190) with an ongoing story.

<p>Just wanted to say: I don't think the beret girl is a girl at all. It's a boy with an old-fashioned navy-style cap. Popular with boys at the beach (in the old days). See images here (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x130/JTMarcus/h1.jpg">http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x130/JTMarcus/h1.jpg</a>) and here (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cabinetcardgallery.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/kidwithcap_0003.jpg">http://cabinetcardgallery.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/kidwithcap_0003.jpg</a>) I also like the fact that, just before the castle completely fades away, you can barely see the little boy bringing more materials (maybe another support beam?) to continue the work.
I like the continuity of letting the beret boy (not girl)
</p>
<dl><dd> Wether it's a navy cap or not may be open to interpretation (though I'd still bet it's a beret - it surely looks a lot more like the one the beret guy wears, and I think Randall would have put a little more effort into that detail if he wanted it to pass off as a navy cap). As for it being a boy, no. It's definitely a girl, you can clearly see it has a longer hair, and come to think of it, Randall rarely draws any hair at all for male characters anyway. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/201.53.213.201" title="Special:Contributions/201.53.213.201">201.53.213.201</a> 23:36, 29 April 2013 (UTC)

<p>Odd, it looks like +861, +862, and +863 are out of order, judging by the ground not changing at all and the characters not walking continuously.

</p><p>During the last glacial period the sea level was more than 100 meters lower than it is nowadays, so coastal structures looked very different and the continents exposed much more land. I believe the first act of this comic references medieval ages in Europe where people would witness (over the scope of hundreds of years or longer) losing land and coastal towns to the sea but not understanding the process, as Megan states. I'm expecting the second act, and possibly further acts, to reference the abundance of scientifical discoveries made during the last few centuries. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/37.201.91.80" title="Special:Contributions/37.201.91.80">37.201.91.80</a> 12:17, 30 April 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd> I thought that too initially - the terrain features certainly seems identical (to scale) to the one at the start of the story. But something's bothering me; it's about the frame before we see they are back on a beach - they are already seated, so it's fair to assume they haven't moved, yet the terrain is different. By looking at the terrain, you could guess that maybe the terrain is inverted, which would then indicate that the frame with the beach in view is from a different angle than the previous frame. But for that to be the case, Cueball would have to be behind Megan on the previous frame, yet, their positions are unchanged on these frames. So, I don't know... I'll stop rambling now, and just wait and see, I guess... --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Fernandofig&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Fernandofig (page does not exist)">Fernandofig</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Fernandofig&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Fernandofig (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 18:27, 30 April 2013 (UTC)

<p>Wait, what? It looks like they are suddenly back at a beach that looks the same as the first one, just zoomed out. But before when the scene was presumably inverted, the terrain didn't look quite like that. If the scene really did get inverted, maybe they aren't actually on a beach right now, but the sea will eventually expand until it reaches them. Then again, we don't know if this is the same plane of space that the original beach was either. They were just walking to the right. The concept of space in this comic is confusing me right now. I wonder if this will make sense later. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/129.21.63.158" title="Special:Contributions/129.21.63.158">129.21.63.158</a> 18:41, 30 April 2013 (UTC)

</p><p>It appears that the camera perspective has changed. 1 - 970 are all perpendicular to the shoreline, with the water on the right, camera looking down the shore. 971-996 are shown parallel to the shore line, with the camera position apparently out over the water or standing at the shore, looking back toward land. (If the camera had maintained the original position, the characters would have simply gotten smaller as the walked away, but instead we got to see the walk across the frame while presumably following the shore.) In 997, the camera perspective just comes back around to be a profile shot again, looking down the shoreline, water once again on the right. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/65.183.156.9" title="Special:Contributions/65.183.156.9">65.183.156.9</a> 19:40, 30 April 2013 (UTC)

<p>Just a thought - In panel 1018 (time 897), Megan states "If we don't find something today, we'll have to start using the steam bottle." If that means they're out of water... the last update has both of them drinking water at the edge of the river. No one spit it out this time.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Split_the_movie.3F"> Split the movie? </span></h2>
<p>The page is becoming impossible to load.
</p><p>I would suggest to split the movie into pieces, for instance by making a separate sub-page for each week (avoiding embarassing discussion on the most natural cutting point). Each week can have a separate description, seven-seconds animation, list of 7x24 pictures etc, and a link to the following and previous weeks.

</p>
<dl><dd>My only suggestion would be give it larger segments. I don't think it needs to be as small as a week - after all, it loaded fine for a very long time. Maybe approx. half a scene each? Scene 1 is 971 frames long, so how about split at 500, at 971, and again at 1500 (when it gets there)? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/24.129.75.17" title="Special:Contributions/24.129.75.17">24.129.75.17</a> 08:12, 8 May 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It's one and a half megabytes. The biggest issue here probably is the anemic servers that managed to struggle and crash even when that animation was just a static png and the page itself was only a few lines long.

<dl><dd>This is not real life. And they know it's not real life. Maybe they are in some sort of Matrix and know about it, or they are playing a video game. They've seen in developers' blog that devs are working on a lot of new features for version 0.19, such as improved sand physics, multiple rivers, rain, salty water, trebuchets, swimming, surf, etc. But then developers decided to release part of these features in version 0.19, and leave the rest for 0.20. When Cueball an Megan saw that version 0.19 is out, they immediately decided to try it out, without even looking at the changelog. So they don't know which features made it into this version, and which ones will be in the next one. So far they have played around with new sand physics and trebuchets, tried swimming in the sea, tried to drink sea water, found a new river. They haven't seen any surf, so they think it'll be in 0.20. They have yet to try swimming in a river, or see the rain. They have also found a bug that causes sea level to raise indefinitely. They think it could be caused either by rain, additional rivers, or just by a griefer who built a giant sand generator array to fill in the sea and flood everything. Oh, and they can't just create a new private world to see if the sea raises there, because of the DRM.

<p>Swimming in a river is dangerous if there's a strong current. Even slow moving water has a lot of power.

<dl><dd>I wasn't shouting, there is no need to bring ad hominem into this discussion. There are a number of solutions available here; we could tabulate frames per month as per <a href="/wiki/index.php/explain_xkcd:Community_portal/Proposals#Time:_The_Table" title="explain xkcd:Community portal/Proposals">this neglected post</a>, offload prior months to other pages, or scrap old hashes to cut a large portion of the article's body text. Each solution will lead to degradation of the explanation, splitting the article will force multiple page loads while removing the hash values will be destroying part of the metadata around the comic. Ideally, we wouldn't have to make the split at all, but speed considerations mean that we eventually will have to do it. In that eventuality, all we can do is the thing that degrades the explanation for the average visitor the least. What do visitors care more about, faster load times/having all the frames on one page or having 1000-odd incomprehensible and meaningless hash values? We don't display the individual filenames for Click and Drag even though they were more informative than the hashes here, because they hold little value to visitors; they only take up space that could be used to further enhance the explanation. Pure archival without curation is what other websites do, not a wiki with the intended goal of making xkcd accessible. <b><a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Davidy22" title="User:Davidy22"><u><span style="color:#707">David</span><font color="#070" size="3">y</font></u><font color="#508" size="4">²²</font></a></b><a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Davidy22" title="User talk:Davidy22"><tt>[talk]</tt></a> 23:56, 12 May 2013 (UTC)

<p>So Cueball and Megan seem to entering a region with much more vegetation. Up until now I had assumed that the previous regions had vegetation as well but Randall just hadn't bothered drawing it (such detail is rare in XKCD). So what does presence of vegetation mean? More rainfall? Higher elevation? Also how far have Cueball and Megan travelled? I don't think the frames are necessarily contiguous - if this was a movie we'd have background music to go with the images. They could have been travelling for days or weeks - I definitely don't think it is still the same day as the start of Act II.

<p>Here's another example of the slightly 'strange' way of talking: "I'm surprised we haven't been seen by any people yet". Wouldn't most people say: "I'm surprised we haven't seen any people yet"?

</p><p>The latest frame (1506) has two trees. They are almost certainly baobab trees. There are 8 species of baobab tree, but of those 8, 6 are endemic to the island of Madagascar, including the species which the trees in the comic most resemble, the Grandidier baobab. Even if they are not one of the six species endemic to Madagascar, the fact that they are baobabs still limits them to the continent of Africa, the countries of Oman and Yemen, and northwestern Australia. This means that the big sea, if it is an ocean, is most likely the Indian Ocean. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/76.92.118.150" title="Special:Contributions/76.92.118.150">76.92.118.150</a> 18:30, 21 May 2013 (UTC)
