<p>This comic is a (still ongoing) series of pictures, that <i>was</i> updating every 30 minutes, but is now updating on the hour. As of this writing, it is still updated after more than 246 hours - even after several new, different comics have been posted on the front page.
</p><p>The comic appears to be an illustration of passing time. From the spectator's point of view, each image is meaningless by itself&#160;; the only possible perception of time is to "<i>wait for it</i>" and see how things evolve. Thus, time is in the spectator's perception, not in each individual frame.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Technical_hack"> Technical hack </span></h3>
<p>The updating is done server-side, with the server redirecting the image link (time.png) to a different image every hour. It is impossible to load future images (except for one image that was revealed during a glitch), so readers have to wait for the story to unfold in real time. On the xkcd site itself, one cannot see the past either, only the current image. Past images are available from xkcd if you have the direct link for each image. Multiple fan sites, including this one, have stored past images as well as the links to the originals.

<dl><dd> I would also like to add that knowing randall, these are not the only images. For all we know, the image will still be changing in 5 years while a tree grows in front of them. My point is: Are the URLs hackable, or did he encrypt them? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121" title="Special:Contributions/199.30.248.121">199.30.248.121</a> 05:33, 25 March 2013 (UTC)

<p>Likely there is a way to hack the URLs; they look like some sort of hash, probably a hashed timestamp. Of course, he could easily have added some salt to the hash, making it significantly *harder* to hack. But they're strings of a specific length, so it should be pretty easy to bruteforce it, fetch all the images, and then (maybe) reverse-engineer the sequence. *That* all depends on how many of them there are. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/76.90.249.178" title="Special:Contributions/76.90.249.178">76.90.249.178</a> 05:44, 25 March 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd> The URLs are 64 hex characters. If he doesnt want us to find these pictures ahead of time, he would have made them completely random data, not a hash of anything. There are 16 possibilites for hex characters so 16^64 combinations or 1.7x10^308 combinations. If we made a supercomputer to try a billion links per second, and if there are 10,000 images total, it would take 4×10^277 × 13.77 billion years, which is a number with 277 zeros times the age of the universe to find just the first additional image. The sun will expand into a red giant and engulf the earth or at least come close enough to boil off all the water in the oceans in a mere 5.4 billion years, less than even one additional age of the universe. It will even be after the last star to ever be born has burned out, and all life in the universe has died before we could find even one. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/65.50.74.245" title="Special:Contributions/65.50.74.245">65.50.74.245</a> 19:11, 16 June 2013 (UTC)

<p>It seems that the image is updated every 1/2 hour. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/152.23.97.150" title="Special:Contributions/152.23.97.150">152.23.97.150</a> 06:17, 25 March 2013 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd> Given that the images switch back and forth between other images already seen, and that the comic should be viewable in the future, it seems unlikely that it's any thing like a simple sha256 of part of the timestamp.  I think it's more likely a function of half-hours and minutes (assuming we continue to get a new possible image every half-hour). <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/99.153.248.206" title="Special:Contributions/99.153.248.206">99.153.248.206</a> 06:59, 25 March 2013 (UTC)

<p>Hash appears to be SHA-256. I tried some obvious hashes ("1", "11901", "1190_1", "1190.1") to no avail. Maybe this is HMAC-SHA256? Also, I would suggest trying Unix timestamps. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/131.156.236.149" title="Special:Contributions/131.156.236.149">131.156.236.149</a> 06:19, 25 March 2013 (UTC)

<p>It's entirely possible that the "hash" is actually randomly generated. Just a thought. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/129.21.119.153" title="Special:Contributions/129.21.119.153">129.21.119.153</a> 07:03, 25 March 2013 (UTC)
</p><p>Regarding sha256. Its most likely some hash of a timestamp, but if he doesnt wants us to crack it, he would have prefixes a password.. sha256('secretcode17:30'). Im just saying, if he doesnt wants us to crack it, we most likely cant.
I've tested all unixtimestamps from 1300000000 to 1364390334.

</p><p>Alright, this is probably not going to work, but I'm trying to exploit Randall's awesomeness here. Maybe he decided to take the time-stamps from the user? I don't know if that's even possible... That would then allow people in different time zones to obtain different images simultaneously. (What's the corollary of Godwin's law for a bunch of math-and-science nerds and relativity? Is there one?) Clicking the img src url on the comic's html page, give me this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/752687b61523144c61736cd89f8c153dc41e19128f72d78d44947ff800f057fa.png">http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time/752687b61523144c61736cd89f8c153dc41e19128f72d78d44947ff800f057fa.png</a>&#160;: Never mind.. apparently others see the same image too.

Is it just me or or did Randall manage to make all of us perform a Denial of Service on xkcd.com, and explainxkcd.com&#160;? xkcd.com seems much slower, and I keep getting "500 Internal server error" when accessing this site (explainxkcd.com). I guess that's the effect of having everybody hit F5 every few minutes&#160;:) <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/193.239.192.194" title="Special:Contributions/193.239.192.194">193.239.192.194</a> 11:57, 25 March 2013 (UTC)
</p><p>Earlier today, the server handled all the image redirections. The script you see above went through several mutations (currently at #8), with each mutation it seems that Randall is adding more servers and trying to split the load between them. This is basically how a bot-net works - we all run code written by some evil genius, and he's changing the code as time passes to serve some hidden purpose.

<p>When I saw this comic last night and that there was no explanation up, I thought to myself "How zen."  I figured that Randall was going through a calm streak before throwing us the utterly ridiculous April 1st comic.  Did it come early, or does he have something even bigger planned for us? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/76.106.251.87" title="Special:Contributions/76.106.251.87">76.106.251.87</a> 07:05, 26 March 2013 (UTC)

Of course, it is now "now" and there <i>is</i> an explanation, so that should answer your question.  Also, since it's not April 1st, and Randall has consistently released something major on that day, the jury is still out, leaving my question quite open (though I was really only asking for opinions). <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/76.106.251.87" title="Special:Contributions/76.106.251.87">76.106.251.87</a> 07:20, 26 March 2013 (UTC)

<p>Considering the common theme with "today's" strip, anyone wanna guess that he's sending us a hex-encoded file over a really slow modem link, slated to complete April 1?

</p><p>For those wondering about the Javascript behind this: I posted my analysis of the Javascript <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.echochamber.me/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=101043&amp;start=760#p3303579">on the xkcd forums</a>, and further de-obfuscated and annotated the code over on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://gist.github.com/cincodenada/5246094">GitHub</a>.  Here's a quick summary though: it holds open a connection to xkcd's servers and listens for instructions and follows them. Those instructions are either "load a new image" or "reload the page". So, you don't have to mash F5, it will automatically update the image when they're available. We have no way to control how fast the images come or when they do, and it's quite possible for them to update forever. --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Fiveofoh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Fiveofoh (page does not exist)">Fiveofoh</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Fiveofoh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Fiveofoh (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 06:41, 27 March 2013 (UTC)

If a new strip goes up every 30 minutes our time, and if each strip comprises of, let's say for the sake of simplicity, one minute in their time; to build the sand castle [frames 24-117 = 93 frames] so far it's taken almost 2 days our time, which would be about an hour and a half their time if each frame is a minute.  Using my scale, an hour our time is 2 minutes their time, a day is 48 minutes, and our month is their 24 hour day.  If we assume Randall plans to give us a 24 hour period from that world's time, and we use the minute-per-frame rate I made up, than we'd probably be looking at a month of images our time.

<p>I'm seeing some strange stuff now. I have a script that uses wget of time.png to get the redirected hash png like Lockyy is doing. And I can verify that when you go to the 1190 page in the browser you get a different hash. But the previous hour and this hour, unlike the ones before it, the two hash pngs are different. And when I refresh the screen in my browser at the 1190 page, first I see the image I get from time.png, then the image refreshes with the other one. I'm not sure what this means or what we are supposed to do with it. I added the time.png hashes to the table for the last two hours but we probably need a way of indicating the difference. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Bugstomper&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Bugstomper (page does not exist)">Bugstomper</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Bugstomper" title="User talk:Bugstomper">talk</a>) 20:38, 30 March 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd> This latest hourly update did the same thing. If you are fast enough you can even get the first image in your browser by right click view image before it changes to the second one.

</dd><dd> Looking at it some more, I see that wget of the page at xkcd.com/1190/ gets you an img link to time.png and then there is the javascript that must after some delay get the different hash url image. That means that we had better be sure that we do not miss any manual checks of hourly updates because the scripts will never find that second image unless someone has a way of getting a script that runs the javascript as if it was a browser.

</p><p>When Megan coughed and Cueball asked if she was okay, did anyone else think of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://xkcd.com/931/">http://xkcd.com/931/</a> Lanes? Cueball explains that cancer treatment results are not known until much later, "and often the first sign is a cough or a bone pain.  So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry . . . ." ~~wrybred
</p>
<dl><dd>I don't want to be a downer but this is just my interpretation thus far. I hope it is a happier theme but if you are correct wrybred, my further explanation would be the following... I think that building sandcastles is an analogy for living their life. Going for a swim in the body of water and the cough could represent the start of the cancer or possibly some time where they had to go out and "wade" in the possibilities of what cancer could mean. Time passes and Cueball says "I don't think we can build it much taller than this. It's been fun, though" which represents that they believe they have done as well as they can with the lives they have been given. They comment on the river retreating even though we the audience observe a body of water on the right hand side rising could represent how we can be fooled into believing things are going alright when in reality they are not. The reference to not understanding what the river is doing also fits this explanation well as someone with cancer may occasionally feel confused about their illness. Presently while I write this they are possibly preparing for a flood which represents the return of the cancer. If I were to guess what is next I might guess that they will watch as the flood comes in and destroys some of what they built but it is better than not having made the sandcastle in the first place. I could be way off, but Randall has given us a lot of TIME to think about what this is all about and your mind wanders. I also would note that this may not be about a particular cancer story, just any cancer story. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Nhoel&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Nhoel (page does not exist)">Nhoel</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Nhoel&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Nhoel (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 13:51, 8 April 2013 (UTC)

</dd><dd>It's pretty obvious to me. They're on a beach with a river running through it. Yes, beaches sometimes have rivers in them.

<p>My favorite episode from the Batman TV series was one where the Riddler gave Batman a nonsense clue which contained a surveillance microphone. He'd then eavesdrop on what Batman “deducted” his next coup would be, and he made it happen. Seeing how the discussion here does seem to affect the events in the comic, I wonder if Randall is pulling a Riddler on us. Just as an experiment, I thought I'd mention that it's odd there are no seagulls at the beach&#160;;-) <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/201.235.179.15" title="Special:Contributions/201.235.179.15">201.235.179.15</a> 16:49, 17 April 2013 (UTC)

<p>In the frame-by-frame breakdown, the "Image" field simply gives the time in hours, while the "Time" field gives the time in days+hours.  It would be helpful if the "Image" field instead gave an ordinal number indicating the number of frames (e.g., this would help to correlate the Transcript on this page with the frame numbers <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/">here</a>.  The current "Image" field need not be deleted (I personally prefer time in hours to time in days+hours), but it might be relabeled as "Time in Hours".  Implementing this would require some use of scripts, and would be best if adopted by the person updating the frame-by-frame breakdown in the first place.  <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/132.236.6.90" title="Special:Contributions/132.236.6.90">132.236.6.90</a> 16:42, 19 April 2013 (UTC)

When the server had a problem one image was 100 minutes late, and another was 50 minutes late. Because of this there was a file between time682 and time683 that wasn't posted here (time683 should have been time684), and many files after that are displayed here an hour before they should have been displayed, with the wrong filename.

<p>I'm guessing that the water will keep rising indefinitely, and we'll be left with an upward-moving strip that occasionally zooms out as the bottom layers are very slowly filled in with black "water." One thing that would make this interesting is the varying heights of the constructed structures (sandcastle turrets, platform, etc.) which would make the process of "overflow" from the right-hand side interesting to watch.  <small><a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/65.96.75.37" title="Special:Contributions/65.96.75.37">65.96.75.37</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:65.96.75.37&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:65.96.75.37 (page does not exist)">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small>
</p><p>Oh the symbolism of it: Cueball leaves, Megan finishes building their castle, rests and lets her guard down.

</p><p>I'm expecting the lower level-castle to be swept away by the water, while the high-level castle will remain intact. This is quite reasonable, assuming Cueball and Megan knows how high the flood will come and thus they built the platform to an appropriate height. It may be interpreted as the lower-level castle being the work of our life, which is inevitable finite, and will be eventually overtaken by death. Recognizing this, some choose to build a castle for the "after-life".

<p>For me, this is clearly about cancer and the impacts it has on a relationship over time. Randall's now wife was diagnosed and treated for cancer recently and through this comic, he's trying to portray the anxious wait they faced through treatment and remission.  He has put us into his shoes by keeping us waiting in suspense to see how things end up.  The passing of time represents their life together.  At first it's just them relaxing together, probably the dating phase.  Soon they start building a life together, represented by the sand castle.  The castle evolves over time, much like their life has.  Difficulties and gaffes in their relationship are depicted, for example when cueball trips and breaks down part of the wall.  Eventually all efforts are diverted and put into defending against the approaching sea, which represents the cancer.  The wall, the platform, all represent the steps taken to prevent and/or prepare for it's impending progress.  The river represents the cure for cancer, which is still pretty far out, as cueball mentioned.  There are many many more clues I see and explanations I can give to support this idea (castle in the sky, the rain, progress with research, etc.), but this is just starting point.  I'm excited to see where the comic will end up, but I guess we just need to "wait for it".  --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Nick&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Nick (page does not exist)">Nick</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Nick&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Nick (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:25, 24 April 2013 (UTC)

<p>I'm taking it that "sea" is a phonetic substitute for "c," "meaning "cancer."  For better or worse, this kind of phoenetic clue was used in the Batman movie:
Batman: Pretty fishy what happened to me on that ladder. 
Gordon: You mean, where there's a fish, there could be a Penguin. 
Robin: But wait! It happened at sea! See? "C" for Catwoman!
Sigh.  I wish I knew what "river" and "rain" represented.  Medicine, maybe? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/98.117.33.206" title="Special:Contributions/98.117.33.206">98.117.33.206</a> 23:03, 24 April 2013 (UTC)

<p>Well, I don't know if the intention here is that the "river" is making the "sea" grow.  My point is that the dialogue is so nonsensical at points that it seems to be code.  I'm taking every noun as a metaphor for something.  "Sea" being "cancer" seems to fit ("The cancer can't make more of itself forever, can it?")  I guess go back through the dialogue and see what other words could substitute for what they're saying.  Like I said, I don't know what "river" or "rain" or "ground" could be in this metaphor. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/98.117.33.206" title="Special:Contributions/98.117.33.206">98.117.33.206</a> 00:56, 25 April 2013 (UTC)

I think this is the last day.  It's been exactly a month, they seem pretty done with it, and tomorrow's friday....On top of that, the most recent comic was the flipping of a switch on a time machine, in which, something happened, but we don't yet know what....it may be that the "Time" comic is being refreshed.  ...Just a thought....  <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/138.49.1.8" title="Special:Contributions/138.49.1.8">138.49.1.8</a> 03:20, 26 April 2013 (UTC)Luke Wah

<p>I agree - the water has started eroding the castle to the right, and it makes sense for the erosion to potentially loop the comic back to frame 1. That said, the title text was "wait for it". This could be a euphamism suggesting "keep waiting, this comic changes", but it does have an implication that there is a "finale" to the comic that you should wait for. Hard to tell as it's vague. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:TheHYPO" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:TheHYPO" title="User talk:TheHYPO">talk</a>) 13:54, 26 April 2013 (UTC)
</p><p>The most recent event is Megan walking in, saying "bye!" in *lower case*, and leaving.  From the lower case, which is different from the rest of the comic, I infer that she was talking to *us*, not (eg) herself or the sandcastle!  I reckon it's just going to fill up with water until the page is a static black rectangle. Especially since she and Cueball just talked about going off and exploring, grabbed their bags, and left. -cosmogoblin <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/94.197.127.235" title="Special:Contributions/94.197.127.235">94.197.127.235</a> 13:57, 26 April 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd> I suspect the small text was to show a "small voice" - talking quietly and sadly perhaps? It does look like this could be the end of the story though - the last few frames don't seem to have done much after the "fade" in frame 895 - Hippyjim <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/81.136.241.157" title="Special:Contributions/81.136.241.157">81.136.241.157</a> 15:15, 26 April 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd> I agree with the small voice. The sea level is still rising, and interestingly, the sand barrier on the far right is eroding on *both sides* -- not just the seaward side, as previously.

<p>Just wanted to say: I don't think the beret girl is a girl at all. It's a boy with an old-fashioned navy-style cap. Popular with boys at the beach (in the old days). See images here (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x130/JTMarcus/h1.jpg">http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x130/JTMarcus/h1.jpg</a>) and here (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cabinetcardgallery.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/kidwithcap_0003.jpg">http://cabinetcardgallery.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/kidwithcap_0003.jpg</a>) I also like the fact that, just before the castle completely fades away, you can barely see the little boy bringing more materials (maybe another support beam?) to continue the work.
I like the continuity of letting the beret boy (not girl)
</p>
<dl><dd> Wether it's a navy cap or not may be open to interpretation (though I'd still bet it's a beret - it surely looks a lot more like the one the beret guy wears, and I think Randall would have put a little more effort into that detail if he wanted it to pass off as a navy cap). As for it being a boy, no. It's definitely a girl, you can clearly see it has a longer hair, and come to think of it, Randall rarely draws any hair at all for male characters anyway. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/201.53.213.201" title="Special:Contributions/201.53.213.201">201.53.213.201</a> 23:36, 29 April 2013 (UTC)

<p>Odd, it looks like +861, +862, and +863 are out of order, judging by the ground not changing at all and the characters not walking continuously.

</p><p>During the last glacial period the sea level was more than 100 meters lower than it is nowadays, so coastal structures looked very different and the continents exposed much more land. I believe the first act of this comic references medieval ages in Europe where people would witness (over the scope of hundreds of years or longer) losing land and coastal towns to the sea but not understanding the process, as Megan states. I'm expecting the second act, and possibly further acts, to reference the abundance of scientifical discoveries made during the last few centuries. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/37.201.91.80" title="Special:Contributions/37.201.91.80">37.201.91.80</a> 12:17, 30 April 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd> I thought that too initially - the terrain features certainly seems identical (to scale) to the one at the start of the story. But something's bothering me; it's about the frame before we see they are back on a beach - they are already seated, so it's fair to assume they haven't moved, yet the terrain is different. By looking at the terrain, you could guess that maybe the terrain is inverted, which would then indicate that the frame with the beach in view is from a different angle than the previous frame. But for that to be the case, Cueball would have to be behind Megan on the previous frame, yet, their positions are unchanged on these frames. So, I don't know... I'll stop rambling now, and just wait and see, I guess... --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Fernandofig&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Fernandofig (page does not exist)">Fernandofig</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Fernandofig&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Fernandofig (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 18:27, 30 April 2013 (UTC)

<p>Wait, what? It looks like they are suddenly back at a beach that looks the same as the first one, just zoomed out. But before when the scene was presumably inverted, the terrain didn't look quite like that. If the scene really did get inverted, maybe they aren't actually on a beach right now, but the sea will eventually expand until it reaches them. Then again, we don't know if this is the same plane of space that the original beach was either. They were just walking to the right. The concept of space in this comic is confusing me right now. I wonder if this will make sense later. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/129.21.63.158" title="Special:Contributions/129.21.63.158">129.21.63.158</a> 18:41, 30 April 2013 (UTC)

</p><p>It appears that the camera perspective has changed. 1 - 970 are all perpendicular to the shoreline, with the water on the right, camera looking down the shore. 971-996 are shown parallel to the shore line, with the camera position apparently out over the water or standing at the shore, looking back toward land. (If the camera had maintained the original position, the characters would have simply gotten smaller as the walked away, but instead we got to see the walk across the frame while presumably following the shore.) In 997, the camera perspective just comes back around to be a profile shot again, looking down the shoreline, water once again on the right. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/65.183.156.9" title="Special:Contributions/65.183.156.9">65.183.156.9</a> 19:40, 30 April 2013 (UTC)

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Split_the_movie.3F"> Split the movie? </span></h2>
<p>The page is becoming impossible to load.
</p><p>I would suggest to split the movie into pieces, for instance by making a separate sub-page for each week (avoiding embarassing discussion on the most natural cutting point). Each week can have a separate description, seven-seconds animation, list of 7x24 pictures etc, and a link to the following and previous weeks.

</p>
<dl><dd>My only suggestion would be give it larger segments. I don't think it needs to be as small as a week - after all, it loaded fine for a very long time. Maybe approx. half a scene each? Scene 1 is 971 frames long, so how about split at 500, at 971, and again at 1500 (when it gets there)? <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/24.129.75.17" title="Special:Contributions/24.129.75.17">24.129.75.17</a> 08:12, 8 May 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It's one and a half megabytes. The biggest issue here probably is the anemic servers that managed to struggle and crash even when that animation was just a static png and the page itself was only a few lines long. When the image starts clocking in at ~4-5 megabytes, it'll probably get to be a proper problem for those on poor connections, but we're not quite there yet. <b><a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Davidy22" title="User:Davidy22"><u><span style="color:#707">David</span><font color="#070" size="3">y</font></u><font color="#508" size="4">²²</font></a></b><a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Davidy22" title="User talk:Davidy22"><tt>[talk]</tt></a> 08:36, 8 May 2013 (UTC)

<p>Here is a possible breackdown structure where sequences are ~130 pictures long&#160;: (number of frames / Start frame number))
</p><p>Part 1&#160;: Sand Castles
</p>
<pre>(127) 001:  First sand castle
(105) 128&#160;: Second sand castle (180) and Catapulte
(090) 233&#160;: Joining castles
(100) 323&#160;: Miniature castle
(116) 423&#160;: Scaffold
(131) 539&#160;: Plattform
(132) 670&#160;: Fourth castle
(173) 802&#160;: Sea rising &amp; fade out
</pre>
<p>Part 2&#160;: Wildernesses
</p>
<pre>(150) 975&#160;: Seashore
(100) 1125&#160;: Rivershore
(115) 1225 –&#160;: Hills
(087) 1340 - 1363 – 1379&#160;: Trees
(124) 1427&#160;: Baobabs
1551 – 1581 Berries
1619 – Squirrel
1640 Berries
</pre>
<p>Suggestions that can be discussed&#160;:
</p>
<ul><li> Sequences should be 100-150 pictures long (with possible exceptions).
</li><li> Even if the image is not that big, the length of the movie can be a problem when one wants to check for details&#160;: short sequences allow for a slower pace.
</li><li> Good cutting points would be&#160;: two consecutive identical pictures, changes of scenery. Sequences with the same theme should on the contrary be kept together when possible.

<dl><dd>This is not real life. And they know it's not real life. Maybe they are in some sort of Matrix and know about it, or they are playing a video game. They've seen in developers' blog that devs are working on a lot of new features for version 0.19, such as improved sand physics, multiple rivers, rain, salty water, trebuchets, swimming, surf, etc. But then developers decided to release part of these features in version 0.19, and leave the rest for 0.20. When Cueball an Megan saw that version 0.19 is out, they immediately decided to try it out, without even looking at the changelog. So they don't know which features made it into this version, and which ones will be in the next one. So far they have played around with new sand physics and trebuchets, tried swimming in the sea, tried to drink sea water, found a new river. They haven't seen any surf, so they think it'll be in 0.20. They have yet to try swimming in a river, or see the rain. They have also found a bug that causes sea level to raise indefinitely. They think it could be caused either by rain, additional rivers, or just by a griefer who built a giant sand generator array to fill in the sea and flood everything. Oh, and they can't just create a new private world to see if the sea raises there, because of the DRM.

<p>Swimming in a river is dangerous if there's a strong current. Even slow moving water has a lot of power. The sea could be the ocean, connected to the ocean, or one of the large bodies of water referred to as a sea.

</p><p>We know: "The sea is big" and "The river is small".

New point: I joined all the images covering their journey since image 1150 (last stop for water). it spans 18204 pixels.

<dl><dd>I wasn't shouting, there is no need to bring ad hominem into this discussion. There are a number of solutions available here; we could tabulate frames per month as per <a href="/wiki/index.php/explain_xkcd:Community_portal/Proposals#Time:_The_Table" title="explain xkcd:Community portal/Proposals">this neglected post</a>, offload prior months to other pages, or scrap old hashes to cut a large portion of the article's body text. Each solution will lead to degradation of the explanation, splitting the article will force multiple page loads while removing the hash values will be destroying part of the metadata around the comic. Ideally, we wouldn't have to make the split at all, but speed considerations mean that we eventually will have to do it. In that eventuality, all we can do is the thing that degrades the explanation for the average visitor the least. What do visitors care more about, faster load times/having all the frames on one page or having 1000-odd incomprehensible and meaningless hash values? We don't display the individual filenames for Click and Drag even though they were more informative than the hashes here, because they hold little value to visitors; they only take up space that could be used to further enhance the explanation. Pure archival without curation is what other websites do, not a wiki with the intended goal of making xkcd accessible. <b><a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Davidy22" title="User:Davidy22"><u><span style="color:#707">David</span><font color="#070" size="3">y</font></u><font color="#508" size="4">²²</font></a></b><a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Davidy22" title="User talk:Davidy22"><tt>[talk]</tt></a> 23:56, 12 May 2013 (UTC)

<p>So Cueball and Megan seem to entering a region with much more vegetation. Up until now I had assumed that the previous regions had vegetation as well but Randall just hadn't bothered drawing it (such detail is rare in XKCD). So what does presence of vegetation mean? More rainfall? Higher elevation? Also how far have Cueball and Megan travelled? I don't think the frames are necessarily contiguous - if this was a movie we'd have background music to go with the images. They could have been travelling for days or weeks - I definitely don't think it is still the same day as the start of Act II.

<p>Here's another example of the slightly 'strange' way of talking: "I'm surprised we haven't been seen by any people yet". Wouldn't most people say: "I'm surprised we haven't seen any people yet"? So who are 'people'? Are 'people' somehow invisible to both Cueball and Megan? Are 'people' a threat? Have 'people' also moved on because of the rising sea level? <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Joncaves&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Joncaves (page does not exist)">Joncaves</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Joncaves&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Joncaves (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:25, 17 May 2013 (UTC)

<p>The latest frame (1506) has two trees. They are almost certainly baobab trees. There are 8 species of baobab tree, but of those 8, 6 are endemic to the island of Madagascar, including the species which the trees in the comic most resemble, the Grandidier baobab. Even if they are not one of the six species endemic to Madagascar, the fact that they are baobabs still limits them to the continent of Africa, the countries of Oman and Yemen, and northwestern Australia. This means that the big sea, if it is an ocean, is most likely the Indian Ocean. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/76.92.118.150" title="Special:Contributions/76.92.118.150">76.92.118.150</a> 18:30, 21 May 2013 (UTC)

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="A_hypothesis"> A hypothesis </span></h2>
<p>Randall's animation is taking place in a distant, post-collapse future ("distant" is relative, here-- say sometime in the next few hundred years, though possibly much further): human civilization is back at a late-Iron Age stage of development, though maybe with slightly more sophisticated metallurgy. The reasons I suggest this are: 1) rising sea-level that is on-going, 2) they can work wood and they have agriculture, 3) they have shown no awareness of any more "advanced" technology, 4) yet they have no qualms about wandering off into the wilderness without what most of us would consider adequate protection.
</p><p>The one reason I might think it's farther into the future is the bit with the trees. I can't decide if their shape is a consequence of evolution (convergent, so that they are very similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia_grandidieri" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Adansonia grandidieri">Adansonia grandidieri</a>), or they were transplanted (presumably to somewhere south? Higher altitude? Both? Antarctica?). Evolution would imply deeper in the future, and transplantation could be sooner.

But they haven't been gone for a long time, because we've seen a staked sapling that is likely only a year or two old. They have vineyards and what look to be orchards. They appear to use tents, at least the frame we saw looked to be tied together at the top to form a teepee frame.

</p><p>They are also apparently now heading west, or mostly west.  Their shadows are in front of them, and while that could be west in the morning or east in the evening, they are contrasting it with walking into the sun in the morning as they were along the shore, so it's west. Presumably they were walking mostly north until the decision to head for the mountains, since Cueball has just started playing with his shadow. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Tavella (page does not exist)">Tavella</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Tavella (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 00:50, 30 May 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd>OK, but they are walking to the sun in the morning. That's east (on northern hemisphere, I still do not think we are at Madagascar). So we do have an other fact:

<dl><dd>-If you walk into the sun, you are walking east.
</dd><dd>-They then turned to their left to go upriver. That's would be going north.
</dd><dd>-If you are above the tropics, your shadow will always lay to the north of you.
</dd><dd>-Megan says what they're doing is better than when they had to walk into the sun, and it's been established that they walked along the sea for days, so they'd be familiar with walking with the sun directly behind them, too. If they were now walking west, it would pretty much be the same situation, except reversed. It doesn't really make sense to me that she'd call one situation better than the other. It feels more like they aren't walking into the sun <i>at all</i> anymore. Therefore, I think they are now keeping the sun relatively behind them by going north, which indicates they are north of the equator, and probably north of the Tropic of Cancer. Even at noon, the sun would be behind you slightly, to the south. And if you're walking uphill, it would be very visible to you.

<dl><dd>No, their shadows are in front of them, so they are either walking west in the morning or east in the evening.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Snake_Theories"> Snake Theories </span></h2>
<p>Megan mentions snakes with spikes over their eyes. That covers several species, all poisonous, but they are native to the American west and southwest, Mexico, Central America, north Africa and the Middle East. The snake that Cueball finds might be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anguis_fragilis" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Anguis fragilis">slow-worm</a>, a limbless reptile native to Eurasia. It's shiny, brown, has a blunt head, and can shed its tail like a lizard, which might give it a half-finished look if Cueball saw it that way. But a stronger contender is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rubber_boa" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:rubber boa">rubber boa</a>, which is native to the western US, and has a famously stubby head and tail.

The tallest Baobob tree is 516 px (rescaled to the running comic) = 77.4 ft (23.6 m) using a 6 ft Cueball. Note that using a 5.5 ft (1.7 m) Cueball, the tree drops to 71 ft (21.6 m). The Wikipedia page <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia_grandidieri">[11]</a> on the Grandidier's baobab states they can reach 25 to 30 m (80-100 ft) in height, 23.6 m is about right. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Galois" title="User:Galois">Galois</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Galois" title="User talk:Galois">talk</a>) 23:40, 4 June 2013 (UTC)
</p><p>I don't follow this as religously as others so maybe I missed the obvious answer, but why is it assumed that we have seen all of the way they went?

Randall runs 3-5 frame updates with the two walking across the same panel. As they leave one panel on the right, they enter the next on the left (and visa-verse for the trip back to the sunken castle). Additionally, I only came across three panels that didn't adjoin perfectly (one in the sand dunes and two trees that didn't continue into the next panel). <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Galois" title="User:Galois">Galois</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Galois" title="User talk:Galois">talk</a>) 11:12, 6 June 2013 (UTC)

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Philosophical_implications"> Philosophical implications </span></h2>
<p>I think the huge following that this comic has gathered - the amount of work by people like Aubron Wood and the guys at geekwagon, explainxkcd editors, general xkcd enthusiasts, the people at XKCD time wiki - raises some interesting questions. At this point we're not even clear how Randall is writing these comics: he may have designed them all from the start, or he may be writing 24 a day, going along with it, according to the natural progression of events and what has led up to now. It has interesting parallels with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/design_argument" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:design argument">design argument</a>. It also makes you wonder about how it's all going to end. There are so many ongoing discussions - and have been from the start - about how the comic is going to conclude. Just as in real life we take so many different roads and never really know where we're going to end up. If we're continuing with the religious theme we could extend the metaphor even further, about what happens after we die. We don't know if we're going to just stop existing or if we're going to end up in some elaborate afterlife. We don't know what Randall's going to do - how long will the comic go on? Could it last his entire lifetime? We have no way of knowing. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Mynotoar" title="User:Mynotoar">Mynotoar</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Mynotoar" title="User talk:Mynotoar">talk</a>) 14:05, 8 June 2013 (UTC)
</p><p>I believe Randall is writing this as it goes along, preparing the scenes only a little bit in advance. The story (quest?) reads more like a series of isolated vignettes, but with a few themes being carried forward, such as the quest for the source of the rising sea. I'm here in homage to Randall's unique wit and humor, and having fun trying to second guess what he'll do next. I don't believe the setting is an actual place, but we have several clues that limit its location. I see this as a collection of disparate objects and events; some go together, some not, but with some running themes. Randall may be making some points (such as conservation, ecology, and not eating squirrels); although, I would have never filled a canteen from the small river without first boiling or purifying the water. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Galois" title="User:Galois">Galois</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Galois" title="User talk:Galois">talk</a>) 14:27, 8 June 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd> The sea thing is certainly a problem for any modern-day Utah theory, but the tree that recently came on-screen (frame 2145) could be intended to be <i>Pinus longaeva</i>, which would be appropriate to Utah (or many other parts of the Great Basin), high altitudes, and the comic theme.  Oh, also, if you want a rising, large body of water near Southern Utah there's always Lake Mead.  But it's probably not so large as to be mistaken for the sea. --Joe Decker

Or be using trebuchets and European castle architecture in sandcastles. And if they genuinely walked for "days" along the shore, it seems unlikely to be a _The Village_ setup; that's got to be 20 miles even taking a leisurely trip for just two days, and probably more. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Tavella (page does not exist)">Tavella</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Tavella (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 23:36, 17 June 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd> Unless Megan and Cueball are kids, that would be an awfully large domestic cat. And from references like the cabin, they are adults or close to it in size.

<p>I'll take a shot... The bottom part is curved and aligns perfectly with Cueball's head in Photoshop, just cutoff on the left (and the right as it goes out of frame). The rounded slice at the top matches Megan's head as well. The full slice does not match any scene to date (the only one close is 1885 with Megan in the tree, but that's not it); thus, it must be a slice from a future scene (or maybe part of a template with assorted characters). <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Galois" title="User:Galois">Galois</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Galois" title="User talk:Galois">talk</a>) 16:20, 21 June 2013 (UTC)

</dd><dd> I think the upper constellation on 2394 is the Sagittarius. The lower one, which can be seen better on 2393 is the tail of the Scorpion constellation. The two bright stars close to each other above the tree are Shaula and Lesath. The brightest star is a planet, probably Venus. The only think bothers me is that there is an other star very close to Ascella in Sagittarius, which should not be there... Maybe an other planet? --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/80.98.250.115" title="Special:Contributions/80.98.250.115">80.98.250.115</a> 21:31, 27 June 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I think you may have it. I passed over Sagittarius at first, because they looked too close together, but I think I was overestimating the scale. Virgo and Gemini both contain something close to the Y pattern of four bright stars, but the surrounding stars aren't right. If it's a planet, it would have to be naked eye visible but not as bright as Ascella,and I don't think there is anything that fits, which is a pity, because we could work out possible years. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Tavella (page does not exist)">Tavella</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Tavella (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 22:26, 27 June 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Reviewing further, I'm even more convinced. If you get a star map in the right orientation, you can see that the rest of Scorpio is becoming visible just above the horizon in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/?frame=2393">Frame 2393</a>.  And the arc of stars the three consellations are 'facing' matches up with the Serpent and Ophiuchius, including the visual binary of Delta and Epsilon Ophiuchi.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Star_Map"> Star Map </span></h2>
<p>Is someone already stitching together a map of the stars as they move through the frames? I could do it, but I'm too lazy *g*.
And if we have that, the relative position of the sun to the stars should be sufficient to determine the day of the year (depending on the accuracy of the drawings) and probably, assuming the first bright dot was indeed Venus, we might even be able to determine if the story takes/took place this year. Maybe other astronomical objects show (or don't show) and help to further narrow down the <b>time</b>. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/92.76.250.121" title="Special:Contributions/92.76.250.121">92.76.250.121</a> 00:18, 28 June 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd>From the position of the sun, Venus is at or close to greatest eastern elongation from the sun.  Assuming that the constellations we are looking at are Sagittarius and surroundings (and the new stars coming into view continue to match this), the sun is located around Virgo.  From the angle of the ecliptic, they are at 30 degrees north, and thus it would have to be around the beginning of November, as that's when Virgo sets with the sun at 30N. So it could be a year when Venus hits the greatest eastern elongation in late October/early November.  Which happens this year, but it can't be this year as the moon isn't right -- there would be a crescent moon next to Venus. It would have to be at new moon or waning moon, and that puts it after 2037. Of course, there are a lot of assumptions and estimations in that calculation. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Tavella (page does not exist)">Tavella</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Tavella (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:29, 28 June 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Actually, for the moon it could be 2029, but there's another blocking factor: Mars should be next to Venus in 2037.  And for the next few eight year cycles, some combination of Mercury, the moon, and Saturn should be showing up between Venus and the Sun before the stars do. So it looks like 2053 would be the first matching date. And the next date after that 2085 - it precesses forward a bit each year, so it would be Nov 12 by 2085. Seems a bit late for grapes and hiking without any thought of shelter, but if it's 30N it is likely a pretty warm area. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Tavella (page does not exist)">Tavella</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Tavella (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:59, 28 June 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Going backwards, the first one with no planets is 1981, but there would be a nearly full moon, and that scene does not look illuminated by a full moon.

<p>I wandered over to the forum, and they agree with our conclusion of Sagittarius, and one of them had a interesting observation: Antares is gone. It should be the brightest thing in this view apart from Venus, and you can see the two stars that should flank it appear at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/?frame=2392">Frame 2392</a>, between Cueball's head and the tree, but no Antares. Which suggests that this is set sufficiently far in the future that Antares has gone supernova (which it is due to do.) <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Tavella (page does not exist)">Tavella</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Tavella (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 06:27, 28 June 2013 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Even more suggestive of a far future: certain of the stars in the Scorpion appear to have moved.  If you go to Hipparchos [<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.rssd.esa.int/SA-general/Projects/Hipparcos/apps/ShowMotion.html">[17]</a>] and enter RA 260.4, Dec -42, and V(lim) 4.4, you will get the stars in the head and part of the body of the Scorpion. If you run it forward several thousand years, you'll see that the high-motion stars match with the distortions in the XKCD sky.<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Tavella (page does not exist)">Tavella</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Tavella (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 08:05, 28 June 2013 (UTC)

<p>One last thing (for the moment): The angle of the sun and planets are what they should be for c. 30-33 degrees N, but to get the constellations angled the right way, it's closer to 12 degrees north. This may be precession, which could also explain the grapes in what would be currently by the stars the beginning of November -- the vernal equinox may have precessed forward, resulting in the sun being in Virgo/Libra in summer rather than fall. 15,000 years would put it in Libra in June, for example <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Tavella (page does not exist)">Tavella</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Tavella (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:27, 28 June 2013 (UTC)

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Where_in_the_world_are_Megan_and_Cueball.3F"> Where in the world are Megan and Cueball? </span></h2>
<p>Venus marking the path of the ecliptic tells us that we are at about 30 degrees north (my quick-ass calculation came up closer to 31 or 32 degrees north.) They are walking east with the ocean to the south of them, and they are following a large river north into hills and mountains that apparently are less than a day's walk north. 
</p><p>So if it's Earth, where could they be? There's not a lot of south-facing coasts around 30N. The only large one is the Gulf Coast of the US, but there's not much in the way of hills much less anything you could call a mountain close to the shore. The only exception I can really see is maybe around Mobile, which at last has some hills. There's the north end of the Persian Gulf and of the Gulf of California, but for both of those the hills are east of of the most obvious large river.  Though the Gulf of California would make sense in other ways -- rivers that only run to the sea in the wet season, for example. There's South Korea, but the southern coast of that is broken up into a fringe of islands and peninsula, there's not really a solid stretch of coast to walk east along.  <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Tavella (page does not exist)">Tavella</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Tavella (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 00:14, 28 June 2013 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>If, as hypothesized above, this is taking place a few thousand years into the future, might not the coastlines have changed?  (Especially since the "sea" seems to be rising.)  I wonder if we could find the proper configuration of hills and a mountain even in absence of a body of water to the south.  <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/69.123.166.176" title="Special:Contributions/69.123.166.176">69.123.166.176</a> 15:06, 28 June 2013 (UTC)

<p>All the stars are following the same parallel path through the sky. Shouldn't the stars should be following a circular path centered on the north star, and the planets if any be following roughly the path of the sun and moon? --deepfatfriar

<dl><dd>Based on my analsys (sicking a post-it to my screen so that it partially obscures Venus) things do seem to be curving (Venus is less obscured, then more, then less as I step through frames). <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/99.72.154.66" title="Special:Contributions/99.72.154.66">99.72.154.66</a> 03:54, 28 June 2013 (UTC)

<p>So, how far away are we viewing them from? We know (about) how tall Cueball is and the stars give us an angular ruler so we should be able to figure that out.

</p><p>Someone mentioned the Clock of the Long Now, and the 10,000 Year Clock would fit in a number of ways.  The Texas original one is at the right latitude, and the Sierra Diablo mountains where it is are near a dried-up inland sea, which presumably could be a sea again, and an inland sea could rise much faster than the world's oceans.  And it would fit with the title "Time", and explain the multi-thousand year future setting. 
</p><p>Has anyone been able to map exactly where the sun is on the stars? That would show where in the precession sequence we are. If it's in Libra, for example 15,000 years forward the sun would set in Libra around June at 31-32 degrees north at that point.

<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://xkcd.mscha.org/#frame2440">mscha's site</a> numbers them 2440a to 2440e.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Uh, it would be great if we could number frames in actual chronological number order, not appending letters onto the ends of the filenames.

<p>Is this pair the Cueball and Meagan we've known from before? What impresses me is the level of ignorance this pair exhibits, compared to the couple we've come to know. This pair do not seem to understand oxygen starvation at higher altitudes, how tides work, etc. This almost flies in contradiction to the fact that, in the beginning, they were building sand castles. This presumes castles existed at some point in their own history if not currently. Castles indicate a certain level of knowledge and technology, which this current couple seem to lack knowledge of, to some large degree at least.
If this strip 'ends' at the level of technology we've seen thus far and hinted at by this new tribe of people, I would suggest this indicates a world wide (or at least very large area) collapse of a prior civilization.

<p>I believe it's possible to translate their language into pervect english by simple replacing their symbols by roman letters (the right way). For "water" we have an example.

<dl><dd>What could the last word in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/?frame=2728">Frame 2728</a> be then? It ends the same way as "water"/"drink", except for a ° instead of a ¯ over the last letter, but has an additional "3"-shaped letter at the beginning. I'm starting to believe that Randall put a bit more effort into designing this language. --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Chtz&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Chtz (page does not exist)">Chtz</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Chtz&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Chtz (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:34, 11 July 2013 (UTC)

<p>It is clearly not a letter-per-letter cipher; I think Randall has been considerably cleverer than that. It looks like a (fictional) Semitic language, in which case individual characters could indicate syllables rather than letters, but I doubt that it is a simple cipher for English at the syllable level either. At this stage it is impossible to say how far he has gone in creating an original syntax, but I would note that we have seen the word that means "water" (or "drink") in at least two forms (a simple form used by Cueball, and a form with a kind of 3 at the beginning used as the last word of the Beanie's response to Cueball's picture). I'm confident the ¯ is simply a period, ° a question mark, and the double ¯ is an exclamation mark. The other stray marks could be other punctuation marks as well. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:KenBrown&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:KenBrown (page does not exist)">KenBrown</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:KenBrown&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:KenBrown (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:55, 11 July 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Provisionally, I took the "water" string with the '3' in front to be something like "sea-water." <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Taibhse&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Taibhse (page does not exist)">Taibhse</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Taibhse&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Taibhse (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 18:25, 11 July 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Another reason why it's not a "letter-per-letter cipher" is that I'm pretty sure we've seen at least 3 distinct single character words.

<p>I just noticed that translator often puts a ° or ¯ above last letter in some sentences, just like in stranglish (did we come up with a better name for it yet?). I think this confirms that ° and ¯ is stranglish punctuation.

<p>I suppose it is safe to assume that the black frame (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/?frame=2698">Frame 2698</a>) represents some indeterminate passage of time, since we do see Cueball now speaking the language of the Beanie-Wearers. What is strange, and perhaps it is just Randall being lazy, is that if you compare the frames before and after the black frame, there is absolutely no changes to vegetation, and very few changes to anything else. Vegetation would have been the biggest culprit to a lengthy time interval. (Again, assuming it took some non-trivial amount of time for Cueball to learn the new language.) --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/68.147.179.172" title="Special:Contributions/68.147.179.172">68.147.179.172</a> 20:01, 10 July 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I assume only a few hours have passed. It seems rather that Cueball is only now learning his first word: "water."

<p>Megan started wearing a backpack after they left the tower. They lost Cueball's backpack when the animal clawed it up, so he carried everything in Megan's to keep weight off her leg. That ointment must be good stuff if she's able to walk with a backpack.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Who_are_they.3F"> Who are they? </span></h2>
<p>If the Great and Powerful OZ steps out from behind a curtain, I'll upchuck. Castles imply a need for defense, yet our adventurous pair and the 'natives' both seem totally relaxed with the discovery of the other. No obvious caution shown, no attempt to discover which side they may be on, etc. In fact, the 'natives' appear to be experienced with the finding of new people and following an established procedure for dealing with them, hence the trip to the castle. If Meagan and Cueball had declined to follow, what would have taken place then? Just a guess but I would say, nothing, each to their separate way.
</p><p>The one map view strongly suggests, to me, survey work using trigonometry (or some variation) to determine location. It would seem to be a case of figure the location first, get there, then see what you find. The greater and lesser circles are intriguing as well, along with the long, straight lines and other geometrical figures seen. Wish there was a bigger, clearer view of it.<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Riprap&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Riprap (page does not exist)">Riprap</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Riprap&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Riprap (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 00:11, 17 July 2013 (UTC)

The usage of merlons indicates that it shall have some defense purpose&#8212;OTOH, it could be purely decorative. The fact that they all seem very relaxed about meeting strangers and nobody (visibly) carries any kind of weapons or armor suggests the latter. --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Chtz&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Chtz (page does not exist)">Chtz</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Chtz&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Chtz (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 07:31, 17 July 2013 (UTC)

<p>They could be adding to an extant structure - historically not an uncommon practice.  So the merlons could be historic.  As a side note, are there levers and pivots in the glass window? Maybe this is the temple of engineering??  ~~rbnm
</p>
<dl><dd>Or just using past motifs.  Look at all the Grecian columns and medieval merlons and gargoyles and what-not that went into subsequent architecture.  Nothing is more full of tradition (right along with innovation) than architecture.  As for the "temple of engineering" it might just be that the whole city is the "Engineers."  (Not Larry Niven's Engineers.)  Whatever their role, they might be causing the sea level to rise through an engineering project, thinking that no one lives down by the sea. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Taibhse&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Taibhse (page does not exist)">Taibhse</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Taibhse&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Taibhse (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:11, 17 July 2013 (UTC)

<p>It's interesting that the castle is mostly underground. I wonder if the "little houses" also extend underground? And I wonder if this is a sign this is a very hot climate for the Beanies / Long-haired woman (I like the idea of naming her Hypatia, as was suggested elsewhere.)  If it's hot for them up on the mountain where it is significantly cooler to Cuegan, maybe that explains why they didn't think there were people down in the sea basin. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Tavella (page does not exist)">Tavella</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Tavella&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Tavella (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 22:55, 17 July 2013 (UTC)
</p><p>Underground, an interesting theory but, many such structures had several levels below ground level, so as to reach the bedrock wherein to support the massive stone structure above. Once dug, why waste it, especially if it provided a comfortable environment? Still, the temperature theory is interesting.

<dl><dd>No, you're not the only one.  Megan reacted that way when Hair Woman asked them for their bags, for example.  Both our protagonists looked uncomfortable when she sent away the three individuals that had helped them and brought them to the castle.  And remember the hill people, and the discussion between M and C of the people on the mountain being -- maybe, hopefully -- different, since they are a long way from the hills.

It's not quite the same configuration as Randall's sea basin, but similar.  The flood has its own wiki page at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanclean_flood">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanclean_flood</a>. I really do not think there is any doubt that Randall's story takes place in a far-future (possibly with liberties taken) Mediterranean Basin, and Hair Woman's castle is the Chateau d'If under restoration.  The original Messinian Salinity Crisis (q.v.) is estimated to have taken a thousand years or so to stabilize once the Gibraltar (and possibly other) passage(s) closed, presumably as a result of tectonic activity under the influence of the two opposing continental plates colliding at the site of the present Mediterranean Sea.  <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Taibhse&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Taibhse (page does not exist)">Taibhse</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Taibhse&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Taibhse (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 05:45, 21 July 2013 (UTC)
</p><p>I do believe it quite likely that Hair Woman's people's ancestors/forbears already were spread as far west as Gibraltar, which would explain why her people know about the Atlantic seeping in, and then flowing, through the barrier.

<dl><dd>Great work!  Are the white spaces just regions lacking bathymetric data?  My speculation is that the "40" will already be on the move.  The original "sand" castle (as much salt as sand?  It certainly was a sculptable medium anyway) was implied to be underwater in the three frames with the rocking bucket on the waves.  Beret Girl was down there just as C+M were leaving, dragging something.  They will not have been caught totally by surprise.  Perhaps the C+M's upper "castle" construction will end up being a raft?  Or perhaps they have packed up their tents and are already heading for high ground?  They might have seen the Hill People leaving, or...who knows.  We still have to "wait for it" even as C+M "run."

<p>Cueball is concerned that the water is fresh.  Although this may seem to disprove the theory that the Atlantic is flooding into the Mediterranean, it actually doesn't. Notice that Cueball "felt" that something was strange.  What was strange was that they were accustomed to an extremely salty sea. Can you imagine filling up the Mediterranean Sea with ocean water then cutting it off from the Atlantic and allowing it to evaporate down to the size of C&amp;M's sea?  It would be extremely salty and you could float easily in it. The water from the Atlantic Ocean is nowhere near that salty so Cueball interprets it as fresh water. This will cause problems with the rescue because these people are not used to swimming in water that's not super salty.  They can't float like they're used to and risk drowning. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/198.103.184.76" title="Special:Contributions/198.103.184.76">198.103.184.76</a> 16:32, 23 July 2013 (UTC)dbuck

<dl><dd>My thought too. He does say "Not as fresh as a river", which means it's still salty, but much less so than the sea they're used to. I'm reminded of the Dead Sea, which also has a very high salinity. This makes the water tasting and spluttering in the beginning (while building the sand castle) make a lot of sense. I guess I have to go back and read it all again now that we have some context.  ~Therrufying <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/83.233.5.126" title="Special:Contributions/83.233.5.126">83.233.5.126</a> 18:36, 23 July 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Well, I sure couldn't see the writing on the wall when he started to rush the story - I mean, he depicted the climb from the point where they meet the tribe (which is shortly before the dunes) to the castle in about 1500 frames - more than a month worth of story, I think - while the descent was depicted in just about 100 frames. So, when he started to rush things, my reaction was thinking that something big was about to happen; and I think that's why I (and others here) are disappointed at how it ended. I suppose Randall started to get tired and just wanted to be done with it, but maybe he could've wrapped it up a bit better. He made an awesome job on the whole, yeah, but I do get that "Lost" feeling - anticlimatic, and a few things left unexplained. --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Fernandofig&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Fernandofig (page does not exist)">Fernandofig</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Fernandofig&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Fernandofig (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:46, 27 July 2013 (UTC)

<p>I wish there WERE credits. I would love to get Randall's view on what his original idea was, whether he fashioned the whole story from the beginning or if it started simple and evolved into this post-apocalyptic drama, what his inspirations were, what real-wold sources he used to develop the science, a language translation, etc. I loved the whole series and checked daily (mostly) and don't think the ending in any way diminished the richness of the whole. As usually happens with XKCD, it spawned some wonderful discussions, speculations and scientific explorations. We don't usually get much explanation and I don't anticipate much from this one, either, but it doesn't make me long for it (or am I missing something). Thank you for the wonderful four month exercise in patience. Every time XKCD does something amazing that I think cannot be topped, Randall always comes up with something that amazes me. What's next? I guess I have to, "Wait for it."--<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Gerry&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Gerry (page does not exist)">Gerry</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Gerry&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Gerry (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:47, 28 July 2013 (UTC)
