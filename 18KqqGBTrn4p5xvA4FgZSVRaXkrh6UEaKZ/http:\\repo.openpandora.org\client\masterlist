It is not another wrapper built on Linux, like WINE. It does not attempt or plan to compete with WINE; in fact, the user-mode part of ReactOS is almost entirely WINE-based and our two teams have cooperated closely in the past. ReactOS is also not \"yet another OS\". It does not attempt to be a third player, like SkyOS or any other alternative OS out there. People are not meant to uninstall Linux and use ReactOS instead; ReactOS is a replacement for Windows users who want a Windows replacement that behaves just like Windows.\n\nWhile ReactOS' source availability and current usage is mostly intended for programmers to expand and improve on, you don't need to be a rocket scientist to use it, and in its final state will be a consumer friendly OS. If you've used Windows before, you'll find yourself in a familiar environment with ReactOS. The learning curve, if any, should be minimal, since ReactOS duplicates many of the Windows graphical environment applets, control panels and dialogs (Windows 2000/XP/2003).\n\nFocus at present is on developing ReactOS to a stage where it is capable of running most Windows drivers and applications \"out of the box.\" This does not mean that ReactOS will stop there, however; as new features are added to Windows, our developers be striving to incorporate such new features in future versions of ReactOS. Once the compatibility level has been reached, we may even choose to improve ReactOS beyond its Windows roots. These changes would be external from the main OS, and totally compatible with Windows, but they would add an extra advantage. For example, one of our goals is to have built-in POSIX compatibility, much like Windows Services for Unix. It could also be as simple as natively supporting multiple desktops however, instead of requiring a powertoy.\n\nReactOS\u00ae is a registered trademark of the ReactOS Foundation.\nWindows\u00ae NT\u2122 is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation."}},"info":"ReactOS using qemu.

Some features are borrowed from classics like the Atari coin-ups Asteroids and Gravitar, and the home-computer games Thrust (Commodore 64) and Gravity Force (Commodore Amiga), but XPilot has many new aspects too. Highlights include:\n\n- True client/server based game; optimal speed for every player.\n- Meta server with up to date information about servers hosting games around the world.\n- A web of world-wide rating servers; compare your skills with pilots from all around the world, and climb the ladder of the world-wide rating list.\n- 'Real physics'; particles of explosions and sparks from your engines all affect you if you're hit by them. This makes it possible to kill someone by blowing them into a wall with engine thrust or shock waves from explosions.\n- Specialized editors for editing ship-shapes and maps.\n- Game objective and gameplay adjustable through a number of options, specified on the commandline, in special option files, or in the map files.

Some features are borrowed from classics like the Atari coin-ups Asteroids and Gravitar, and the home-computer games Thrust (Commodore 64) and Gravity Force (Commodore Amiga), but XPilot has many new aspects too. Highlights include:\n\n- True client/server based game; optimal speed for every player.\n- Meta server with up to date information about servers hosting games around the world.\n- A web of world-wide rating servers; compare your skills with pilots from all around the world, and climb the ladder of the world-wide rating list.\n- 'Real physics'; particles of explosions and sparks from your engines all affect you if you're hit by them. This makes it possible to kill someone by blowing them into a wall with engine thrust or shock waves from explosions.\n- Specialized editors for editing ship-shapes and maps.\n- Game objective and gameplay adjustable through a number of options, specified on the commandline, in special option files, or in the map files.

This is a great game (I played long hours on it) but sadly it isn't available under Linux since it was developped by commercial company. Sources from the orginal games aren't available. FreeSiege will strive to become a great reimplementation of a great game.\n\nGame experience should provide a intense 2D tetris-like war game experience with a strategic game flavour. It allows one player vs computer and two players games. The interface can be split into two part:\n\nThe upper part of the screen is the board itself. It is divided in two 5 by 6 grids of tokens called elements (one for each player / computer). Elements can be of any of the four Elemental types (Defense, Attack, Fire and Magic). The player controls a cursor using keyboard arrows which allow the player to swap to elements on the grid. Swapping elements is an important part of the game since it is the way to create patterns to create fighting units in the lower part (ie. two neighboring attack tokens create a soldier, a big combinaison using fire and magic creates a dragon, ...). The bigger the combinaison are, the more powerful the created units are.\nThe lower part of the screen is the strategic part. Two castles, representing the players, are disposed at the left and right of the screen. Units created by combinations spawn at the player's castle and start to rush towards the ennemy castle. When they meet other units on their way they fight each other using a simple health-attack-defense scheme. If a unit manage to reach the oppenent castle, it heavily damages to it. The first player to devastate his opponent's castle wins the game. This part of the game is quite strategic because each kind of unit has it own particularity. For example, when a simple soldier, fast to create, but with low health and medium defense/attack, fight a big, slow and difficult to create unit (eg. dragon or golem) or a ranged unit, the end is quite predictable. But since the soldier is very fast to create, you can create a big bunch of those to fight a big unit, making the outcome of the fight uncertain. The combinaisons and units are very well balanced, making the game very intense and struggling. \n\nFreesiege intents to provide an intense strategic-board game experience."}},"info":"Here is FreeSiege, an opensource clone of Siege.\r\n\r\nThe game feature a \"Survival mode\" for a 1 player game, but it's more oriented for 2 player, so the I fixed a keymap oriented for 2 player.

Change view to inside view with no cockpit also for a bit better framerate (with 'F2' 3 or 4 times...).\r\n5. There are some precision texture bugs clearly visible, but fixing that seems difficult, has it has to be done globaly for all texture coord of the landscape.\r\n6.

It's been in test among a small group of players for about a month now; it seems time to open it up and see what others think.\nIn short, one of the purposes of this fork is to try to make the game more interesting for experienced/skilled players, while making it no harder (or, in a couple cases, slightly easier) for the newbie. It's also going to be an attempt to try to increase variety in the standard 'ascension kit', since right now it is pretty well defined.\nThere is a server available for play at this telnet link; the very rough changelog and description can be seen at this webpage. A patch to match the server state will eventually be published on the website as well, once I confirm that the patches will properly apply to a vanilla 3.4.3 distribution.\nThere is a channel #sporkhack on irc.freenode.net where discussions take place relatively frequently; there is a bot there, much like #nethack's Rodney, who will announce deaths and ascensions as they occur.\nPlease keep in mind that these changes should be considered to be alpha- or beta- level; there may well be bugs, and these bugs may affect your gameplay. I do try to fix bugs found as rapidly as possible, but I can't always update the server immediately since I have others' games to consider as well, especially if I have a patch in the queue that will break savefile compatibility.\nThis is a live fork! For the near future, I will still be making a great deal of changes, and if an imbalance is found with existing changes, they are not set in stone -- if something is too hard, I will certainly consider toning it down to a more reasonable level. By the same token, if something I add makes things too easy, I will probably tone _that_ down too.\nI hope you enjoy it.\""}},"info":"Forum Discussion\r\nhttp://boards.openpandora.org/topic/15949-sporkhack/\r\n\r\nLatest Update\r\n- added an xmodmap so that d-pad can be used for movement keys.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues","size":2022028,"md5":"75b52fc07acf62915841929240174cd4","modified-time":1395332971,"author":{"name":"port by NearTao","website":"http://www.sporkhack.com/"},"vendor":"neartao","icon":"http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/sporkhack/icon.png","redistributable":1,"previewpics":["http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/sporkhack/media/screenshot.png"],"licenses":"","source":"","categories":["Game","RolePlaying"],"commercial":0},{"id":"ravage-sdl","uri":"http://repo.openpandora.org/client/download?id=ravage-sdl","version":{"major":"0","minor":"1","release":"0","build":"02","type":"release"},"localizations":{"en_US":{"title":"Ravage","description":"Ravage is a vertically scrolling top down shooter which was originally released\n\tas shareware in 1996.

Once you have programmed the wakeup time, you can put your Pandora into sleep mode, and it will automatically power on to wake you up. In order to have the actual alarm signal (a media file of your choice), you need to have mplayer on your system which I believe is installed with the community codec pack.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have tried to implement a reasonably friendly interface, there are no plans to burden this app with features. Instead, I hope to see wake-up from sleep mode in other clock apps, notably PandoraClock.\r\n\r\nAlarm date and time is accepted in the format of 'date' utility. It's pretty intuitive, but you might want to check out 'man date' in case of issues. The only change I have made is when you provide only hours, minutes (and seconds). In this case, the alarm is always set in the future, today or tomorow. For example, if you set the alarm to \"6:00\" at noon, it will be set to next morning. The alarm set to \"14:00\" will ring in two hours.\r\n\r\nIt is now possible to use Wakeup alarm without entering the password every time.

It's made by the same team that brought you Battle for Wesnoth, and features the same handcrafted love of high-end pixel art.  Frogatto is a side-on \"platformer\" or \"jump and run\" game, where you lead our titular character on a humdrum errand that turns into a daring adventure.\n\nFrogatto's key mechanic is an unusual twist; like any frog, he jumps, swims, and snags bugs with his tongue, but unlike any frog before him, can spit those bugs out with deadly force.  Not merely an action game, frogatto is a full, classic adventure game, with characters to talk to, things to buy, puzzles to solve, and a wide, complex world to explore.\n\nFeatures:\n- grab enemies with your tongue and spit them to deal damage\n- buy powerups to enhance and unlock new abilities\n- arcade mode, giving instant access to action-only gameplay on randomized levels\n- forgiving savegame/respawn system so you don't have to be afraid of losing progress\n- playful dialogue writing that tries not to insult your intelligence\n- massive soundtrack with over an hour of original music\n- sprawling, complex world with over 70 levels to explore, and tons of secrets to find\n- OpenFeint and Achievement support\n\nTo find out more about the game please visit http://www.frogatto.com/\n\nReviews:\n- [3/4 SlideToPlay.com] \"a fun and surprisingly deep platformer\"\n- [4/5 AppSpy.com] \"boy-howdy is this an amazing visual feast!\"\n- [n/a TouchArcade.com] \"totally worth checking out.\""}},"info":"For more information about this version/port, please visit the forum thread:\r\nhttp://www.gp32x.com/board/index.php?/topic/58558-frogatto-and-friends/page__view__findpost__p__949131\r\n\r\nChangelog 1.3.3.1:\r\n* Bumpted to latest 1.3 upstream stable series.\r\n* Deactivated Coin Race since it creates problems.\r\n* Removed language selection script, this can now be done ingame after hitting \"fn+q\" (aka \"esc\")\r\n* Please remove your old saves and config files (best: complete frogatto/ folder in appdata/), otherwise you might experience \"interesting\" behaviour and at least wrong button mapping.\r\n\r\nChangelog 1.2.0.1:\r\n* Bumpted to latest 1.2 upstream release.\r\n\r\nChangelog 1.1.1.1:\r\n* Bumpted to latest 1.1.1 upstream release.\r\n\r\nChangelog 1.1.0.2:\r\n* Fixed crash when dying.\r\n\r\nChangelog 1.1.0.1:\r\n* Bumpted to latest 1.1 upstream release.\r\n* Added a script allowing selection of the language to use ingame.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n* When zooming in/out due to dialogs, edges of textures flicker.\r\n* Every now and then the pandora might hardfreeze (bad 3D driver!).

I hope Courserian can become your daily companion to learn more stuff, everywhere, every day.\n\nCourserian is a candidate for the Alive And Kicking Coding Competition. \n\nTo use Courserian, you need to have completed these steps:\n- to have registered an account on Coursera.org (free to create)\n- to have registered to follow at least one course\n- to have at least one course which has started (and not closed yet)\n- to have accepted the code of Honor for that course\n\nOnce you are done, \n1) Launch Courserian from the Education menu in xfce\n2) Enter your Login Details (login and password from Coursera.org) - only the first time.\n3) Add a course to follow: check the URL of your course in your course page (for example, https://class.coursera.org/powerofmarkets-001) and insert the name after class.coursera.org/, i.e. powerofmarkets-001 in this example. \n4) Decide to download the course material immediately or not\n5) Once you have downloaded some material, you can browse the material through Courserian\n6) Courserian will open txt, srt, pdf, and video files for you. (word, excel and ppt files are not yet supported)\n7) Coursera updates courses material every week, so you can run a \"Course update\" every week to get the latest course material with Courserian. \n\nAdditional Features:\n- You can delete courses from Courserian once you are done with them, to save space. \n- You can go in the Extras Menu and ask to use SMPlayer (if you have it installed on your SD Card) to view videos (since the Mplayer in the firmware is not working well enough for some videos)\n- to do: install SMPlayer from extras.\n- to do: email notification from extras\n\nVersion 0.4 (7 Feb 2014) - Now displaying sizes of lessons folders + Working Download/Update All Courses option (please test) + a few fixes.\nVersion 0.3 - Added features (SMPlayer loaded by default always after you set it up once, Column to track which videos you have viewed so far) and another bug fix. \nVersion 0.2 - Added features (file size of course display, show videos only button, background download by default) and various fixes.\nVersion 0.1 - Initial Release - Tested only on 1.60 Firmware so far. \n\nTools used: \nYad (front-end), Coursera-dl (backend), ImageJ (logo).\nAll work done entirely on Pandora with Geany."}},"size":3694006,"md5":"be493b96d6ce23950a0d928002540691","modified-time":1391785096,"author":{"name":"Ekianjo","website":"https://github.com/ekianjo/Courserian"},"vendor":"ekianjo","icon":"http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/courserian/icon.png","redistributable":1,"previewpics":["http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/courserian/screens/01.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/courserian/screens/02.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/courserian/screens/03.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/courserian/screens/04.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/courserian/screens/05.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/courserian/screens/06.png"],"licenses":"","source":"","categories":["Education"],"commercial":0},{"id":"windowsrg.dimag0g","uri":"http://repo.openpandora.org/client/download?id=windowsrg.dimag0g","version":{"major":"1","minor":"0","release":"0","build":"0","type":"alpha"},"localizations":{"en_US":{"title":"Windows RG","description":"A small Windows package running fullscreen.

Several ships enter those portals, but one does not return.\nThe game features stunning real-time in-nebula missions with sensor interference and electrical storms; ship battles that include new beam weapons and antifighter flak cannons; 12 new ship classes, including the Corvette-class capital ships; two single-player missions, plus one training mission; two multiplayer missions, including the new 12-player Dogfight mode."}},"info":"There are some glitches in some menu (mainly on Yes/No confirmation dialog).

Have fun !\n\n\nEntry for the Alive & Kicking Coding Competition 2013/2014.\n\n(The source code is inside the PND.)"}},"info":"Forum topic:\r\nhttp://boards.openpandora.org/topic/15290-roswyn-the-dragons-new-ported-game/\r\n\r\nMovement: DPAD\r\nAction: [A][B][X][Y]\r\nPause: [Enter]\r\nQuit: [ESC]","size":15531123,"md5":"57ac809fe024ff32a8fa199e517f1dbd","modified-time":1388604794,"author":{"name":"M-HT","website":"https://github.com/makrohn/polymorphable"},"vendor":"M-HT","icon":"http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/roswyn_m-ht/icon.png","redistributable":1,"previewpics":["http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/roswyn_m-ht/roswyn-1.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/roswyn_m-ht/roswyn-2.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/roswyn_m-ht/roswyn-3.png"],"licenses":["Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 (C"],"source":"","categories":["Game","ActionGame"],"commercial":0},{"id":"alxm.trap75","uri":"http://repo.openpandora.org/client/download?id=alxm.trap75","version":{"major":"2","minor":"2","release":"0","build":"0","type":"release"},"localizations":{"en_US":{"title":"Trap75","description":"Trap75 is a game like Jezzball, where you need to cover 75% of each level's space without getting your lines hit by the moving balls.

After that and some additional bugfixing, I noticed that tamentis was looking for a new maintainer, so I offered my help along with a bunch of patches and got the position.\n\nDGen isn't the best Mega Drive/Genesis emulator out there, but it works and it's probably the most portable. \n\n----\n\n29th July: Build 2 with custom key mappings:\nA, X, B = A, B, C on Megadrive/Genesis\nStart = Start\nSelect = Mode\n1,2,3 .... 9 are the slots for quick saves.

XEPhem behaves well on the Opean Pandora screen since its windows are fully re-sizeable and are broken into functionality groups (you don't just get one huge, visually confusing window).\n\nAlthough I have removed a graphic image that caused the initial window to be bigger than the OP screen, you may still need to set your taskbar to autohide for the main window to display properly.\n\nI have included a copy of the XEphem manual in the Documentation directory off the root of the pnd.\n\nVisit the Clear Skies Institute web site for further details of what this very capable piece of software can do, and seriously consider buying a copy of the commercial version! The author and other users are VERY responsive in terms of providing help and assistance and incorporating functionality suggestions into future versions."}},"size":43972786,"md5":"e6aab48ae737fbee7ddb088c1e0ef254","modified-time":1375004236,"author":{"name":"MarkW","website":"http://www.clearskyinstitute.com/xephem"},"vendor":"MarkW","icon":"http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/markw23/icon.png","redistributable":1,"previewpics":["http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/markw23/screens/xephem-a.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/markw23/screens/xephem-b.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/markw23/screens/xephem-c.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/markw23/screens/xephem-d.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/markw23/screens/xephem-e.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/markw23/screens/xephem-f.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/markw23/screens/xephem-g.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/markw23/screens/xephem-h.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/markw23/screens/xephem-i.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/markw23/screens/xephem-j.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/markw23/screens/xephem-k.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/markw23/screens/xephem-l.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/markw23/screens/xephem-m.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/markw23/screens/xephem-n.png"],"licenses":["Custom license"],"source":["http://www.clearskyinstitute.com/xephem"],"categories":["Education","Astronomy"],"commercial":0},{"id":"markw20","uri":"http://repo.openpandora.org/client/download?id=markw20","version":{"major":"2","minor":"0","release":"2","build":"1","type":"release"},"localizations":{"en_US":{"title":"Lyx","description":"LyX is called a \"document processor\", because unlike standard word processors, LyX encourages an approach to writing based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance.

It is multithreaded, so time-consuming operations such as image file reading can be performed in parallel with other operations.\n\nIt can calculate area and pixel value statistics of user-defined selections. It can measure distances and angles. It can create density histograms and line profile plots. It supports standard image processing functions such as contrast manipulation, sharpening, smoothing, edge detection and median filtering.\n\nIt does geometric transformations such as scaling, rotation and flips. Image can be zoomed up to 32:1 and down to 1:32. All analysis and processing functions are available at any magnification factor. The program supports any number of windows (images) simultaneously, limited only by available memory.\n\nSpatial calibration is available to provide real world dimensional measurements in units such as millimeters. Density or gray scale calibration is also available.\n\nImageJ was designed with an open architecture that provides extensibility via Java plugins.

When you surround a group of one color with another color, the surrounded group clears, scoring points. The surrounding tiles flip to the color of the tiles that were cleared. When tiles flip color, chain reactions are possible. Larger groups and longer chain reactions are awarded more points.\n\nAs the game progresses, more colors are added to the pool, making the grid more and more constrained. Pressure builds until the grid finally fills up, and the game ends.\nDespite this mounting pressure, the game doesn't have a frantic feel, because you have as much time as you want to make each move. Whereas games like Tetris depend on getting faster and faster to be challenging, Primrose derives deep challenge from inherent properties of its mechanics.\nBut comparisons with Tetris aren't very helpful, because Primrose does not have you dropping tiles down a well. Primrose also doesn't have you swapping adjacent tiles like so many match-3 games. So what comparison is useful? Primrose is a small bit like Go and Othello (if either of those were one-player games), a small bit like Lights Out, and a big bit like nothing you've every played before.\n\n\nPrimrose includes the following features:\nLive, networked high score boards.

Collect computer chips, avoid monsters push blocks, and solve puzzles to get to the end and continue to the next level.\n\nTile World 2 is an updated version of Tile World created by Madhav Shanbhag which includes an improved interface.\n\nTile World can emulate two different rulesets. The Lynx ruleset is from the original Atari Lynx game, and the MS ruleset which is from the Microsoft port of Chips Challenge to Windows.\n\nThe graphics included in Tile world take up most of the vertical screen space pushing some UI elements offscreen so I have included a Graphics set created by me which is a recreation of the graphics from the MS version of the game. However this only works on the MS ruleset, for the Lynx ruleset the included graphics are the only ones available.\n\nThe full release of my tileset including licence info is here http://cczone.invisionzone.com/index.php?/files/file/238-felix-challenge/\n\nI have also included the 2 official fan made levelsets CCLP2 and CCLP3. CCLP2 can only be played in MS mode. The original levelset is not included but if you can play it if you have a copy. \n\nP.S. The Chips Challenge community at cczone.invisionzone.com is in the process of createing a new official levelset called CCLP1 oriented toward newer players (CCLP2 and CCLP3 are very hard). You can help with the voting by downloading voting packs and playing them.\n\nKnown issues:\nAt the start of a level the direction keys will sometimes act as if they're stuck pushing them will fix this. This is an issue with all linux versions of Tile World 2.\nThe included graphics (not my tileset) are too big for the interface to fit the pandora's screen.\nIn Tile World 2 there is no way to see the password of a level, this is, however not needed in normal play as the game saves which levels you have comepleted."}},"size":1347268,"md5":"d05c569fd82baaa5e3922f44bd3ce654","modified-time":1371763082,"author":{"name":"ported by Felix20","website":"http://www.openpandora.org/"},"vendor":"felix20","icon":"http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/tworld2-felix20-01/icon.png","redistributable":1,"previewpics":["http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/tworld2-felix20-01/previews/Img1.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/tworld2-felix20-01/previews/Img2.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/tworld2-felix20-01/previews/Img3.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/tworld2-felix20-01/previews/Img4.png"],"licenses":["GPLv2"],"source":"","categories":["Game","LogicGame","ActionGame"],"commercial":0},{"id":"sabnzbd.wb","uri":"http://repo.openpandora.org/client/download?id=sabnzbd.wb","version":{"major":"0","minor":"7","release":"13","build":"1","type":"release"},"localizations":{"en_US":{"title":"SABnzbd","description":"SABnzbd is an open-source cross-platform binary newsreader.\nIt simplifies the process of downloading from Usenet dramatically,\nthanks to its friendly web-based user interface and advanced\nbuilt-in post-processing options that automatically verify, repair,\nextract and clean up posts downloaded from Usenet.\nSABnzbd also has a fully customizable user interface,\nand offers a complete API for third-party applications to hook into.\n\nThere is an extensive Wiki on the use of SABnzbd.\nhttp://wiki.sabnzbd.org/"}},"size":3345151,"md5":"34b1879da65e609fe4bc7ad26b0b105c","modified-time":1371645516,"author":{"name":"Jon Sneyers","website":"http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jon.sneyers"},"vendor":"_wb_","icon":"http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/sabnzbd.wb/icon.png","redistributable":1,"previewpics":["http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/sabnzbd.wb/screenshot.png"],"licenses":["GPLv2"],"source":["http://www.sabnzbd.org"],"categories":["Network"],"commercial":0},{"id":"Exobius0-PXML.xml-31589","uri":"http://repo.openpandora.org/client/download?id=Exobius0-PXML.xml-31589","version":{"major":"0","minor":"3","release":"0","build":"01","type":"release"},"localizations":{"en_US":{"title":"Exobius0","description":"Exobius 0\nIt's a hard game.\n\nA SOUND IS ADDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n(B): continus fire\n(X): stop fire\n(Y)/Space: fire (no continus)\np/P: paused\nESC: quit (if game, main menu)."}},"info":"http://boards.openpandora.org/index.php/topic/13517-exobius-0/\r\n\r\nThis is a reflexion game, rather difficult. \r\n\r\n\r\nwebsite: http://exobius0.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\nHistory log:\r\n=========\r\nv0.3.0 : build 01:\r\n * Initial release.","size":16444715,"md5":"09a9750846499fbdf30aed3b50a01aef","modified-time":1371637213,"author":{"name":"Loic2003","website":"http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jon.sneyers"},"vendor":"Loic2003","icon":"http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/Exobius0-PXML.xml-31589/icon.png","redistributable":1,"previewpics":["http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/Exobius0-PXML.xml-31589/previews/preview1.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/Exobius0-PXML.xml-31589/previews/preview2.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/Exobius0-PXML.xml-31589/previews/preview3.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/Exobius0-PXML.xml-31589/previews/preview4.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/Exobius0-PXML.xml-31589/previews/preview6.png"],"licenses":"","source":"","categories":["Game","ArcadeGame"],"commercial":0},{"id":"package.super_hexagon.apkenv","uri":"http://repo.openpandora.org/client/download?id=package.super_hexagon.apkenv","version":{"major":"1","minor":"0","release":"3","build":"2","type":"release"},"localizations":{"en_US":{"title":"Super Hexagon","description":"Super Hexagon is a minimal action game by Terry Cavanagh, with music by Chipzel.\n\nThis is actually using apkenv and is the same as playing it through apkenv itself, except that this version also has C4A leaderboards support.

This gives you (the\ndesigner) full control over the modeling process and enables you to easily\nchange any step in the modeling process or make designs that are defined by\nconfigurable parameters.\n\nOpenSCAD provides two main modeling techniques: First there is constructive\nsolid geometry (aka CSG) and second there is extrusion of 2D outlines. As data\nexchange format format for this 2D outlines Autocad DXF files are used. In\naddition to 2D paths for extrusion it is also possible to read design parameters\nfrom DXF files.

Gameplay is a bit easier. Games are very similar.\n\nTry to keep your VIP (the guy in white) alive as long as possible. The assassins will all try to shoot or stab him to death. You must do all you can to prevent this. Your reputation has preceded you, so the VIP has absolute confidence in your abilities and will completely ignore all the assassins. When an assassin is aiming at your VIP with a gun, you will psychicly see a line of sight extending from him to your VIP. This line will narrow and redden until it disappears and the assassin fires. Depending on the situation it may be best just to shoot the assassin(s), or to dive and tackle the VIP to the ground to avoid the bullet. Unfortunately your psychic powers do not show the line of sight of knife-wielding assassins.\n\nIf you are feeling overwhelmed you can use psychic aiming to temporarily speed up your thought processes and aim your shots better. If there are no visible enemies you may want to release your soul and look for nearby enemies. When your soul is released your VIP pulsates between blue and red, civilians between black and red, and assassins are solid red.\n\nIf you die or your VIP is killed.. the level restarts. If you are are interested in the theory behind this: you are a psychic bodyguard, so you can see small distances into the future. The failure only occured in a possible future which you are now going to try and avoid.\n\nThe scoring system consists of: \n150 points for a successful disarm\n300 points for destroying a zombie (by blowing its head off)\n100+50x points for completing a mission where x is the mission number (i.e. 450 points for completing mission 3)\n75 points for incapacitating an assassin\n     +50 if he had a knife\n-300 points for hurting a civilian\n-200 points for allowing the VIP to die\nThe penalty for failing to protect the VIP is halved if you kill the assassin.\n\nControls:\nWASD / DPad = walk\nshift / {L-Trigger} = run\nmouse / {R-Nub} = look\ncontrol / , = crouch/zoom\nclick / {R-Trigger} = fire (while aiming) or smash (while running) or pick up gun (while crouching over a body and not aiming) or disarm (while not aiming)\nq / {Y} = aim or un-aim (important for picking up guns)\nr / {A} = reload\ne / {B} = psychic aim\nz / {X} = toggle soul release\nspace = dive (while running forwards)\nl    = lasersight"}},"info":"This is a great little FPS.\r\nIt use OpenGLES acceleration, framerate are good, even on CC.\r\nControls are customized to fit the Pandora Controls.\r\nIn appdata/blackshades/home you'll find a config.txt where you can alter some parameters, like the mouse sensitivty if you find it too slow.\r\n\r\nControls are \"FPS\", so Mouse Move is fixed to Right Nubs, and Mouse Button to Left Nubs.\r\nTouchscreen cannot be used (because mouse is Grabbed).\r\n\r\nHistory log\r\n========\r\nBuild 02\r\n----------\r\n * Fixed the freeze that was happening (it was SDL Grabbed Mouse + GLES)\r\n * Added Black Shades Elite, a fork of Black Shades (very similar gameplay and functions).\r\n\r\nBuild 01\r\n----------\r\n * Initial release.\r\n * Ported OpenGL -> OpenGLES1\r\n * Customized controls\r\n\r\nA thread is open here: http://boards.openpandora.org/index.php/topic/13351-black-shades/","size":4195319,"md5":"21a6ccd4eaadea86a03721cdd1046aae","modified-time":1370274670,"author":{"name":"ptitSeb","website":"http://www.icculus.org/blackshades/"},"vendor":"ptitSeb","icon":"http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/blackshades-ptitseb/icon.png","redistributable":1,"previewpics":["http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/blackshades-ptitseb/previews/preview1.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/blackshades-ptitseb/previews/preview2.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/blackshades-ptitseb/previews/preview3.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/blackshades-ptitseb/previews/preview4.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/blackshades-ptitseb/previews/previewA.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/blackshades-ptitseb/previews/previewB.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/blackshades-ptitseb/previews/previewC.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/blackshades-ptitseb/previews/previewD.png","http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/blackshades-ptitseb/previews/previewE.png"],"licenses":"","source":"","categories":["Game"],"commercial":0},{"id":"retroarch.lifning.001","uri":"http://repo.openpandora.org/client/download?id=retroarch.lifning.001","version":{"major":"0","minor":"9","release":"9","build":"1","type":"beta"},"localizations":{"en_US":{"title":"RetroArch","description":"RetroArch is a modular multi-system emulator system that is designed to be fast, lightweight, and portable."}},"info":"RetroArch is a modular, multi-platform, multi-system emulator.\r\n\r\nMajor changes in 0.9.8 -> 0.9.9:\r\n- Replaced Zenity launcher script with PickleLauncher\r\n- New default settings, including using GLES video driver by default\r\n- \"RGUI\" in-game menu, brought up with spacebar by default\r\nYou may need to delete (or move to a backup location) /pandora/appdata/retroarch for the new defaults to take effect.\r\n\r\nList of included libretro cores:\r\nNES: FCEU, Nestopia, QuickNES\r\nSNES: PocketSNES, SNES9x-Next, Mednafen\r\nGBC: Gambatte, TGB Dual\r\nGBA: VBA, Meteor, Mednafen\r\nGenesis / Sega CD: Genesis Plus, Picodrive (experimental)\r\nSaturn: Yabause (Very slow!)\r\nPlaystation: PCSX-ReARMed, Mednafen\r\nAtari 2600: Stella\r\nChip8/16: Maxe\r\nArcade: iMAME4all, Final Burn Alpha\r\nVirtualBoy: Mednafen\r\nNeo Geo Pocket: Mednafen\r\nPC Engine: Mednafen\r\nWonderSwan: Mednafen\r\nCave Story: NXEngine\r\nDoom: PrBoom\r\nQuake: TyrQuake\r\nPC: DosBox\r\nSCUMM: ScummVM\r\nMisc: ModelViewer+SceneWalker (load OBJ 3D models), libretro-2-joy (uinput virtual gamepad)\r\n\r\nAlso includes RetroArch-Phoenix configuration/launcher GUI (GTK+2 based).\r\nAll the cores and RetroArch itself are all the latest git revisions as of the date posted.

It is a fork of http://www.pysol.org/ and distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (while other bundled components have their own license terms).\n\nIts features include modern look and feel (uses Tile widget set), multiple cardsets and tableau backgrounds, sound, unlimited undo, player statistics, a hint system, demo games, a solitaire wizard, support for user written plug-ins, an integrated HTML help browser, and lots of documentation.\n\nThere are games that use the 52 card International Pattern deck, games for the 78 card Tarock deck, eight and ten suit Ganjifa games, Hanafuda games, Matrix games, Mahjongg games, and games for an original hexadecimal-based deck.\n\nThis PND bundles both the python application and the cardsets hosted at http://pysolfc.sf.net/ with Python 2.6.8, pygame 1.9.1, the Python Imaging Library 1.1.7, and Tcl/Tk 8.5.14 for the Pandora. It is playable using either touch screen or nubs. Note that right and middle button clicks have useful (though not neccessary) bindings. There are also different mouse options ingame. You may want to use a suitable cardset (Ctrl-e, Ctrl-+, and Ctrl--), disable the tool and status bars, or use the window managers fullscreen mode to fit the game on screen. Card resizing takes several seconds (depending on clock speed, of course), but the result looks quite good. Note that it is possibe to have different x/y scaling using the 'load cardset' function (Ctrl-e).\n\nMusic is not included, but any files supported by pygame (ogg, mp3, and tracker formats should work) can be dropped into $APPDATADIR/music. Higher clock speed helps to prevent skipping; 800Mhz seems to work fine, YMMV. Ctrl-u skips to the next track. Original PySol music can be downloaded from ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/linux/games/solitaires/pysol-music-4.40.tar.gz\n\nThe package does not (yet) contain the solver.\n\nBuild 2 (2013-05-19): Added neccessary components to enable ttk and card resizing. Included localizations (de, it, pl, ru). No changes to the game itself. Even larger PND size and slower startup, because the full python build is included:-(\n\nStarting from build 2 the PND contains a .PySolFC->. symlink. Old appdata dirs with .PySolFc should still work, but should be manually upgraded by moving the contents of .PySolFC one level up and deleting .PySolFc.\n\nBuild 1 (2013-05-05): Bundled current SVN (1065 games) with Flower Clock changes and PySolFC-Cardsets v2.0 (153 cardsets) with (hopefully) fixed hanafuda ranks.
