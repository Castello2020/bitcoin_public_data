<p>If any of you have been studying the New World Order for any length of time, I am sure by now at this stage you have come across the Freemasons. On the outset the Freemasons claim to be a fraternity, nothing more than a big boy’s club, while many claim that it is behind the doors of societies such as that of the Freemasons, that politics and many important world issues are dictated and decided. It is most notably coined a “society with secrets” rather than a secret society. They are only one of many secret societies in the world today; however many that we are familiar with today have their roots in masonry, even those claiming to anti-masonic (left-right paradigm?). I am not about to claim that the Freemasons are the source of the world conspiracy, but more to take a look at what ties them to it.  While one cannot disagree that the involvement of many important historical, political and other such influential figures in Freemasonry is nothing short of suspicious, I would suggest that it is more than just a big boy’s club, and the ultimate goal is more than political, although this is one of the areas upon which this goal is manifest. From history we can see that the Freemasons left their mark on many important areas of history, such as the French and American Revolutions.  One only has to look at the architecture in many of our modern day cities to see the prevalence of their symbols. It is also worthwhile noting that it is from Freemasonry that Adam Weishaupt went on to establish The Illuminati in 1776.</p>

<p>Throughout history the Masons have been subject to much controversy. You will all be familiar with Captain Morgan. Well his real name was William, and he was not a pirate (although it is believed he owned a brewery). In 1826, he started a movement against the Freemasons and threatened to publish a book exposing their secrets. He was kidnapped and subsequently disappeared. A brutalised body turned up some time later that was believed to be him. Following this, Thurlow Weed set up the first Anti-Masonic party. It ran a presidential candidate in 1828, but by 1835, was nearly defunct.</p>
<p>Many Hells Fire Clubs were organised by prominent Masons. It is claimed that these were like masonic orgies, much like the Kubrick film ‘Eyes Wide Shut’. Watch <a href="http://www.alluc.org/movies/watch-Eyes-Wide-Shut-1999-online/113633.html">here</a></p>

alt="" width="423" height="285" />Freemasonry is divided into a hierarchical structure, in order to conceal knowledge. The first three degrees are as follows &#8211; Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason, all of which require the candidate to participate in an enacted drama and&#8230;</p>
<p>“are a system of initiation that allows men to become familiar with the august and ancient history and principles of Masonry at a comfortable pace. Proceeding from Entered Apprentice to Master Mason in the US can take as little as three months, while in England, the degrees are spaced apart by a year&#8217;s interval.” [2]</p>
<p>After completing the three degrees of Symbolic or Craft Masonry, a Master Mason can proceed down one of two branches… The Scottish Rite or the York Rite [consisting of Royal Arch Masons, Cryptic Masons, and Knights Templar]. The Scottish Rite, the more popular includes the degrees from the 4° to the 32° and should be called additional degrees, rather than higher degrees.

alt="" width="160" height="191" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Here we see an initiation ritual, which Pink mimicked in her performance at the MTV Music Awards</p></div>
<p>If it is merely political and economic control that the Masons are after, why is it that still after all this time there is so much mystery that still surrounds them? The secret handshakes, the rituals, the symbols. There is something below the surface, beyond the realm of financial gain.</p>
<p>The origins of the handshakes seem to be in the days of operative masonry, from when it was about concealing the secrets of their trade, so as to continue to have a monopoly of this information. The rituals however raise more questions than they answer&#8230;.</p>
<p>Alice Bailey, whose husband Foster was a notable Freemason, claims that Freemasonry is the Babylonian Mystery Schools in their purest form.  It should be no surprise to hear then that many Freemasons claim to trace their origins back to Nimrod, with the undertaking to build the infamous Tower of Babel. It was Nimrod, and then later also Nebuchadnezzar who first attempted to unify the world under the first World Order of the Babylonian Empire. It is from the Babylonian Empire that much of what we know today as the “mystery religions”, the occult, etc appear to have originated and spread throughout the world.</p>
<p>In order to conceal knowledge, Albert Pike, what is known as the Masonic &#8220;Bible&#8221;, <em>Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Order of Freemasonry</em> states that lower level initiates are deliberately deceived in what they are involved in:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Masonry, like all the Religions, all the Mysteries, Hermeticism and Alchemy, conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled &#8230;”“The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them; but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them. Their true explication is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry.” (pp. 104, 105 &amp; 819)</p></blockquote>
<p>That is to say, that most Freemasons have no idea as to what it is they are involved in. Pike’s book is said to only be given to the Master Masons, however at some point it was leaked and has now become a matter of public record. It is estimated that for every hundred Masons, ten will read it, three will finish it and only one will understand it. Concealing knowledge is a tactic that is currently being practised by the New World Order in attempting to achieve their goals, most notable through the Rothschild&#8217;s and Rockefeller’s owning the vast majority of media outlets such as Reuter’s and Associated Press, Fox News, News of the World, BBC, and the editors of major news outlets attending Bilderberg and Trilateral Commission meetings and promising not to report of any of the proceeding.</p>
<p>So if the low level initiates have no idea what it is they are involved in, it is back to the writings of high level Masons we must return. Most notably Pike and Manly P. Hall, who are considered to be two of the most influential Masons, particularly on philosophical and spiritual matters.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The Masonic religion should be, by all of us initiates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian doctrine.&#8221;</em> (Albert Pike)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<strong>Lucifer, the <em>Light-bearer</em> !  Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of darkness!  Lucifer, the Son of the Morning!   It is he who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable, blinds feeble, sensual or selfish souls?   Doubt it not!&#8221;</strong> &#8211; Albert Pike,<em> Morals and Dogma of the ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry</em>, p321, 19th Degree of Grand Pontiff</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The day has come when Fellow Craftsman (Freemason) must know and apply their knowledge. The lost key to their grade is the mastery of emotion, which places the energy of the universe at their disposal. Man can only expect to be entrusted with great power by proving his ability to use it constructively and selflessly. When the Mason learns that the key to the warrior on the block is the proper application of the dynamo of living power, he has learned the mystery of his CRAFT. The seething energies of LUCIFER are in his hands, and before he may step onward and upward, he must prove his ability to properly apply energy. He must follow in the footsteps of his forefather, Tubal-Cain, who with the mighty strength of the war god hammered his sword into a plowshare.&#8221;</em> Manly P. Hall, 33rd Degree Mason, K.T., <em>The Lost Keys of Freemasonry or The Secret of Hiram Abiff</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What a revelation!  From the first degree, the first Initiation, the Mason is urged mightily to &#8220;<em>seek the </em><strong><em>Light</em></strong>&#8220;!  It is not until the 19<sup>th</sup> Degree that it is revealed that Lucifer is the Light which they are worshipping. Lucifer was considered to be one of the highest of God’s of angels, many believe a seraphim, who had direct access to the throne of God. He was an angel of light. However, Lucifer fell from his throne of grace, claiming he could be like the most High, rebelling against God and taking one third of God’s angels with him. It is thought that Lucifer was jealous of humanity, being made in the image of God and thus as well as bringing some of God’s angels down with him, he also sought to bring down humanity. It should come as no surprise then to see his influence in the likes of Masonry and the New World Order, considering he is said to be ruler of this Earth. Whether or not you believe, one thing is for certain &#8211; they do!</p>
<p>A look at much of the symbolism of Masonry, only seeks to further prove the conviction that they are worshipping and involved in dark forces. All occult symbolism is in fact <strong>dualistic in meaning or interpretation</strong>, in that, it has an exoteric or outward meaning (known to the masses) and an esoteric or hidden meaning (known only to the elect few). Let’s take a quick look at some of them…</p>
<p><strong>Black and White Floor</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.christian-restoration.com/fmasonry/images/floor.gif" alt="" width="199" height="158" />&#8220;..Yes, Lucifer is god, and unfortunately Adonay [God of the Universe] is also God, for the eternal law is that there is no light without shade, no beauty without ugliness, <strong>no white without black</strong>, for the absolute can only exist as <strong>two gods</strong>, darkness being necessary for light to serve as its foil, as the pedestal is necessary to the statue, and the brake to the locomotive..&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>- General Albert Pike, Grand Commander, sovereign pontiff of universal freemasonry, giving instructions to the 23 supreme councils of the world. Recorded by A.C. De La Rive, La Femme et L’enfant dans La Franc-Maconnerie Universelle, Page 588. Cited from ‘The question of freemasonry, ( 2nd edition 1986 by Edward Decker pp12-14)</p>
<p><strong>The 33rd Degree Eagle<img class="alignright" src="http://www.christian-restoration.com/fmasonry/images/eagle.jpg" alt="" width="149" height="211" /></strong></p>
<p>The double headed eagle alludes to the nature of man. The head that looks to the east is symbolic of man&#8217;s spiritual vision and the head that looks west refers to his material visions&#8217; (James 1:8 &#8211; a double mended man is unstable in all his ways).</p>
<p>This divine eagle with two heads facing away from each other is linked into the meaning of the black and white floor in all masonic lodges.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.christian-restoration.com/fmasonry/images/eye.gif" alt="" width="111" height="106" /> <strong>The All-Seeing Eye</strong></p>
<p>This sysmbol is used with minor variations &#8211; in Nazism, on dollar bills, New Age, the Orange Order and in many occult orders.</p>
<p>The All-Seeing Eye is the embelm of Osiris the Creator, whose &#8216;power was symbolised by an eye over a Sceptre. The Sun was termed by the Greeks the Eye of Jupiter, and the Eye of the world; and his (Osiris&#8217;) is the All-Seeing Eye in our lodges.&#8217; &#8211; Albert Pike, <em>Morals &amp; Dogma</em>: pages 15-16</p>
<p>Sometimes this symbol is known as &#8216;The Eye of Horus&#8217;.  In mythology , Horus was born out of the incestuous relationship between Osiris and his sister Isis. As the Babylonian Empire spread South, the so-called Gods of Babylon, Nimrod, Semiramis &amp; Tammuz became known as Horus, Osiris &amp; Isis. The Eye of Horus is the eye of Nimrod, who ruled from a pyramid overlooking Babylon, he claimed to be watching over the whole empire.           <img class="alignright" src="http://www.christian-restoration.com/fmasonry/images/square&amp;compass.gif" alt="" width="148" height="145" /></p>

<p><strong>The Letter &#8216;G&#8217;<br />
</strong></p>
<p>In the blue degrees the new Mason is told that the &#8216;G&#8217; stands for &#8216;Geometry&#8217; or &#8216;God&#8217;. The occultist Eliphas Levi, much quoted by Albert Pike in <em>Moral and Dogma</em> explains &#8220;G which Freemasons place in the centre of the Burning Star signifies Gnosis and Generation, the two sacred words of the ancient Kabbalah&#8221; -<em> Masonic and occult symbols illustrated</em>, Dr. Cathy Burns</p>
<p>[yframe url='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzQ4Qvf2AE']</p>
<p>This is all religion you might say, what does it have to do with the New World Order? Personally, it brings to mind the words of David Spangler, Director of Planetary Initiative, United Nations –</p>
<blockquote><p>“No one may enter the New Age unless he takes a Luciferian Initiation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The United Nations is not the benevolent organisation many  believe it to be, being in fact one of the major vehicles for bringing about the New World Order, politically and spiritually, most clearly illustrated in the writings of Alice A. Bailey. The New Age, being the New Age of the World Order. It would appear that they have been slowly initiating us into their way of thinking.</p>
<p>In being familiar with the idea of the New World Order, it should come as no surprise to hear that Masonry has a policy of universality because of course there cannot be a one world order without first being universality.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Further global progress is now possible, only through a quest for universal consensus in the movement towards a New World Order.” – </em>Mikhail Gorbachev<em>, in address at UN, Dec  1988</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So it will be a consensus and a universal one at that in order to accept this New World Order. Some would maintain that the concept of universality is in fact something that should be aimed for, something that is good, ultimately with it comes the loss of individuality, both personally and nationally, therefore the loss of national boundaries, sovereignty, identity, and heritage. It is the erosion of these things that will bring about the concept of being citizens of Earth and lead us towards a One World Government, i.e. the further consolidation of power into the hands of the few.</p>
<p>Hall himself writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The New Atlantis sets forth an ideal government of the earth. It foretells that day when in the midst of men there shall rise up a vast institution composed of the philosophic elect — an order of illumined men banded together for the purpose of investigating the laws of life and the mysteries of the universe … The age of boundaries is closing, and we are approaching a nobler era when nations shall be no more; when the lines of race and caste shall be wiped out;<strong> when the whole earth shall be under one order, one government, one administrative body</strong>.” -Manly P Hall “<em>Lectures on Ancient Philosophy</em>,” published by the Philosophical Research Society Inc, Los Angeles (1970)</p></blockquote>
<p>This concept of the elect to rule the Earth is nothing new, and was laid out in Plato’s Republic around 350BC. It was also Plato that first wrote of Atlantis, and it is still unknown as to whether this was an allegorical or literal place. However, we are at a point in time where this world order seems more possible than ever. The world seems smaller than it ever has, and with the failure of national governments, banking systems, the abuse within the church most people are crying out for something better. It should the idea of this New Atlantis that is most startling! While again this is not a new idea – Francis Bacon heralded America to be the New Atlantis and look at how that has turned out! It is being rebranded and remarketed for the new generation through the no doubt mislabelled to deceive New Age (for there is nothing new under the sun). Many New Age teachers tell us that the New Atlantis is soon to rise, and that some of us are volunteer souls, choosing to be here from the previous fall in order to help bring this about. Could this be the same Atlantis Hall is speaking of? Seeing how the masons and Illuminati trace their teachings back to Babylon, yet cry for a new Atlantis, I’d be willing to speculate that the New Atlantis is actually the New Babylon, the New World Order.</p>
<p>Under the banner of universality, all teaching and ideas become accepted as “truth” – no right or wrong. Therefore there is not seen to be one objective truth. However, the very nature of truth dictates that all things cannot be true. If I can make a statement, such as the sky is blue then automatically I have stated that it is not red or yellow, or any other colour other than blue. Therefore truth in its nature is divisive, and it separates truth from lies. Everything cannot be true, this in itself is a lie. If somebody states “There is no objective truth”, then I might rebut stating that that sentence isn’t necessarily true, therefore there is objective truth, and the original statement becomes a falsehood. Subjective Truth leads to endless paradoxes and is well suited to a world that would like to make their own truth rather than face the cold hard facts. We may be all one of the same species, but we are individuals within that. What works for one of us, will not always work for the other, the same applies to nations. However, mason in their own words are attempting to bring everything under that banner of universality, to be a platform that may be acceptable to all thinkers, and to provide the one world religion.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A revitalised Masonry, made up of Masons true to their obligations, and realising the Mystic Tie that binds them all together in one true brotherhood, would also provide a platform so universal that it would meet the need of thinkers of all kinds and of every school of thought. It would thus not only meet a religious need by providing a universal religion, but would also satisfy the mental need felt by all broad-minded thinkers at this time.&#8221; &#8211; Foster Bailey, 32nd degree Freemason, husband of Alice Bailey the head of Theosophy and Grande Dame of the New Age Movement.</p></blockquote>
<p>When you think of the Roman Empire, we know they had political and financial control but it was the religious control that sealed the deal, as the emperor was considered to be a God and to be worshipped as such. This practise originated in Babylon, and continued under the Vatican, and it is for this reason  it must be sacrificed by the very hand that controls it – to build a climate to accept the new religion of the World, the one that will go hand in hand with their New World Order, and one that many today will welcome.</p>
<p>As you can see freemasonry is one of the many vehicles being used to bring it about the World Order. Considering claims that Nimrod is the father of Freemasonry, the attempted World Order with the construction of the Tower of Babel, the EU poster clearly comparing it to this, the rise in the acceptability of Freemasonic and other occult teaching, particularly in the Truth Movement, it seems that they are telling us, not only their goal, how they will achieve it but also who it is they are working for. However, many of us are not willing to accept this, because of the implications it would mean for everything else we have been taught to believe. Instead we choose to continue to think that this is merely about political and financial gain, and that it will be over once the police state crumbles. This is what we have been prepared to believe. As Gorbachev stated, it must be by consensus that it is to be brought about.</p>
<div style="width: 689px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://www.redicecreations.com/winterwonderland/babylonEU4.jpg" alt="" width="679" height="489" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The tower of Babel was the beginning of the first World Empire, it is said that to stop this, God confounded the tongues of the masons and they spread abroad the Earth. Since then it seems their descendants have been trying to unify the world as one Empire again, so it can be ruled by one man. Many tongues, One Voice, One World Order.</p></div>
<p>It seems like a classic smoke and mirrors tactic. On one hand they have us looking at the banking and political system, seeing the banking system collapse, the growth of movement such as Occupy Wall Street (<a href="http://occupywallst.org/forum/global-democracy-a-new-porposal-against-global-eco/">which are calling out for global, yes <strong>global</strong> democracy</a>). This is leading us to believe that the New World Order is collapsing. However, I would suggest that this more the paradigm of the Old World Order we are watching  die, and they want it to die. While many are calling for the removal of the 1%, there is still so much secrecy around who this 1% actually are. The likes of the Rothschild, the Rockefellers are kept out of the spot light, while they continue with their agenda and the United Nations continue to be painted as the good guys. When the Old World Order collapses many will rejoice, claiming we have won and defeated the NWO, while at the same time accepting the belief systems and doctrines that they have been writing about as the ultimate achievement of their end goal.<br />

It&#8217;s 2012, and as predicted, the ISPs and Hollywood &amp; Music Industry lobyists now have more power than ever before. With the advent of PIPA, SOPA, ACTA and more, the shutdown of many filesharing and video-sharing sites, the little guys is now the target of internet bad guys who don&#8217;t think they are rich enough. There are reports of peoples uTorrents being shut down without warning, and this is just the beginning. Below I outline just a few tips I&#8217;ve picked up over the years to maximise your anonymity online.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">First off i would reccomend to make sure you are not using Internet Explorer. I personally advocate firefox, its not made by MS or Google. its desgined by the online community and comes with an optional add-on called adblock plus, which automatically blocks internet ads and scripts you dont want.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Download Firefox here.</a><br />
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/" target="_blank">Adblock here.</a></p>
<p>Also if you already have FF make sure it is updated to the latest version (10 as of Feb 2) by clicking Help &#8211; About Firefox.</p>
<p>If you have it installed make sure to set third party cookies to asking you only and whatever other privacy options you want to enable, theres a whole section on <a href="http://infosecurity.wonderhowto.com/blog/secure-your-firefox-browser-0132322/" target="_blank">securing your FF here.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="width: 637px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class=" " src="http://cdn-www.i-am-bored.com/media/blackoutMarch.jpg" alt="" width="627" height="469" /><p class="wp-caption-text">We advocate supporting Black March, make a dent in the profits of these lobyists.</p></div>
<p><a href="http://infosecurity.wonderhowto.com/blog/secure-your-firefox-browser-0132322/" target="_blank"><br />
</a></p>
<p>A proxy is another way to stay anonymous. It routes your internet traffic through a foreign server so websites think you are coming from Japan or the US and cant track you properly. Theres plenty of good sfotware out there but the simplest one ive found is made by <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/dd-wrt_privacy" target="_blank">DD-WRT</a>, but you need to have adblock installed as well because it comes with internet ads ironically. I use it regularly, very very simple to use, just right click it to enable and suddenly you&#8217;re anonymous.</p>
<p>It is not compatible with utorrent or alot of downloading sofware, so we need something different for that.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been using uTorrent to download for a while you may have found yourself receiving lots of wasted data. This is data that has been discarded after being deemed corrupt or invalid by uTorrent.</p>
<p>This usually happens because Anti-P2P organizations are polluting P2P networks with fake peers, which send out fake or corrupt data in order to waste bandwidth and slow down file transfers. There is also a a more serious side to this, once you&#8217;ve established a connection to one of these fake &#8220;peers&#8221;, your IP has been logged and will most likely be sent to the RIAA, MPAA or your ISP to inform them what you have been downloading.</p>
<p>You can easily block these bad IP ranges in uTorrent by enabling the IP filter and using a simple script to update the IP block list each day.</p>
<p><a href="http://digiex.net/guides-reviews/guides-tutorials/application-guides/937-enable-update-ip-filter-block-list-utorrent-ipfilter-dat.html" target="_blank">Add the Ipfilter here.</a></p>
<p>The way things are going these days, there will be a lot of anti-P2P orgs trying to query your downloading habits, so update it every couple of weeks, or set it <a href="http://www.teckh.com/?p=185" target="_blank">auto enable using this script</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.wearechange.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/google-extremes.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2130" src="http://www.wearechange.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/google-extremes.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Google, whose company motto is &#8220;Don&#8217;t be evil&#8221; have recently enabled <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/maybe-its-time-for-google-to-rethink-its-dont-be-evil-motto/2012/01/25/gIQAAS0XRQ_story.html" target="_blank">data sharing for your accounts over all networks.</a> That means you will have your Google+ results howing up in searches, its gonna take ito account past searches and friends and these things while searching, building one big online profile about you.</p>
<p>Theres a few ways around this (sort of).</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you are on Firefox with adblock and maximised privacy settings.</li>
<li>For things you don&#8217;t want tracked, use a seperate google account or sign out and enable private browsing in firefox (Ctrl + Shift + P)</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t use your real name or personal deatils, those are optionally true fields. Use a nickname on facebook and google+, this will also stop employers from Googleing your name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking of which, facebook probably have edited your privacy settings to public, watch this video to figure out how to change them to private.</p>

<strong>What is truth?</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to alert those who want to know what really is, and what is not; and are willing to sacrifice even their comfortable lies on the alter of truth no matter what that truth is. This is more central to the goal and source of the new world order than much of what is typically plastered on the internet about the subject. I implore all of you to read this with an open mind and if possible with a mind so open as to genuinely allow for the possibility that you are wrong about beliefs you hold dearly. Hard as it was I&#8217;ve had to do this a few times, to really let false beliefs be stripped away from me and be freed from misleading, spiritually poisonous, but emotionally cherished teachings. What follows might sound crazy, but we should be well used to that at this stage, and you cannot hope to give a sane sounding explanation of such an insane world.</p>
<p>A new world religion is being crafted around us, and is one of the most important goals for the new world, and has been actively moved towards for at least 60 years. This most likely will not be a set of established immutable doctrines that the world will be forced to accept, rather it will probably be a set of core principles; principals that the world is currently being, and for a long time has been, groomed to embrace. Soon, we will be faced with a choice, but the problem is the world has been so thoroughly prepped; we have had the deep recesses of our subconscious minds prepared to make the choice that the rulers of the darkness of this world want and need you to make. They have engineered our consent. I intend in this article to demonstrate this fact. And to point out that it is being done, chiefly by men and women who in their own words (for which I will provide quotes) worship Lucifer. This involves organizations like the UN, the Lucis Trust, the Theosophy Society and the Freemasons.</p>
<p>I can think of no better place to start than with Alice A. Bailey. Bailey was a member of the Theosophy Society, and the protégé of its founder, H.P. Blavatsky. Concerning her God, Blavatsky had this to say;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;And now it stands proven that Satan, or the Red Fiery Dragon, the &#8216;Lord of Phosphorus,&#8217; and Lucifer, or &#8216;Light-Bearer,&#8217; is in us: it is our Mind – our tempter and Redeemer, our intelligent liberator and Saviour from pure animalism.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Blavatsky also founded Lucifer Magazine. Alice Bailey went on to found what is today know as the Lucis Trust but was originally founded as the Lucifer Publishing Company. Through this company she wrote many books (or according to her, a spirit named Djwhal Khul wrote the books through her) about the coming new age, and the new world order that would be necessary for humanity to correctly enter the new age.</p>
<p>Note; the Lucifer Publishing Company has since it&#8217;s founding been part of the United Nations, as an NGO, and has for decades enjoyed consultancy status with the UN. Robert Muller, former assistant secretary general of the UN, established the World Core Curriculum. This is the backbone that lies underneath the educational policies of all nations that are members of the UN. Robert Muller had this to say:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;the underlying philosophy upon which the Robert Muller School is based will be found in the teaching set forth in the books of Alice Bailey by the Tibetan teacher Djwhal Khul.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The World Core Curriculum is based on the curriculum of the Robert Muller Schools. The World Core Curriculum (WCC) was, Muller wrote, a response to &#8220;an outcry by educators expressing the need for a global curriculum.&#8221; Muller became known as &#8220;the father of global education&#8221; for crafting the WCC. The WCC was first used in the few &#8220;Robert Muller Schools&#8221; around the world, alternately known as &#8220;Schools of the Ageless Wisdom&#8221;, to &#8220;enable the student to become true planetary citizens&#8221;. More on that HERE, please read it, it is an excellent article. Herein we see that the underlying philosophy of such a pivotal and globally influential curriculum is based (by the account of the Muller himself) on doctrines taken from a spirit that came through the Luciferian Theosophist &#8211; Alice Bailey. Most of this came from the book ‘Education and the New Age’. Bailey also stated in her book &#8216;The Externalisation of the Hierarchy&#8217; the following: <em> </em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;The new world order will NOT IMPOSE a uniform type of government, a synthetic religion and a system of standardisation upon the nations…. In one particular only should there be an attempt to produce unity, and that will be in the field of <strong>education</strong>.&#8221;</em> (Emphasis added).</p>
<p>She stated there that it is through education that such things will come about. By the time they are ready to move this to the next level, the vast majority of the human population will already have been groomed sufficiently and will already have unconsciously made the choice that will then be offered to them. I want to also point out that Bailey and Blavatsky separately are both widely thought of as mothers of the new age movement. Both women have well earned that title.</p>
<p>And now we move on to the infamous Freemasons. They have a publication which has been running for a long time called the New Age Magazine, which also is preparing hearts and minds of its readers for the new age. But I want to focus more on straight up Luciferianism as that is what you arrive at when you peel back the veil that the cloaks the new age. There is quite a lot of talk about the conditioning of humanity to accept Luciferian philosophies, but none declare it better than 33<sup>rd</sup> degree Freemason Albert Pike. Read this letter from Pike to fellow Luciferian Giuseppe Mazzini and note what he says about Luciferian doctrine and that which serves as the impulsion to adopt it, and please note the timing of it too:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The First World War must be brought about in order to permit the Illuminati to overthrow the power of the Czars in Russia and of making that country a fortress of atheistic Communism. The divergences caused by the agentur (agents) of the Illuminati between the British and Germanic Empires will be used to foment this war. At the end of the war, Communism will be built and used in order to destroy the other governments and in order to weaken the religions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Second World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences between the Fascists and the political Zionists. This war must be brought about so that Nazism is destroyed and that the political Zionism be strong enough to institute a sovereign state of Israel in Palestine. During the Second World War, International Communism must become strong enough in order to balance Christendom, which would be then restrained and held in check until the time when we would need it for the final social cataclysm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the agentur of the Illuminati between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam and political Zionism mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion…We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view. This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.”</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Seems also that the rulers of the darkness of this world hate Christianity, even though many people in the ‘truth’ movement have it that the Bible is the book being used to foment the troubles of this world and that the Illuminati (or a group like it) wrote the Bible for their diabolical purposes, a statement with no basis in fact. No, the mystery religion hates Christianity because <em>they consider it</em> a perversion of their religion. Evidence that they had nothing to do with the writing of the Bible. Note also that Serge Monast was ‘heart attacked’ to death as was his colleague within a short time period, for revealing Project Bluebeam and the Christian holocaust that will follow, which is a major agenda for the new world order.</p>
<p>Please note that there are quite a few people, mostly Masonic apologists, who claim Pike&#8217;s letter doesn’t exist. However it was recorded as being in the British Museum Library, as well it’s content was recorded, in 1925 in the book ‘The Mystery of Freemasonry Unveiled’ by <em>Caro y Rodriguez. Note; the book predates WWII by 14 years </em>and the creation of the State of Israel by 23 years<em>.</em></p>
<p>Pike also had this to say: &#8220;That which we must say to the crowd (the masses or the &#8216;profane&#8217;) is: We worship a God, but it is the God one adores without superstition. To you, Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, we say this, that you may repeat it to the Brethren of the 32<sup>nd</sup>, 31<sup>st</sup>, and 30<sup>th</sup> degrees: The Masonic Religion should be, by all of us initiates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian doctrine.&#8221; Note: Pike was also known as the &#8216;Plato of Freemasonry&#8217;. This quote is interesting in relation to what Pike say about the 32<sup>nd</sup>, 31<sup>st</sup> and 30<sup>th</sup> degrees when considering that Alice Bailey&#8217;s husband, Foster Bailey, was a 32<sup>nd</sup> degree Freemason who also wrote books published by his wife&#8217;sTLucifer Publishing Company.</p>
<p><strong>The seething energies of Lucifer</strong></p>
<p>Next, is what the hugely respected 32<sup>nd</sup> degree freemason Manly P. Hall had to say; &#8220;When a Mason learns that the key to the warrior on the block is the proper application of the dynamo of living power, the seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands and before he may step onward and upward, he must prove his ability to properly apply this energy.&#8221; Please note; Hall was called &#8216;Masonry&#8217;s Greatest Philosopher’ in the September 1990 issue of The Scottish Rite Journal. So the advancement of Lucifer worship is what earns prestige in Freemasonry?</p>
<p>Next in this motley crew is a ridiculous character named Benjamin Creme whose mission for the last few decades has been to prepare humanity for the reception of the &#8216;World Teacher&#8217;, the ‘Maitreya’ ‘the Christ’ and ‘the Messiah’ (not to be confused with the focus of Christian worship). He also calls him the ‘Imam Mahdi’, ‘Krishna’ and the ‘Avatar for the Aquarian Age.’ Creme elevates this man to the point of deification; In 1980 Creme wrote a book called ‘The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of Wisdom’ about the coming of this man. In 1982 he put an ad in the newspapers costing $500,000 to announce the appearance of Maitreya &#8211; what he then anticipated has not yet occurred. If you asked him, he would probably give you a vague and vacuous reason as to why it hasn’t happened, maybe the ‘energies’ were all wrong or something like that. He is today still preparing the way. This world teacher is sometimes referred to as the world leader, and to Alice Bailey he is called ‘the Great One’. To be honest, when Luciferians the world over begin to deify and herald the coming of one important mystical man talked about in relation to a global empire, that’s when I read Prophecy with nervous anticipation.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark orthe name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.&#8221; Revelation 13:16-18</em></p>
<p>Creme also had this to say:<em> &#8220;Far from being evil it is pure light. In the esoteric teaching, Lucifer is the name for the great angelic Entity who embodies the human kingdom on the soul plane.&#8221;</em> Again I point out, a man who venerates Lucifer is preparing the world for its leader and teacher.</p>
<p>In relation to ‘the Great One’ and also preparing mankind to accept certain occult philosophies, Alice Bailey said in ‘The Externalisation of the Hierarchy’:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is no question therefore that the work to be done in familiarising the general public with the nature of the Mysteries is of paramount importance at this time. These Mysteries will be restored to outer expression through the medium of the Church and the Masonic Fraternity, if those groups leave off being organisations with material purpose, and become organisms with living objectives. When the Great One comes with His disciples and initiates we shall have (after a period of intensive work on the physical plane beginning around the year 1940) the restoration of the Mysteries and their exoteric presentation, as a consequence of the first initiation. Why can this be so? Because the Christ, as you know, is the Hierophant of the first and second initiations and He will, if the preparatory work is faithfully and well done, administer the first initiation in the inner sanctuaries of those two bodies. Many faithful workers will, during His period of work on earth, take this first initiation, and some few will take the second. The race has now reached a point where many souls are on the Probationary Path and need but the heightening of their vibration (made possible by His Presence) to reach the portal of the Path itself.”</p></blockquote>
<p>David Spangler, a prolific new age author had this to say:<em> &#8220;Lucifer comes to give us the final gift of wholeness. If we accept it, then he is free and we are free, that is the Luciferic Initiation. It is one that many people now, and in the days ahead, will be facing, for it is an initiation into the New Age.&#8221;</em> and also this: <em>&#8220;No one will enter the New World Order unless he or she will make a pledge to worship Lucifer. No one will enter the New Age unless he will take a Luciferian Initiation.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the future of this doctrine?</strong></p>
<p>The new world religion I mentioned, is actually a luciferic religion wherein man deifies himself, and venerates he who has lead man to believe himself God, namely, Lucifer. And also, it consists of the doctrine that we will transcend this realm of reality and be promoted to a new and higher realm of vibration thereby entraining to the next plain of ‘our Godhood’. If such teachings are true, one wonders why it is being taught in a way that you don&#8217;t see it coming, and in almost every case, aren&#8217;t going to get a chance to critically analyze it, and therefore cannot possibly make an informed decision about it. It is being sold through education (World Core Curriculum) and the media (many films promote the idea, symbolically, like Knowing and Another Earth) it becomes part of your core belief system through the subconscious mind, and as is characteristic of the subconscious mind, you become saturated to the core with such beliefs without even being aware that it’s happening to you. There are many more things to do with this coming world religion in which Hollywood has played a major part but that is for another article. Very long story short, we are being sold a new system of thought. Remember though, I said it most likely will not be a set of established immutable doctrines that the world will be forced to accept, rather it will probably be a set of core principles that the world is currently being, and for a long time has been, groomed to embrace. At least, that is at first. These people have a habit of being diplomatically evil when in positions of weakness, and brutally obviously evil when in positions of strength. Once this new system is firmly established, I doubt you will be offered much choice</p>
<p>We ought to be very careful with the doctrines we pin our hopes to. Like I said, a one-world religion is being crafted around us. And it is being done so in the image of the old mystery religion that like all corrupt trees that bear spiritual fruits, this new world religion has it&#8217;s roots in Babylon. It has the same roots as the Freemasons, the Rosicrucians, the Theosophy Society, the Thule Society, the Skull and Bones society, the Knights of Malta, the Knights of Columbanus, the Knights Templar and many more. These are the Babylonian Mystery cults who now work to groom the public to accept their core doctrines. And it is working like a charm. The new age is completely rooted in the ancient mystery religion which the most corrupt men and women on the face of the Earth, and throughout it&#8217;s history, have belonged to, and been influenced by; corruption is the fruit of this tree. The same tree has the same roots; the same tree means bears the same fruits. If this is news to you, and you believe new age teachings please consider revising everything upon which you based your spiritual path lest you be caught in the snare of the new world religion, of self-deification and do what thou wilt. If you wish to believe that ‘ye shall be as Gods’ you at least now know by whom that doctrine has been pushed, and you have been warned.</p>

<p>Independent Journalist &#8220;Madam K&#8221; was stopped at a newly erected  police  barrier in Dublin today during the visit of the  German/pseudo-English  Queen Saxe-Coburg-Gotha/Wettin. The garda told  her that &#8220;under the  warrant you cant have a flag at the moment!&#8221;</p>
<p>The act she referenced was the Public Order Act Section 21. It states   &#8220;indicate that to proceed beyond the barrier while in possession of  any  intoxicating liquor, disposable drinks container or offensive  article  will render such liquor, container or article liable to  confiscation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bit she means is the &#8220;offensive article&#8221;.</p>
<p>Thats what we&#8217;re reduced to in this country. There was probably a   tricolour flying as that bangarda took an oath to &#8220;serve her county&#8221;   *ahem* and now she&#8217;s reduced to confiscating them for the Royals.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m seriously contemplating buying a tricolour and parading it around the Gardai tomorrow. Anyone else??</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abi3hgIxtNM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abi3hgIxtNM</a></p>
<p>In Ireland when you leave school you do a leaving certificate which  is graded by the number of points you attain. If  you study hard you  might get 600 points and  have the  opportunity of doing pharmacy or  medicine or veterinary science. After that different levels of points  will get you into different college courses and different levels of  further education. Throughout  the schooling we learn all about the  struggle Ireland has had through  800 years of oppression by Britain  (whichever foreign royal faction was  running the show). We learn of the  sacrifices made in winning back  independence finally in 1922 and the  death and suffering it took to win  it.</p>
<h3>Yet:</h3>
<p>To become a guardian of the peace, a police  officer, a Garda. You  can leave school with just 140 points. To hold  such an important and  powerful position in society surely the best and  brightest should be  employed, not the leftovers after the brains went  off to do something  else?</p>

<p>Look  at this picture and you can see  the results of this enrollment policy.  The Gardai throwing our national  flag into a bin lorry. This is only  indicative of course but it is  indicative of the other mindless things  the Gardai now do.</p>
<p>They  are &#8220;just following orders&#8221; they tell you when they enact more  and more  wholly unlawful new legal statutes. This defense didn&#8217;t work  at  Nuremberg and it wont work now as they blindly implement tyranny. We   see Gardai confiscating the national flag as the queen of England is   here. How fast do you think the men who died in the war of independence   are spinning in their graves?</p>
<p>We see them arresting people for  filming, or for standing up for  their right to not be interfered with  while they are not committing any  real crime with a real victim. Sadly  it is always the stupidity of the  police in any country that supports  the creeping introduction of  tyranny. Remember, everything that Hitler  did was legal. Like our  government he just changed the laws to make it  so and the police  &#8220;follow orders&#8221;. The reason tyranny will take hold is  the ignorance of  the Gardai.</p>
<p>This is why I believe it is a  deliberate recruitment policy to  police forces to employ people of lower  intelligence and reasoning  abilities. People that will not question the  sanity of the orders they  are told to perform.</p>
<p>Shame on the Gardai and shame for their willful ignorance. Shame on what this state has become.</p>

	<p>Ash &#8211; <a href="http://wearechange.ie/" target="_blank">We Are Change Ireland</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s that time again &#8211; the Elections! Its that time, when even the   people who rarely voice on opinion or take an interest in what is   happening the in political field suddenly become interested! Everyone   has an opinion now on what way the country should be run. Rather than   look for real change, about what we can do in our communities, on a   local even grassroots level, a lot of people are still looking to Big <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Brother </span>, I mean Government to present the &#8220;best&#8221; ideas for this country. <a href="http://www.sovereignindependent.com/the-leftright-paradigm-can-fine-gael-or-sinn-fein-save-us-well-no/" target="_blank">The Puppet on the Left, or The Puppet on the right!</a></p>
<p>I think its fairly safe to say the Fianna Fáil government they won&#8217;t  be voted back in! They  have clearly just robbed us blind, and after 15  years in power, the  media gave them some crash.</p>
<p>Since Lisbon, many people in this country have have  been concerned  about the loss of our national sovereignty. Following the  second Lisbon  treaty, the ever increasing role of Europe, and the IMF  deal in place  it seems as though we are getting closer and closer to being just  another member state, with limited say in our own affairs.The idea of  having EU troops in our country and on our streets is  something that  sends a shiver right to the hearts of many Irish people &#8211;  lest we  forget that British troops only left the &#8220;Republic&#8221; in 1922,  and  Northern Ireland in 2007!</p>
<p>Yet talk of the European police troops on the streets of Ireland was   largely ridiculed and thought to be extremist left views or even dare I   say it &#8211; <em>conspiracy</em>!</p>
<p>Yet today, on the front page of one of Ireland&#8217;s largest circulating   paper, which is handed out freely each morning and read by droves of   people on their way to work, it clearly stated the desire for Ireland to   remove her neutrality and throw yet another piece of our sovereignty   to Europe. The idea, mainly propagated by Fine Gael and their leader,   Enda Kenny would see Ireland removing her neutral stance, and join an EU   defense and security system. And the earlier the better as far as Fine   Gael are concerned! They have stated that they want Ireland to “get   involved in the construction of a new European security system at an   early stage so that we can join and influence it.”</p>

</div>
<p>&#8230;The move, was of course was opposed by Labour and Sinn Féin.</p>
<p><em>Didn&#8217;t the Labour party campaign &#8220;Vote Yes to Lisbon&#8221;? </em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s right; the Labour Party decided to campaign for a Yes vote   even before the Lisbon Treaty was signed by European heads of government   in December!!</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lisbon Treaty acknowledges the existence of  the European Police  Office (Europol) that may support the action of  national police forces  in the collation and analysis of information.  This embryonic European  police force can also co-ordinate, organise and  even undertake  investigations and operations together with the national  police  forces.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://www.robert-schuman.eu/doc/divers/lisbonne/en/10fiches.pdf" target="_blank">source</a></p>
<p>With  that in mind, do Labour really want to preserve our sovereignty  and  prevent EU troops from being on the streets or are they just  riding the  mood current in the country?</p>
<p>When they choose to campaign Yes to Lisbon,  that in effect means the  whole Lisbon Treaty, not just the parts they  liked, because we ended  up accepting all points of the Treaty (even if  we are slow to see its  fruits!)</p>
<p><em>Ok, Ok! But Sinn Féin were &#8220;No to Lisbon&#8221;?</em></p>
<p>Sure, but have they suggested getting us out of there since the  Treaty? I agree that Sinn Féin, as founded under Arthur Griffith sounded  like a good concept. However, this is not the same Sinn Féin we see  before us today.</p>
<p>Sinn Féin have not been a majority in Government in  this country for  a long time now. In that time, they have split, both  within themselves  (Republican Sinn Féin) and created many of the parties  we see today  (such as Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael) and they have been  infiltrated! We  are not always as privy to the going&#8217;s on of this party  as they are in  the North. Considering that Adams, the party leader of  Sinn Féin since  1983 built most of his career in the North I think it is  important to  consider the role he and the party have had, as ultimately  it is the  whole party and its leader that you vote for not just your  local  candidate.<br />
Sinn Féin only moved to the left in the 1960&#8242;s,  showing that a party can and has<em> changed its sides to ride the tides</em>.  Following the  Good  Friday Agreement and the Peace Process, many in  the North felt  that the  party they had supported for so long, had  turned their backs  on their  promises to them and were now off to play  the game of  politics!</p>
<p>It has been documented that Sinn Féin in the North have been inflirated by Mi5. In the last few years, some of Adams&#8217; closest <a href="http://www.wiseupjournal.com/?p=133" target="_blank">colleagues</a> have been outted as spys. Some former Sinn Féin supporters will go so  far as to say that a Vote for Sinn Fein is a vote for British rule,  possibly because of these links. Then of course, there is the obvious  IRA  connections, and the infamous Northern bank robbery. The official  reports claim that  the IRA was responsible for the Northern Bank  robbery and that certain senior members of Sinn Féin were also senior  members of the IRA, and would have had to have given approval to the  carrying out of the robbery. It is claimed this report is not  independent though &#8211; make what you will of that.</p>
<p><em>Ok, so maybe they aren&#8217;t that trustworthy&#8230; But what about the others, or the Independents? We have loads of choice!</em></p>
<p>Do we? Or it is just the illusion of choice?</p>
<p>[yframe url='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hp8QU4EbIo']</p>
<p>When  it comes to ruling the country, we all know it will either be  one of  the parties in a majority, or else a coalition, and then the  opposition,  who&#8217;s role is to oppose what the Government is doing. The  policies they  propagate during their campaign, can be amalgamated and  changed to  blend with another parties policies when a coalition is  required. They  often don&#8217;t even follow through with the promises they  make before the  election! John <a href="http://www.wearechange.ie/john-gormley-fluoride-gmo-and-the-rockefeller-communist-%E2%80%98coincidence%E2%80%99/" target="_blank">Gormley and the Fluoride issue </a>is a prime example of  this!</p>
<p>We vote these people in and trust that they we  go do as they  promised, even when we know in our heart and soul they  cannot be  trusted and that the democratic process was bought and sold long ago!  Yet we STILL do it!</p>
<blockquote><p><em> </em> “We can&#8217;t solve <em>problems</em> by using the <em>same</em> kind of thinking we used when we created them.” Albert Einstein</p></blockquote>
<p>The  parties may change their policies as often as they like, but the   policies of the Government of Ireland remain the same. They act as a   company trading for profit, and their role is to make profit for the   bonholders. As <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5352106773770802849#" target="_blank">money is debt</a> in this and most countries in the world, we rely on banks to loan us   money and we have to pay it back &#8211; we are in effect bankrupt and have   been for quite some time. It is not about what is best for the Irish  People. It is about allowing us to think that we have a say in how   things are run, that our voice and our vote means something.</p>
<p><strong>How  many people do you think really wanted the IMF deal? Or was  it just  because they were made to believe there was no other way?</strong></p>
<p>Not one candidate has stood up and offered real change. No one has agreed to do all of the following:<br />
- Refuse to do business with the IMF<br />
- Kick the banks and the bankers out of the country<br />
- Get out of the Euro!<br />
- Printing our own DEBT-FREE, INTEREST-FREE money<br />
- Saying no to Shell and Nationalising our resources<br />
- Reclaiming our forests from Coillte!<br />
- Saying no to Monsanto and GM<br />
- They have not even suggested putting the traitors, who sold us out on trial or behind bars!</p>
<p>None of this is impossible. <a href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/americas/news/article_1269801.php/Chavez_signs_decree_to_nationalize_foreign_oil_companies" target="_blank">Chavez</a> nationalised the oil companies in 2007, and Iceland defaulted on its debt and is jailing many of its bankers!</p>
<p>In Law, misprison of treason is neglect in preventing  or reporting a  felony or treason by one not an accessory. Those in  Government that  did not commit treason, have acquiesced and committed  misprision in  their failure to prevent the ever growing list of crimes  that the  Government have committed against the people of Ireland. This  might  actually be considered farcical and a bit funny, if it wasn&#8217;t so   serious!</p>
<p>Changing the puppet will not change the system. They will still  continue to borrow money from the banks, allowing them the  control to  create fake booms and busts, to tax us for this money they borrow, get  paid far more than the average worker will ever get and  everyone who  gets involved in that system, risks being corrupted by the flawed nature  of it. We are all weak to temptation, so why do we assume that these  people will not fall prey to the same temptations of those gone before  them?</p>
<p>They have proved they cannot be relied upon. We must stop giving away  our power, and stay relying upon ourselves again! Voting only  encourages them!<br />
It is for these reasons that we ask you to spoil your vote and Vote NO  Confidence, and withdraw your consent in the entire political system!</p>
<p>The  people reserve the right to not consent to a corrupt Government,  a corrupt system and to false solutions that serve to only enslave us  further.</p>
<p>The only thing holding us back is our fear! And the only thing we have to fear, is fear itself!</p>
<p>If voting changed anything it would be made Illegal.</p>
<p><strong>Vote No Confidence!</strong></p>
