I am an anarchist.  Yes, you read that right.  This site advances anarchism as both an ethical philosophy and a political system.  That is to say that we encourage interactions between people and groups of people on the basis of value, not need, and not force.  We believe in a fair exchange of value for value, as opposed to compulsion, tyrrany, theft and censorship.  If you take nothing else away from your time here, remember this: <b>Government is force. Anarchism opposes force</b>. 
<p />
When I tell people that I am an anarchist, I typically get one of three reactions. Most often, people will laugh. "Hah," they'll chortle, "that's funny! Now really, what are you?"  Sometimes, it will make people uncomforable, as if "bomb-throwing" is the implied adjective. Lastly, for some bizarre reason I get a lot of email from French people who are still hung up on such dated, immature ideas as "propaganda of the deed" and the Anarchist cookbook. See that bit in bold up above? I'll say it again: <i>Anarchism opposes force</i>. Bombings, assassinations, and riots can not be anarchist acts because they rely on fear, terror, and force to accomplish their goals: the very tools of the State.  We'd like to encourage our French brethren and their compatriots to leave such maniacal despotism to <a href="http://www.state.gov/">the professionals</a>.
<p />
As an ethical philosophy one might call anarchism by a different name, one that is also likely to generate strong reactions in people: capitalism. Simply stated, capitalism is the idea that <i>value exists</i>, is measurable, and transferable; that the only morally defensible system of exchange is based in this, e.g. the fair trade of value for value; and that the only fair governor of what value is worth is the free market. 
<p />
As anarchists, or as capitalists, <a href="/info/staff.php">we</a> believe in free trade. Like <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software</a>, we mean "free" in the sense of liberty ("free as in speech", not "free as in beer"). Free trade cannot exist when one, both, or all of the parties involved are compelled to participate. Thus, an economy backed by mandatory taxation cannot be free any more than a mine excavated by slaves can be. Put another way, capitalists don't interact with the world on the basis of need, but of value; capitalists reward value with value. Need rewards value with further need, and with force when that value is exhausted. 
<p />
Don't believe me? Don't pay your taxes. You'll get a nasty phone call which, if you ignore it, will get you a nasty letter. If you ignore the letter, a nasty person will show up at your door; ignore them, and more nasty people will come to you, this time with guns. If you resist the nasty people with guns, you will be beaten. Resist the beating and you will be restrained and your property and livelihood confiscated. Resist restraint and ruination and you will be killed.  As Ed Abbey says, "these procedures are known as the Rule of Law".  
<p />
Thus, we at <a href="/info/about.php">VioPac</a> hope to offer a vision of anarchism divorced from the media rhetoric. We provide a <a href="http://fora.viopac.com/">forum</a> for discussion, ranting, and snide commentary on the latest pop culture trends, some <a href="http://lists.maleficarum.org/">mailing lists</a> of various utility, interest and secrecy, assorted sarcastic commentaries on whatever we feel like at the time, and a suitably random remainder we haven't been able to solve for yet (like the Book of the Month Club).

Getting those annoying phone calls purporting to warn you that your automobile
warranty coverage is about to expire? How about sales calls to your cellular
phone? Your pals and mine in the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">FCC</a>  have a <a

can use to file a complaint. It doesn't take long and it does seem to work.

You haven't been to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;f=d&amp;daddr=50+E+Main+St+Mesa,+AZ+85201&amp;fb=1&amp;geocode=10491377787946357920,33.415135,-111.830280&amp;ei=XCUQTJ_WIsSwrAfrk8WtCQ&amp;ved=0CAQQkgMwAQ&amp;t=h&amp;z=16">Mesa Book Gallery</a> lately, have you? For shame. They've got a sale on.
<p />
It is often worthwhile to suffer the proximity of hippies at <a href="http://www.bookmans.com/our-stores/mesa">Bookmans</a>. Most of them bathe with some regularity and their Caf&eacute; usually doesn't try to kill you. Usually.
<p />   
We routinely harass the waitstaff at <a href="http://www.ilvinaio.com/">Il Vinaio</a> on Main St. They serve a damn good breakfast and throw a classy, fun and often jazz-powered dinner. Ask for the secret Hugh Jass Burger!
<p />
At the Mesa <a href="http://www.tinderboxinternational.com/store_pages/p185.htm">Tinder Box</a>, you can find some of the best tobbacco and conversation in the Valley. They've a new owner now and while it's not as comfortably informal as it once was, it remains an RKBA-friendly place and they actually try to, you know, order stuff people like. 
<p />
Trace's <a href="http://www.road-trip-bikers.com/">Road Trip Bikers</a> is a trip. On a road. For bikers.
<p />
The best coffee on Main St. can be had at <a href="http://twitter.com/BatmanCoffee">Gotham City Comics</a> (<i>"it's a graphic novel!"</i>). They even have comics and card games, and once they find someone who can alphabetize properly I'll be able to tell you more about them.  
<p />
Looking for a lower receiver here in the Valley? Try <a href="http://quentindefense.com/catalog.html">Quentin Defense</a> in Gilbert or <a href="http://www.sundevilmfg.com/pricelist.php">Sun Devil Manufacturing</a> here in Mesa.
