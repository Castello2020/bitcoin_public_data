Re: [coLinux-users] CoLinux Dead?

Message as HTML Hi David,
thanks for the information about driver signing.
In this moment I&#39;m fighting with cofs to make it more stable I can.
I would like to remember that colinux(64) now it is not the fastest way to
recompile or use max power of CPU.
VirtualBox and others can use more processors, colinux not. And they can
use virtualization tecnology that helps a lot, I think.
After all I like colinux because it is very clean and a very interesting
hack.
Paolo

&gt; &gt; Hi to all,
&gt; &gt; my advice is not to work on colinux.
&gt; &gt; In these years I worked a lot on it.
&gt; &gt; I used colinux32 at work for cross compile for arm.
&gt; &gt; Some years ago I started to work on colinux64.
&gt; &gt; It has been a very hard work.
&gt; &gt; Now the status is very advanced.
&gt; &gt; Two months ago I change PC at work and my firm gaves me a 64bit with
&gt; &gt; windows, so I cannot use colinux32 anymore.
&gt; &gt; So I began to works hardly to complete colinux64.
&gt; &gt; I the last weeks I cross compile a new arm project (linux kernel,samba,
&gt; &gt; busybox on it) without problem.
&gt; &gt; It is very very stable, I have never seen a freeze.
&gt; &gt; Maybe you ask why I do not publish it.
&gt; &gt; There are some reasons. I will not enter in the discussion.
&gt; &gt; One reason is that I&#39;d like to work quietly.
&gt; &gt; I know that when other people begin to use they will find bugs.
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to solve the bugs I found quietly. And for now I&#39;d like other

&gt; &gt; If other people build from source they can see strange behaviour.
&gt; &gt; So I ask some patiente.
&gt; &gt; I will publish colinux64 soon.
&gt; &gt; Believe in me. Everyday now I work to clean the code. So I need a brief

Message as HTML To use it I even have my laptop dual-boot with a 32-bit Windows 7.

By
 the way, the 32-bit version of coLinux is out of date for two years... I
 cannot run Arch Linux on it. Ubuntu 12.04 LTS seems to be good but I 
don&#39;t dare update. It seems that we are not only to benefit from a 
64-bit version, but also a NEW version of it.

Subject: Re: [coLinux-users] CoLinux Dead?

Just chiming in to add my encouragement to a 64bit colinux effort. Like others, I have moved to 64bit Windows and won&#39;t look back now (8GB RAM is the minimum for my development workstation). I am running Linux VMs with VirtualBox and coordinating with Vagrant, both of which are great products. But I really miss the speed and simplicity of colinux. A version that works on 64bit Windows would certainly find a place in my development workflow.

Message as HTML Just chiming in to add my encouragement to a 64bit colinux effort. Like
others, I have moved to 64bit Windows and won&#39;t look back now (8GB RAM is
the minimum for my development workstation). I am running Linux VMs with
VirtualBox and coordinating with Vagrant, both of which are great products.
But I really miss the speed and simplicity of colinux. A version that works
on 64bit Windows would certainly find a place in my development workflow.

John Scott

&gt; &gt; In these years I worked a lot on it.
&gt; &gt; I used colinux32 at work for cross compile for arm.
&gt; &gt; Some years ago I started to work on colinux64.
&gt; &gt; It has been a very hard work.
&gt; &gt; Now the status is very advanced.
&gt; &gt; Two months ago I change PC at work and my firm gaves me a 64bit with
&gt; &gt; windows, so I cannot use colinux32 anymore.
&gt; &gt; So I began to works hardly to complete colinux64.
&gt; &gt; I the last weeks I cross compile a new arm project (linux kernel,samba,
&gt; &gt; busybox on it) without problem.
&gt; &gt; It is very very stable, I have never seen a freeze.
&gt; &gt; Maybe you ask why I do not publish it.
&gt; &gt; There are some reasons. I will not enter in the discussion.
&gt; &gt; One reason is that I&#39;d like to work quietly.
&gt; &gt; I know that when other people begin to use they will find bugs.
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to solve the bugs I found quietly. And for now I&#39;d like other
&gt; &gt; people use my executables.
&gt; &gt; If other people build from source they can see strange behaviour.
&gt; &gt; So I ask some patiente.
&gt; &gt; I will publish colinux64 soon.
&gt; &gt; Believe in me. Everyday now I work to clean the code. So I need a brief
&gt; &gt; period to test it. Changes are small, but every changes can carry
&gt; &gt; instability. I know it , so I move very carefully. I need colinux64 for
&gt; &gt; my job. I think that it should be enought so you can believe in me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; One point that must be solved is the digital sign.
&gt; &gt; If anyone can sign a driver in the correct way (without F8 or other

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks to all developers that worked on colinux32.
&gt; &gt; In particular way thanks to Henry Nestler. I worked a little with him to

Hi Paolo!

That&#39;s great news.

The ReactOS project has a 64bit driver signing license and they are 
willing to sign drivers for other open source projects:

Without this, the cost for this license would be about $500 per year.

Hope this helps!

[coLinux-users] coLinux doesn't support the latest Arch Linux
From: Bolong Wang <wb@x.com.sb> - 2014-04-21 07:17:15
Attachments:
Message as HTML This post was first published on the discussion forum, however I didn&#39;t get any reply. Therefore I decided to post it to the mail list and see if any one has a solution or workaround on this issue.



I installed Arch Linux 2014.04.01 on an
 image file formatted to ext3 and attempted to boot coLinux using that 
image. I have changed /etc/fstab and replaced the corresponding lines with the cobds.

When I run the coLinux daemon I got error messages as follows:


Failed to mount /dev: No such device

Failed to mount /dev: No such device


(Yes it appeared twice, and these two lines were printed in red.)

Since indeed I have seen a filesystem called dev mounted on /dev
 in another well functioning Arch Linux in my VMware Player virtual 
machine, I think the error messages above simply meant that for some 
reason Arch Linux failed to mount that filesystem on /dev during its boot. Possibly caused by the kernel difference because coLinux&#39;s kernel is quite out of date.

The last few lines that was printed on the coLinux console were:


Determining /, Found.

Mounting /

REISERFS warning (device cobd0): sh-2021 reiserfs_fill_super: can not find reise

rfs on cobd0

EXT3-fs (cobd0): recovery required on readonly filesystem

EXT3-fs (cobd0): write access will be enabled during recovery

EXT3-fs (cobd0): recovery complete

EXT3-fs (cobd0): mounted filesystem with writeback data mode

kjournald starting.  Commit interval 5 seconds

Modules already installed.

Closing /

EXT3-fs (cobd0): using internal journal

EXT3-fs (cobd0): mounted filesystem with writeback data mode

VFS: Mounted root (ext3 filesystem) on device 117:0.

Trying to move old root to /initrd ...

kjournald starting.  Commit interval 5 seconds

/initrd does not exist. Ignored.

Unmounting old root

Trying to free ramdisk memory ... okay

Freeing unused kernel memory: 140k freed

Failed to mount /dev: No such device

Failed to mount /dev: No such device


I don&#39;t know if there is any workaround on this and the coLinux wiki is quite out of date too I got no useful information there.

Clemens,

I think your remark is superfluous and rude. While your Kickstarter idea is not necessarily a bad one, you are missing the whole point of the discussion here. Nobody was &#34;moaning&#34; or even complaining about missing features, but a developer with extra time is willing to engage in making a contribution and was actively asking the community which favourite feature they would like to see. We were merely answering his question. Not more, not less.

coLinux rulez.
I use it every time to run GNU/Linux (Debian Testing 32-bit) from Windows 
without rebooting.

Support for running 32 or 64 bit GNU/Linux distributions from a 64-bit 
Windows host.

&gt;

Like yin sun, the only thing of significance to me is 64-bit support. I am not an active user of CoLinux. That is the reason why.

64bit support is a must for me too.
All versions of Windows I use now are 64bit.

Message as HTML Hello,

It is really difficult to get that working without support from the screen
reader software. If you are interested on why, I can provide details (it
will be a long e-mail!)

You may want to try Tally-Ho and other OCR-based screen readers. It will
not be perfect but it will be better than nothing:
