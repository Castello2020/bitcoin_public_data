					<div class='e-content'><p>Saturday, July 12, there&#8217;s a big <a href="http://oaklavia.org/">open streets event</a> in <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2009/04/11/visualizing-density/">my</a> obscure flats <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate,_Oakland,_California">neighborhood</a> where Oakland, Emeryville, and Berkeley meet. A small stretch of San Pablo Avenue will be closed to cars (sadly not only human-driven cars, which would momentarily meet my <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/04/28/ban-human-drivers/">suggestion</a>). E&#8217;ville Eye has a comprehensive post about the <a href="http://evilleeye.com/in-the-neighborhood/events/emeryville-oakland-joining-forces-this-saturday-for-love-our-neighborhood-day/">event and its origins</a>.</p>
<p>There will be an <a href="http://www.oaklandurbanpaths.org/ai1ec_event/july-walk-golden-gate-district-and-oaklavia/?instance_id=188">Oakland Urban Paths walk</a> in the neighborhood during the event, during which obscurities will be related. Usually these walks are in locations with more obvious scenery (hills/stairs) and historical landmarks; I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how they address Golden Gate. Last month they walked between <a href="http://www.oaklandurbanpaths.org/2014/06/oup-walk-west-oakland/">West Oakland and downtown</a>, a historic and potentially beautiful route that currently crosses 980 twice &#8212; <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2011/12/07/occupy-980/">edit it out</a>!</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://mg.ml.vc/mgoblin_media/media_entries/37/980-freeway-proposed-deletion.jpg"/></div>
<p><b>Monday</b>, July 14 18:00-19:30 there&#8217;s a follow-on event at the Golden Gate Branch Library &#8212; an <a href="http://oaklandwiki.org/Oakland_Wiki_Events">OaklandWiki edit party</a>. I haven&#8217;t edited Oakland Wiki much yet, but I like the concept. It is one of many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LocalWiki">LocalWikis</a>, which relative to MediaWiki and Wikipedia have very few features or rules. This ought greatly lower the barrier to many more people contributing information pertinent to their local situation; perhaps someone is researching that? I&#8217;ve used the OaklandWiki to look up sources for Wikipedia articles related to Oakland and have noticed several free images uploaded to OaklandWiki that would be useful on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Saturday, July 19 11:00-16:00 there&#8217;s a Wikipedia edit event at Impact Hub in Oakland and online: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Open_Barn_Raising_2014">WikiProject Open Barn Raising 2014</a> which aims to improve Wikipedia articles about open education &#8212; a very broad and somewhat recursive (Wikipedia is an &#8220;open educational resource&#8221;, though singular doesn&#8217;t do it justice, unless perhaps made singular <em>the</em> open educational resource, but that would be an overstatement). If you&#8217;re interested in OER, Open Access, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/06/26/open-policy-reform/">open policy</a> and related tools and organizations, or would like to learn about those things <em>and</em> about editing Wikipedia, please <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Open_Barn_Raising_2014">participate</a>!</p>
<p>Tangentially, OpenHatch (<a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/12/12/oh-hanging-fruit/">my endorsement</a>) got a nice writeup of its <a href="http://campus.openhatch.org/">Open Source Comes to Campus</a> events <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/07/openhatch/">at WIRED</a>. I view these as conceptually similar to introduction to Wiki[pedia] editing events &#8212; all aim to create a welcoming space for newcomers to dive into participating in commons-based peer production &#8212; good for learning, careers, communities, and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/02/09/freedoms-commons/">society</a>.</p>

				<small>Saturday, April 26th, 2014</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<div class='e-content'><div style="padding:10px; border-style: solid; border-width: 5px; background-color:lightgray" rel="dc:source" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/without-intellectual-property-day"><a rel="cc:attributionURL" property="dc:title" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/without-intellectual-property-day">Without Intellectual Property Day</a> by <span property="cc:attributionName">Parker Higgins</span> of the EFF is quite good, and released under <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/">CC-BY</a>. Clearly deserving of adaptation. Mine below, followed by a diff.</div>
<p>April 26 is the day marked each year since 2000 by the <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/wipo">World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)</a> as &#8220;World Intellectual Property Day&#8221;, in which WIPO tries to associate its <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/03/ustr-secret-copyright-agreements-worldwide">worldwide pushes for more enclosure</a> with creativity.</p>
<p>Celebrating creativity is a good thing, but when you&#8217;re a hammer, everything looks like a nail. For the World Intellectual Property Organization, it may seem like creativity and <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/intellectual-property/the-term">&#8220;intellectual property&#8221;</a> are inextricably linked. That&#8217;s not the case. In the spirit of adding to the conversation, let&#8217;s honor all the creativity and industry that is happening <i>without</i> a dependence on a system intellectual property.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an important reason to encourage and promote creativity outside the bounds of increasingly restrictive laws: to the extent such creativity succeeds, it helps us re-imagine the range of desirable policy <i>and</i> reduces the resources available to enclosure industries to lobby for protectionism &#8212; in sum shifting what is politically possible. It&#8217;s incumbent on all of us who want to encourage creativity to continue to explore and utilize structures that reward creators without also restricting speech.</p>
<h3>Comedy, Fashion, Cooking, Magic, and More</h3>
<p>In the areas in which intellectual freedom is not typically infringed, there is tremendous innovation and consistent creativity outside of the intellectual property system. Chefs create new dishes, designers imagine new styles, comedians write new jokes, all without a legal enforcement mechanism to restrict others from learning and building on them.</p>
<p>There may be informal systems that discourage copying—the comedy community, to take one example, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/features/2014/the_humor_code/joke_theft_can_a_comedian_sue_if_someone_steals_his_material.html">will call out people</a> who are deemed to be ripping off material—but for the most part these work without expensive litigation, threats of ruinous fines, and the creation of systems of surveillance and censorship.</p>
<h3>Contributing to a Creative Commons</h3>
<p>The free software movement pioneered the practice of creating digital media that can legally and freely be shared and expanded, building a commons. The digital commons idea is being pushed in more areas than ever before, including culture, education, government, hardware design, and research. There are some projects we&#8217;re all familiar with &#8212; Wikipedia is perhaps the most prominent, creating an expansive and continuously updated encyclopedia that is freely accessible under permissive terms to the entire world.</p>
<p>Focusing on this year&#8217;s World IP Day theme of movies, there have been some impressive contributions the commons over the years. Nina Paley&#8217;s feature animation <i><a href="http://www.sitasingstheblues.com/">Sita Sings The Blues</a></i>, which she released into the public domain, has spread widely, inspired more work, and earned her money. The <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20101002/20174711259/open-source-animated-movie-shows-what-can-be-done-today.shtml">short films from the Blender Foundation</a> have demonstrated cutting-edge computer graphics made with free software and, though they&#8217;ve sometimes been on <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140406/07212626819/sony-youtube-take-down-sintel-blenders-open-source-creative-commons-crowdfunded-masterpiece.shtml">the receiving end of bogus copyright takedowns</a>, have been watched many millions of times.</p>
<h3>Kickstarting and Threshold Pledges</h3>
<p>Finally, crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indie-Go-Go have made a major splash in the last few years as another fundraising model that can complement, or even replace, copyright exclusivity. These platforms build on theoretical framework laid out by scholars like John Kelsey and Bruce Schneier in <a href="https://www.schneier.com/paper-street-performer.html">the influential &#8220;Street Performer Protocol&#8221; paper</a>, which set out to devise an alternative funding system for public domain works. But most crowdfunded works are not in the commons, indicating an need for better <a href=http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/08/10/street-patrons-missing-coordination-protocol/">coordination of street patrons</a>.</p>
<p>Looking at movies in particular: Kickstarter alone has <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/a-big-day-for-film">enabled hundreds of millions of dollars of pledges</a>, hundreds of theatrical releases, and seven Oscar-nominated films (including <i>Inocente</i>, winner of the Best Documentary Short category). Blender Foundation is currently crowdfunding its first feature length film, <em><a href="http://gooseberry.blender.org/">Gooseberry</a></em>.</p>
<h3>***</h3>
<p>The conceit of copyright and other &#8220;intellectual property&#8221; systems is that they can be calibrated to promote the progress of science and the useful arts. But the reality of these systems is corruption and rent seeking, not calibration. The cost is not just less creativity and innovation, but less freedom and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/01/30/tech-wealth-ip/">equality</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear from real world examples that other systems can achieve the goal of promoting creativity, progress, and innovation. We must continue to push for both practice and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/02/09/freedoms-commons/#regulators">policy that favors these systems</a>, ultimately rendering &#8220;intellectual property&#8221; a baffling anachronism. In a good future, a policy-oriented celebration of creativity and innovaion would be called World Intellectual Freedom Day.</p>

					<div class='e-content'><p>I thoroughly enjoyed <span title="dias-quora">memesteader</span> Gordon Mohr&#8217;s <a href="https://medium.com/p/fa4482bca3ef">Quora &#038; Wikipedia: Might one ever bail out the other? Futures of ‘Qworum’ or ‘WiQipedia’</a> which posits two futures in which the sites respectively decline mostly due to internal failure &#8212; essentially not adequately dealing with spam and unscrupulous behavior in both cases, though the spam and behavior is different for each.</p>
<p>Both futures seem plausible to me, inclusive of the decline and bail out in each. I also take the medium term absolute decline and death of Quora and steep relative decline of Wikimedia as likely. This relative assessment isn&#8217;t a knock on Quora &#8212; it and many others waiting in the wings can get big or fail &#8212; commons-based projects don&#8217;t have much experience in trying to do that (but need to, or find some other way to maintain long-term competitiveness).</p>
<p>Of course &#8220;waiting in the wings&#8221; is an understatement: I suspect the decline of both Quora and Wikimedia will be less due to internal failure than to being outcompeted by new entrants. Mohr has <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2011/01/04/delete/#infinithree">long</a> been rumored to be working on one, but I imagine there must be many entrepreneurs dreaming of taking a chunk of Wikipedia traffic. I <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/05/03/a-kill-hollyweb-plan/">enjoy</a> the <a href="http://ycombinator.com/rfs9.html">Kill Hollywood</a> request for startups, but Kill Wikipedia seems like a more plausible target for VC-term investment. (My <em>preference</em> is to target proprietary monopolies for destruction through competition, replacing them with commons; long ago I even imagined a financially leveraged/risk-seeking <a href="http://extropians.weidai.com/extropians.1Q00/1118.html">approach</a>, but more feasible ones badly needed still.)</p>
<p>Go read and enjoy Mohr&#8217;s <a href="https://medium.com/p/fa4482bca3ef">post</a>, take it at least semi-seriously, and reflect on the <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/03/28/ip-post-scarcity/">future</a>. Doing so makes me pine for something which does not yet exist: <a href="http://blog.oddhead.com/2008/12/22/what-is-and-what-good-is-a-combinatorial-prediction-market/">combinatorial prediction markets</a> for everything.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t looked at Quora in some time. I note that it still requires logging in to read, but has added Google &#8212; previously Facebook login (or not) was the only choice. There have been at least semi-serious explorations of a Wikimedia general Q&#038;A sister project, but I&#8217;m not sure if any of them are listed in <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_new_projects">project proposals</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<div class='e-content'><p>As far as I know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Daniel_Mietchen">Daniel Mietchen</a> does the very best work to <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2014/01/15/wikimedia-and-open-access/">bridge Wikimedia sites and freely licensed Open Access research</a> (previous <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/01/19/public-domain-wins-copyright/">motivated link</a>), making both much more valuable. Others doing or to do comparable or better work: I&#8217;m sorry I don&#8217;t yet know of it, and I thank you.</p>
<p>Mietchen has grander ideas for making research inputs, outputs, and collaboration more open and&#8230;collaborative. I wrote about his <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2011/12/15/original-research-pedia/">Encyclopedia of Original Research</a> proposal (sadly unfunded as yet) a couple years ago.</p>
<p>Now as part of the Knight News Challenge he has a <a href="https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/submissions/opening-up-research-proposals">proposal for opening up research proposals</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ideas are drivers of change, in research as much as in society at large. Current research practice is to hide ideas as long as possible and to reveal them only in formal publications that &#8220;count&#8221; in research evaluation contexts. We want to change that.</p>
<p>Many ideas are lost in the current closed system, and so are opportunities to collaborate and improve those few that are actually being worked on. We propose to elaborate mechanisms that would allow a transition from the current secretive model to one in which sharing research ideas is the default and seen as an invitation for collaboration, for accelerating and improving research rather than as a breach of private property.</p></blockquote>
<p>The brief proposal is packed with ideas for making that happen (I made some small suggestions in the comments, but everything good was latent or implied before). One conceptual thing I like about the proposal is that it sets up a commons-based information revelation regime; the case for intellectual property as a revelation regime may seem <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/03/28/ip-post-scarcity/">quaint</a>, but there&#8217;s nothing like a wildly better commons-based system to finally demolish that notion.</p>
<p>It appears there are 11 days left in the public feedback stage of the Knight News Challenge. I encourage you to <a href="https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/submissions/opening-up-research-proposals">read the proposal, post feedback, and applaud</a>.</p>
<p><b>Update 20140409:</b> I&#8217;m now an officious collaborator on this proposal. Hopefully that strengthens (commitment) rather than weakens (conflict) my endorsement of the proposal.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<div class='e-content'><p><a href="https://medium.com/p/7645a4bf8a2">David Flanagan</a>, latest making claim I&#8217;ve read many times:</p>
<blockquote><p>Without Mozilla, there would have been no Firefox, and the internet would be very different today.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2014/03/24/a-return-to-founders-as-mozilla-moves-forward/">Mitchell Baker</a> in only a few more words included a combined mechanism and outcome:</p>
<blockquote><p>We moved the desktop and browsing environments to a much more open place, with far more options and control available to individuals.</p></blockquote>
<p>Baker further explained Mozilla aims to make an analogous difference in the computing environment of today and the future:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today we live in a different online era. This era combines desktop, mobile devices, cloud services, big data and a social layer. It is feature-rich, highly centralized, and focused on a few giant organizations that exert control over almost all aspects of the experience. Today’s computing environment is deeply in need of an open, exciting alternative that shows what the Open Web brings to this setting — something built on parts including Firefox OS, WebGL, asm.js, and the many other innovations being developed at Mozilla. It is comparable to the desktop computing environment we set out to revolutionize when we started Mozilla.</p>
<p>Mozilla needs to bring a similar scope of change to the new computing era. Once again, Mozilla needs to break down the walled gardens of online life and bring openness and opportunity to all. Once again, we have the chance to build products and communities in a way that no one else will.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Baker&#8217;s post announced Brendan Eich as CEO, Flanagan lays out some information following Eich&#8217;s <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/04/04/empowered-mozilla/">resignation</a>. That crisis presumably changed nothing about evaluations of Mozilla&#8217;s previous impact, nor its plans for analogous future impact. The crisis just provided an opportunity for many to repeat such evaluations and plans. This post is my idiosyncratic exploitation of the opportunity.)</p>
<p>Those are important claims and plans, and I tend to strongly agree with them. My logic, in brief:</p>
<ul>
<li>there&#8217;s a lot of scope for the net (and <a href="gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/02/09/freedoms-commons/">society at large</a>) to be substantially more or <a href="gondwanaland.com/mlog/2006/08/07/aolternative-history/">less</a> &#8220;open&#8221; than it is or <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/03/28/ip-post-scarcity/">might be</a> due to relatively small knowledge policy and knowledge economy changes;</li>
<li>there&#8217;s a lot of scope for commons-based projects to push the knowledge economy (and largely as an <a href="gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/05/01/product-shape-policy/">effect</a>, knowledge policy) in the direction of &#8220;open&#8221;;</li>
<li>due to network effects and economies of scale, <a href="gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/10/23/billion-dollar-open-source-organizations/">huge</a> commons-based projects are needed to realize this potential for pushing society in an &#8220;open&#8221; direction;</li>
<li>Mozilla is one of a small number of such huge commons-based projects, and its main products have and will be in positions with lots of leverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Independent of my logic (which of course I <a href="gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/01/10/annual-thematic-doubt/">doubt</a> and welcome criticism of) for agreeing with them, I think claims about Mozilla&#8217;s past and potential future impact are important enough to be criticized and refined rather than <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/09/15/question-software-freedom-day/">suffering</a> the unremitting bludgeoning of obscurity or triviality.</p>
<p>How could one begin to evaluate how much and what sort of difference Mozilla, primarily through Firefox, has made? Some things to look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>other free/open source software browser projects;</li>
<li>competition among proprietary browsers;</li>
<li>differences between Firefox and proprietary browsers in developing and implementing web standards;</li>
<li>all aspects of Mozilla performance vs. comparable (Mozilla is different in many respects, but surely amenable to many tools of organizational evaluation and comparison) organizations;</li>
<li>2nd order effects of a superior (for a period, and competitive otherwise) free/open source browser, e.g., viability of free desktop (though never achieving significant market share, must be responsible for huge increases in consumer surplus due through constraint on proprietary pricing and behavior) and inspiration for other open source projects, demonstration of feasibility of commons-based competition in mass market.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that such questions are inadequate for characterizing the impact of Mozilla, but surely they would help inform such characterization. If those are the wrong questions, or the wrong sort of questions, what are the right ones? Has anyone, in any field, taken evaluation of Mozilla&#8217;s differential impact beyond the Baker quote above? I&#8217;d love to read about how the net would have been different without Firefox, and how we might expect the success or failure of <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/03/29/mozilla-equality/#other">new</a> Mozilla initiatives to produce different worlds.</p>
<p>These kinds of questions are also important (or at a minimum, interesting to me) for other commons-based initiatives, e.g., <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/08/wikipedias-economic-values/">Wikimedia and Creative Commons</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<div class='e-content'><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lemley">Mark Lemley</a>&#8216;s new paper <em><a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=2413974">IP in a World Without Scarcity</a></em> provides good overviews of the case &#8220;that on the Internet, we increasingly get creativity in spite of, rather than because of, IP law&#8221; &#8212; the exclusivity incentive for creation story, if it were ever true, is drowning in non-exclusive creativity, and theories that distribution and revelation also require an exclusivity incentive also seem quaint given the Internet &#8212; and of 3D printing, general purpose robotics, and synthetic biology, which &#8220;share two essential characteristics with the Internet: they radically reduce the cost of production and distribution of things, and they separate the informational content of those things (the design) from their manufacture.&#8221; Thus, Lemley argues, economics and policy need increasingly to grapple with an end to scarcity, IP will be increasingly important, and we can draw lessons from the Internet about how this all will and should play out.</p>
<p>The paper is a quick read at 55 double-spaced pages. I recommend it to anyone interested in near future technology and policy. The paper&#8217;s final sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thinking about such questions has been the province of science fiction authors, but understanding what a post-scarcity economy will look like is the great task of economics for the next century.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lemley cites two SF books very familiar to many readers: <em>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</em> by Cory Doctorow (my <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2005/12/28/down-and-out-with-the-macxs/">positive review</a>) and <em>The Diamond Age: Or, A Young Lady’s Illustrated Primer</em> by Neal Stephenson, which just a few days ago I exploited in a private communication: &#8220;&#8230;the primer is an interactive learning notebook which adapts as the owner learns, informing a generation of geeks’ vision of education and development. Such tools are increasingly feasible. Will all humans have full access to, and ability to participate in the development of such tools? Only if they are developed in the commons, which will only happen with intentional action.&#8221; That&#8217;s probably a good segue into my disagreements with and additional idiosyncratic observations about <em>IP in a World Without Scarcity</em>.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>By IP, Lemley means intellectual property: mostly copyright, patent, trademark. That has been and will be increasingly a terrible frame for thinking about policy. It gives away the <s>farm</s>future to owners of the past, who, as Lemley notes &#8220;will fight the death of scarcity&#8221; as they have fought the Internet &#8212; with more criminalization, more lawsuits, more attempts to fundamentally alter technologies in order to protect their rents. This seems rather suboptimal given that we know the theory upon which IP rests is largely bunk. The alternative, assuming we still only wish to maximize innovation, is to make innovation policy the frame. This makes turning the enclosure dial up or down a sideshow, and pulls in non-enclosure incentives and a host of more indirect and probably much more important determinants of innovation, e.g., education and governance.</p>
<p>The paper provides a couple reasons for focusing on the enclosure version of IP (Lemley doesn&#8217;t need any reason; he&#8217;s an IP scholar, and though I wish such people would reconceptualize themselves as commons scholars, I have no expectation; in any case the &#8220;reasons&#8221; are my reading). First, the framing isn&#8217;t as harmful as I made it out to be, because IP owners&#8217; fight against the Internet &#8220;didn&#8217;t work. Copyright infringement remains rampant&#8221; and against other democratizing technologies, &#8220;IP owners will (probably) lose that fight.&#8221; But winning isn&#8217;t binary, nor is the continued existence of rampant copyright infringement a good indicator.</p>
<p>Given that network effects are highly relevant for many kinds of knowledge products &#8212; a tool or experience is much more valuable if other people can be expected to know it &#8212; a significant level of piracy can be <a href="http://works.bepress.com/ariel_katz/3/">profit-maximizing for an IP rent collector</a>. Better indicators might be the collapse of profits from IP rents (the movie industry <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140328/11442826721/piracy-continues-killing-movie-business-to-new-record-highs.shtml">continues to grow</a>, and while the recorded music industry has declined from its peak, this is nothing like an icehouse collapse, and many other IP rent sectors continue to grow) and the displacement of IP rent collectors as the marketers the dominant knowledge products of the age by other entities better adapted to a world in which fighting against the Internet doesn&#8217;t work (the mass and high-status markets are dominated by IP rent collectors in nearly all fields, exceptions being encyclopedias and certain kinds of infrastructure software). These might be minor, highly debatable (maybe the music industry will soon recommence a full collapse, be joined by movies, both displaced by crowdfunding and crowdmarketing; I doubt it given the properties controlled by IP rent collectors and other entities&#8217; unchanged desperation to cut unfavorable deals with them) quibbles, if the IP owners&#8217; &#8220;losing&#8221; fight against the Internet hadn&#8217;t significantly damaged the Internet.</p>
<p><span id="internet"></span>But the Internet has been damaged by the IP owners&#8217; fight. Absent an academic characterization of how significant that damage is (which I would <em>love</em> to read), here are some of the ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chilling effect on P2P research, result: more centralization;</li>
<li>Services police user content; expensive, barrier to entry, result: more centralization, near monopoly platforms;</li>
<li>Services cut rare and unfavorable deals with IP owners, result: same;</li>
<li>Innovative services fail to cut deals, or sustainable deals, with IP owners, result: less innovation, more Internet as TV;</li>
<li>Monopoly abets monopoly; creates opportunities for bundling monopolies, result: threat to net neutrality;</li>
<li>Copyright-based censorship provides cover for all kinds of political censorship, result: political censors have additional justification, doing what Hollywood does;</li>
<li>All of above centralization and monopoly makes dominant entities a target for compromise, result: mass surveillance and non-state cybercrime abetted;</li>
<li>Our imagination and expectation of what the Internet makes possible is diminished, result: DRM TV and radio and silos organized for spying are seen as the norm, information organized for public benefit such as Wikipedia, unusual; this flipping of democratic hopes for the Internet, a <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2006/08/07/aolternative-history/">partial AOL scenario</a>, is collateral damage from the IP owners&#8217; war on the Internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar damage will be done to the potential of new technologies with Internet-like characteristics (in addition to those discussed in the paper, others add the Internet of Things, distributed energy generation, and educational technologies, e.g., Jeremy Rifkin in his new book <em>The Zero Marginal Cost Society</em>, which I plan to review soon) by incumbents. This makes Lemley&#8217;s policy recommendations seem overly tentative and timid:</p>
<blockquote><p>[It] is hard to translate this skepticism into immediate policy prescriptions, both because the whole point is that the need for IP will be sensitive to individual industry characteristics and because the technologies I am discussing are still in their infancy [...] &#8220;we should resist the tendency to expand IP reflexively to meet every new technological challenge&#8221; [...] &#8220;IP owners should not be allowed to reach beyond suing infringers and seek to shut down or modify the technology itself&#8221; [...] &#8220;IP law needs to make it easier for creators to opt out of the IP regime.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>IP rent collectors will not hold off protecting their interests pending idealized analysis of more fully developed technologies. The damage they do will be built into another generation of technology and society, with IP scholars and activists left to worry that policy is contrary to evidence and to take <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2011/12/12/anti-sopa-commons/">rearguard actions</a> to protect the level of openness they&#8217;ve become accustomed to, but fail to imagine what would have been possible had the stranglehold of IP rent collectors been broken. Just like the Internet today. I&#8217;ll come back to less timid and more proactive policy response in a bit.</p>
<p>Second reason for focus on the enclosure version of IP, the usual &#8212; big budget movies (and regulated pharma, mentioned earlier in the paper):</p>
<blockquote><p>There is still a role for IP on the Internet. There are some works that are so costly to create even in the digital world that they are unlikely to be made without effective IP protection. Big-budget movies and video games cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make. No amount of creative fire will drive someone who doesn’t have hundreds of millions of dollars to make Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy. They need corporate backing, and the corporate backers need a revenue stream. But in the Internet era those works are increasingly the the exception, not the rule.</p></blockquote>
<p>My <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/01/01/counterfactual-public-domain/">usual response</a> &#8212; we should allow enclosure of our freedom, equality, and the democratic potential of the Internet in order to ensure an ongoing supply of spectacle provided in the same way it has for decades? Spectacle over freedom, <em>really?</em> Of course the &#8220;reason&#8221; is far more pessimal than that, as the cost of producing and distributing spectacle is going down fast, as is the cost of coordinating distributed patrons who want product, not rent collection. Further, because culture is also so dominated by network effects, we&#8217;ll all love whatever spectacle is produced, whether it took <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/03/23/gooseberry-empathy/">15 or 500 months of work per minute</a> of spectacle. It&#8217;s not as insane to contemplate threatening liberal values in order to get new drugs as it is to get new movies &#8212; but then considering <a href="http://acawiki.org/A_Prize_System_as_a_Partial_Solution_to_the_Health_Crisis_in_the_Developing_World">non-enclosure mechanisms</a> for developing and evaluating new drugs, and the issues of access and equality are more pressing&#8230;</p>
<p>More Lemley:</p>
<blockquote><p>IP is essentially a form of government regulation. The government restricts entry into the market, or alternatively controls the price at which that entry can occur, in order to serve valuable social ends. But regulation is not a moral entitlement or something that we must take for granted. In the past, government regulated all sorts of industries – railroads, trucking, electric power, gas, telephones – because it could not see given the economics of those industries how a free market could produce socially optimal results. But in a surprising number of cases, when we deregulated those industries we found that the market could indeed find a way to supply goods we thought would be provided only with government rule-making. IP is no different in this respect than any other form of regulation. Regulation as a whole shouldn’t disappear, but regulation of particular industries often turns out to be a reflexive response to a failure of imagination, something we do because we have done it for so long that we cannot imagine how a market in that industry could function without it.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is certainly superior to the rights/owner/property characterization inherent in IP &#8212; it recasts &#8220;owners&#8221; as beneficiaries of regulation &#8212; and I think implicitly makes the case for switching one&#8217;s frame from intellectual property to innovation policy. That leads us to what the goal of &#8220;innovation policy&#8221; regulation ought be, and sufficiently proactive policies to achieve that. Should the goal be to maximize &#8220;innovation&#8221;, &#8220;creativity&#8221;, the &#8220;progress of science and useful arts&#8221;, or the like? It would be a huge improvement to sideline enclosure as the primary mechanism and retain the same top objective. But even that improvement would be short sighted, given how systematically innovation policy regulation has and will increasingly shape society. A success of imagination would be to make freedom and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/02/27/shaver-copyright-inequality/">equality</a> the top objectives of and constraints on innovation policy, and only then maximize innovation. The innovations generated by a free and equal society are the ones I want. Others are to be <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2011/11/16/we-deserve-sopa/">gawked at</a> with dismay and guilt.</p>
<p><span id="procommons"></span>On proactive policies required, in brief the are pro-commons policies, and I <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/02/09/freedoms-commons/">return to Benkler</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Regulators concerned with fostering innovation may better direct their efforts toward providing the institutional tools that would help thousands of people to collaborate without appropriating their joint product, making the information they produce freely available rather than spending their efforts to increase the scope and sophistication of the mechanisms for private appropriation of this public good as they now do.</p>
<p>That we cannot fully understand a phenomenon does not mean that it does not exist. That a seemingly growing phenomenon refuses to fit our longstanding perceptions of how people behave and how economic growth occurs counsels closer attention, not studied indifference and ignorance. Commons-based peer production presents a fascinating phenomenon that could allow us to tap substantially underutilized reserves of human creative effort. It is of central importance that we not squelch peer production, but that we create the institutional conditions needed for it to flourish.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which implies that commons scholarship ought displace intellectual property scholarship (except as a historical investigation of commons malgovernance).</p>
<p>I realize that I haven&#8217;t provided any specific pro-commons policy recommendations in this post, nevermind any that are especially pertinent in a world with less scarcity. I&#8217;m deeply skeptical that lower, different costs substantially change innovation policy or knowledge commons arguments &#8212; the same ones have recurred since at least the <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130503/17414322946/discussions-abolition-patents-uk-france-germany-netherlands-1869.shtml">1800s</a> &#8212; and am extremely doubtful that the usual assumption that digital networks fundamentally change desirable policy (or here, that further technologies with digital network like characterizations further change desirable policy) is true or non-harmful &#8212; these assumptions give away (legitimize) the past to those who now use it to control the future. Some short term and narrow but valuable <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/02/18/reclaim-the-commons-framing/">pro-commons policy suggestions</a> arising from the Wikimedia movement; the free software movement offers other suggestions, if we take some of its practices as <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/01/31/copyleft-regulates/">prototypes for regulation</a> enforced by mechanisms other than copyright holder whim, more powerful and better aligned with its claims of software freedom as a human right.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>A few final quotes from Lemley&#8217;s <em>IP in a World Without Scarcity</em>, first two from footnotes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The challenge posed to copyright by collective production sites like Wikipedia is not just one of the need for incentives. Collective production challenges the whole concept of authorship.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, and as I keep repeating effective <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/05/01/product-shape-policy/">product competition</a> from the commons (such as Wikipedia) re-imagines the range of desirable policy <em>and</em> reduces the resources available to enclosure industries to lobby for protectionism &#8212; in sum shifting what is politically possible.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is possible that creators create in hopes of being one of the few superstars whose work is actually rewarded by copyright law. It is well known that people systematically overvalue the prospect of a large but unlikely reward; that’s why they buy lottery tickets. Some scholars have suggested that the same effect may be at work in IP. But if so, the incentive on which we rely is, as Kretschmer puts it, “based on a systematic cognitive mistake.” In effect, we are coaxing works out of these creators by lying to them about their chances of getting paid.</p></blockquote>
<p>This has long struck me as being the case. The question is then (in addition to considerations above), do we really want a culture dominated by fools and sell-outs?</p>
<blockquote><p>A world without scarcity requires a major rethinking of economics, much as the decline of the agrarian economy did in the 19th century. How will our economy function in a world in which most of the things we produce are cheap or free? We have lived with scarcity for so long that it is hard even to begin to think about the transition to a post-scarcity economy. IP has allowed us to cling to scarcity as an organizing principle in a world that no longer demands it. But it will no more prevent the transition than agricultural price supports kept us all farmers. We need a post-scarcity economics, one that accepts rather than resists the new opportunities technology will offer us. Developing that economics is the great task of the 21st century.</p></blockquote>
<p>But we should aim for much better than the travesty of developed country agricultural policy (even before considering its baneful intersection with IP) as the legacy of this transition! But the consequences of continued capture of innovation policy have the potential to be far worse. Even if few are employed in information industries, there is no transition on the way to displace arranging information as the dominant mode of the economy (however measured; previous modes being hunting/gathering, agriculture, and industry); if the mode is largely controlled by rent collectors, the result could be a very <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2007/12/04/the-issue/">unfree</a> and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/01/30/tech-wealth-ip/">unequal</a> society &#8212; perhaps on the order of pre-industrial agricultural societies.</p>

					<div class='e-content'><p>Today folks seem to be celebrating the 25th anniversary of a <a href="http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">1989 proposal</a> for what is now the web &#8212; implementation released to the public in <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/12/17/greatest-month-in-history/">August, 1991</a>.</p>
<p>Q&#038;A with web inventor Timothy Berners-Lee: <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57620198-93/tim-berners-lee-25-years-on-the-web-still-needs-work-q-a/">25 years on, the Web still needs work</a>.</p>
<p>The web is pretty great, much better than easily imagined <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2006/08/07/aolternative-history/">alternatives</a>. Three broad categories it could improve in:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Universality.</b> All humans should be able to access the web, and this should be taken to include being able to publish, collaborate, do business, and run software on the web, in any manner, in any language or other interface. Presently, billions aren&#8217;t on the net at all, activity outside of a handful of large services is very expensive (in money, expertise, or marketing), and machine translation and accessibility are very limited.</li>
<li><b>Security.</b> All of the above, securely, without having to understand anything technical about security, and with lots of technical and cultural guards against technical and non-technical attacks of all kinds.</li>
<li><b>Resilience.</b> All of the above, with minimal interruption and maximal recovery from disaster, from individual to planetary scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three pet outcomes I wish for:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Collective wisdom.</b> The web helps make better decisions, at all scales.</li>
<li><b>Commons dominance.</b> Most top sites are free-as-in-freedom. Presently, only Wikipedia (#5) is.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/02/09/freedoms-commons/">Freedom, equality, etc.</a></b></li>
</ul>
<p>Two quotes from the Berners-Lee Q&#038;A that are on the right track:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Getting a nice user interface to a secure system is the art of the century.</p>
<p>Copyright law is terrible.

				<div class="entry">
					<div class='e-content'><p>First, two excerpts of my previous posts to explain my rationale for this one. <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/05/09/econommons/">10 months ago</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wonder the extent to which reform of any institution, dominant or otherwise, away from capture and enclosure, toward the benefit and participation of all its constituents, might be characterized as commoning?</p>
<p>Whatever the scope of commoning, we don’t know how to do it very well. How to provision and govern resources, even knowledge, without exclusivity and control, can boggle the mind. I suspect there is tremendous room to increase the freedom and equality of all humans through learning-by-doing (and researching) more activities in a commons-orientated way. One might say our lack of knowledge about the commons is a tragedy.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/01/03/how-to-be-a-democrat/">26</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Other than envious destruction of power (the relevant definition and causes of which being tenuous, making effective action much harder) and gradual construction of alternatives, how can one be a democrat? I suspect more accurate information and more randomness are important — I’ll sometimes express this very specifically as enthusiasm for futarchy and sortition — but I’m also interested in whatever small increases in accurate information and randomness might be feasible, at every scale and granularity — global governance to small organizations, event probabilities to empirically validated practices.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<div style="float:right;padding:10px"><a href="http://thegovlab.org/"><img src="http://thegovlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/logo.png"/></a></div>
<p>I read about the Governance Lab @ NYU (GovLab) in a <a href="https://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-government/2014-March/003417.html">forward</a> of a <a href="http://thegovlab.org/new-research-network-to-study-and-design-innovative-ways-of-solving-public-problems/">press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Combining empirical research with real-world experiments, the Research Network will study what happens when governments and institutions open themselves to diverse participation, pursue collaborative problem-solving, and seek input and expertise from a range of people.</p></blockquote>
<p>That sounded interesting, perhaps not deceivingly &#8212; as I browsed the site, open tabs accumulated. Notes on some of those follow. </p>
<p>GovLab&#8217;s <a href="http://thegovlab.org/smarter-governance-research-agenda/">hypothesis</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When institutions open themselves to diverse participation and collaborative problem solving, they become more effective and the decisions they make are more legitimate.</p></blockquote>
<p>I like this coupling of effectiveness and legitimacy. Another way of saying <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/09/politics-isnt-a.html">politics isn&#8217;t about policy</a> is that governance isn&#8217;t about effectiveness, but about legitimizing power. I used to scoff at the concept of legitimacy, and my mind still boggles at arrangements passing as &#8220;legitimate&#8221; that enable mass murder, torture, and incarceration. But our arrangements are incredibly path dependent and hard to improve; now I try to charitably consider legitimacy a very useful shorthand for arrangements that have some widely understood and accepted level of effectiveness. Somewhat less charitably: at least they&#8217;ve survived, and one can do a lot worse than copying survivors. Arrangements based on open and diverse participation and collaborative problem solving are hard to legitimate: not only do they undermine what legitimacy is often really about, it is hard to see how they can work in theory or practice, relative to hierarchical command and control. Explicitly tackling effectiveness and legitimacy separately and together might be more useful than assuming one implies the other, or ignoring one of them. Refutation of the hypothesis would also be useful: many people could refocus on increasing the effectiveness and legitimacy of hierarchical, closed systems.</p>
<p><a href="http://thegovlab.org/if-only-we-knew/">If We Only Knew</a>:<br />
<blockquote>What are the essential questions that if answered could help accelerate the transformation of how we solve public problems and provide for public goods?</p></blockquote>
<p>The list of questions isn&#8217;t that impressive, but not bad either. The idea that such a list should be articulated is great. Every project ought maintain such a list of essential questions pertinent to the project&#8217;s ends!</p>
<p><a href="http://thegovlab.org/proposal-13-for-icann-provide-an-adjudication-function-by-establishing-citizen-juries/">Proposal 13 for ICANN: Provide an Adjudication Function by Establishing “Citizen” Juries</a> (emphasis in original):</p>
<blockquote><p>As one means to enhance accountability – through greater engagement with the global public during decision-making and through increased oversight of ICANN officials after the fact – ICANN could <em><strong>pilot the use of randomly assigned small public groups of individuals to whom staff and volunteer officials would be required to report over a given time period</strong></em> (i.e. “citizen” juries). The Panel proposes citizen juries rather than a court system, namely because these juries are lightweight, highly democratic and require limited bureaucracy. It is not to the exclusion of other proposals for adjudicatory mechanisms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone interested in random selection and juries has to be at least a little interesting, and on the right track. Or so I&#8217;ve thought since hearing about the idea of <a href="http://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Chapter_13.html">science courts</a> and whatever my first encounter with sortition advocacy was (forgotten, but see <a href="http://www.internauta-online.com/2014/02/an-italian-road-to-randomcracy/">most recent</a>), both long ago.</p>
<p><a href="http://thegovlab.org/idea-flow-1-0-from-academy-into-action/">Quote in a quote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>“The largest factor in predicting group intelligence was the equality of conversational turn-taking.”</p></blockquote>
<p>What does that say about:
<ul>
<li>Mailing lists and similar fora used by projects and organizations, often dominated by loudmouths (to say nothing of meetings dominated by high-status talkers);</li>
<li>Mass media, including social media dominated by power law winners?</li>
</ul>
<p>Surely it isn&#8217;t pretty for the intelligence of relevant groups. But perhaps impetus to actually implement measures often discussed when a forum gets out of control (e.g., volume or flamewars) such as automated throttling, among many other things. On the bright side, there could be lots of low hanging fruit. On the dim side, I&#8217;m surely making extrapolations (second bullet especially) unsupported by research I haven&#8217;t read!</p>
<p><a href="http://thegovlab.org/coordinating-the-commons-diversity-dynamics-in-open-collaborations/">Coordinating the Commons: Diversity &#038; Dynamics in Open Collaborations</a>, excerpt from a dissertation:<br />
<blockquote>Learning from Wikipedia’s successes and failures can help researchers and designers understand how to support open collaborations in other domains — such as Free/Libre Open Source Software, Citizen Science, and Citizen Journalism. [...] To inquire further, I have designed a new editor peer support space, the Wikipedia Teahouse, based on the findings from my empirical studies. The Teahouse is a volunteer-driven project that provides a welcoming and engaging environment in which new editors can learn how to be productive members of the Wikipedia community, with the goal of increasing the number and diversity of newcomers who go on to make substantial contributions to Wikipedia.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I like the title, cf. <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/12/09/scc-cc-40/">commons coordination</a> (though I was primarily thinking of inter-project/movement coordination);</li>
<li><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/12/12/oh-hanging-fruit/">OpenHatch<em>y</em></a>;</li>
<li>I like the further inquiry&#8217;s usefulness for research and the researched community;</li>
<li>Improving the effectiveness of mass collaboration is <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/02/09/freedoms-commons/#extrapolation">important</a>, including for its policy effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Back to the press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>Support for the Network from Google.org will be used to build technology platforms to solve problems more openly and to run agile, real-world, empirical experiments with institutional partners such as governments and NGOs to discover what can enhance collaboration and decision-making in the public interest.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope those technology platforms will be open to <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/10/07/open-data-nuance/">audit and improvement by the public</a>, i.e., free/open source software. GovLab&#8217;s site being under an open license (CC-BY-SA) could be a small positive indicator (perhaps not rising to the level of an essential question for anyone, but I do wonder how release and use of &#8220;content&#8221; or &#8220;data&#8221; under an open license correlates with release and use of open source software, if there&#8217;s causality in either direction, and if there could be interventions that would usefully reinforce any such).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad that NGOs are a target. Seems it ought be easier to adopt and spread governance innovation among NGOs (and businesses) than among governments, if only because there&#8217;s more turnover. But I&#8217;m not impressed. I imagine this could be due, among other things, to my ignorance: perhaps over a reasonable time period non-state governance has improved more rapidly than state governance, or to non-state governance being even less about effectiveness and more about power than is state governance, or to governance being really unimportant for survival, thus a random walk.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Something related I&#8217;ll never get around to blogging separately: the 2 year old <a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=2012489">New Ambiguity of &#8216;Open Government&#8217;</a> (<a href="http://acawiki.org/The_New_Ambiguity_of_'Open_Government'">summary</a>), concerning the danger of allowing term to denote a government that publishes data, even merely politically insensitive data around service provision, rather than politically sensitive transparency and ability to demand accountability. I agree about the danger. The authors recommend maintaining distinctions between accountability, service provision, and adaptability of data. I find these distinctions aren&#8217;t often made explicit, and perhaps they shouldn&#8217;t be: it&#8217;d be a pain. But on the activist side, I think most really are pushing for politically sensitive transparency (and some focused on data about service provision might fairly argue such is often deeply political); certainly none want open data to be a means of openwashing. For one data point, I recommend the <a href="http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-2/oakland-and-the-search-for-the-open-city/">Oakland chapter of <em>Beyond Transparency</em><em></em></a>. Finally, <a href="http://stopsecretcontracts.org/">Stop Secret Contracts</a> seems like a <a href="http://blog.okfn.org/2014/02/27/stop-secret-contracts-new-global-campaign-launched/">new</a> campaign entirely oriented toward politically sensitive transparency and accountability rather than data release.

					<div class='e-content'><p><img src="http://mg.ml.vc/mgoblin_media/media_entries/36/copyright-inequality.png" style="float:right;padding:10px" alt="copyright inequality icon"/>I really enjoyed <em><a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=2398373">Copyright and Inequality</a></em>, a new paper by <a href="http://leashaver.net/">Lea Shaver</a> forthcoming in the Washington University Law Review &#8212; enough to attempt a <a href="http://acawiki.org/Copyright_and_Inequality">summary</a> on first read, and to read a second time, aloud, in hope that some people who would never read a 52 page paper might still <a href="https://archive.org/details/LeaShaverCopyrightAndInequality">hear</a> its message.<br />
<iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/LeaShaverCopyrightAndInequality" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
The paper is highly readable, a large part of it (&#8220;A Case Study in Book Hunger&#8221;, numbered pages 9-22, about books, languages, and the socio-economics of South Africa) of general interest, barely mentioning copyright at all &#8212; though if you start by reading that section, hopefully you&#8217;ll then read the rest of the paper to find out how copyright is implicated. May the remainder of this post be a complement.</p>
<h3 id="ip">Inequality Promotion</h3>
<p>To put it crudely, <em>Copyright and Inequality</em> mostly concerns copyright&#8217;s role in keeping the poor poor, rather than its role in <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/30/economics-commons-conference-knowledge/#map">concentrating</a> <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/05/07/ip-ceo-pay-inequality/">wealth</a>. The latter seems even less studied than the former, but the former seems more important, unless you consider rule by plutocracy the most urgent issue in the world.</p>
<p>In the category of keeping the poor poor, the magnitude of copyright&#8217;s negative impact on neglected language (cf. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neglected_diseases">neglected disease</a>) populations was new to me &#8212; the requirement of permission to translate contributes to almost no books being available in these languages, for pleasure, or for education, the latter creating a bottleneck for further life opportunities (n.b. &#8220;everyone should learn English&#8221; is a multi-generation strategy only successfully carried out by wealthy countries so far).</p>
<p>The cost issue is obvious, but can hardly be repeated enough. Shaver provides the example of books (when available at all, almost always in English) costing 2x as much in South Africa as in the US or UK, while income is far lower, especially for the poor (about half of the population lives on less than US$50 a month).</p>
<p>Many countries are far poorer than South Africa, and large populations dependent on neglected languages are common. Many wealthy countries, the U.S. in particular, have large populations of poor and neglected language speakers. Copyright is helping keep the poor poor everywhere. (Expensive textbooks are appropriately a priority target in the U.S., but every good that carries a copyright monopoly tax contributes in some combination to material poverty and cultural exclusion.)</p>
<p>Shaver makes a very strong case for including distributive justice in copyright discourse, along the way summarizing well known problems with the dominant romantic authorship + incentive narrative which has sidelined equality. She doesn&#8217;t push for any single solution, but the most interesting discussion is of the possibility of a carve out for translation to neglected languages, along the lines of such for braille and audio versions for use by blind users. Shaver says that copyright term extension should be opposed (additionally) for distributive justice concerns, but term reduction is &#8220;politically impossible&#8221; due to treaty obligation. (In what other fields is scholarly discourse on substantially alternative and obviously superior arrangements &#8212; the current regime based on &#8220;more fallacy than fact&#8221; &#8212; so readily discarded?)</p>
<h3 id="commons">Commons</h3>
<p><em>Copyright and Inequality</em> mentions free/open/commons production or distribution briefly in a few places:</p>
<ul>
<li>Another scholar mentioned commons-based peer production in the context of patents.</li>
<li>The &#8220;more radical&#8221; (than providing access at public libraries) solution of &#8220;allocating public textbook funds to the production of Open Educational Resources.&#8221; (Actually a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OER_Policy_Registry">rapidly growing practice</a>.)</li>
<li>&#8220;Open business models&#8221; meaning very broadly cultural production not dependent on restricting copying.</li>
<li>&#8220;Limited commons&#8221;, e.g., copyright might be relaxed for a neglected language, but translations of new works in that language to non-neglected languages would be fully restricted.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m happy that these are included at all, but commons advocates need to make full versions central. A carve out for translation to neglected languages would be better than none, but if it is achieved, will take many years of negotiation, and be riddled with requirements that will limit effectiveness (as Shaver notes is the case with carve outs for disability), and obviously would leave all non-linguistic copyright inequality mechanisms, and the resources of interest groups that support enclosure, fully intact. Commons-based funding mandates and peer production can happen much faster, and are anything but politically impossible, and can make a huge impact, far beyond a &#8220;patch&#8221;.</p>
<p>This potential huge impact might hold especially for neglected languages, which essentially are not being served <em>at all</em> by proprietary production. For everyone, as I&#8217;ve said many <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/02/09/freedoms-commons/">times</a>, product competition from the commons both reduces the resources available to enclosure industries to lobby for protectionism and re-imagines the range of desirable policy, in sum shifting what is politically possible.</p>
<p>Buttressed with recognition of copyright inequality, in particular its negative impact on neglected language populations, what might various commons advocates, projects, and movements do? Some off-the-cuff notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve long admired Wikimedia&#8217;s commitment to host its projects (Wikipedia and friends) for any language community capable of maintaining a project, even a very small one, and its enunciation of the importance of this commitment and of Wikimedia&#8217;s freedom (as a non-profit) to pursue such a commitment. The result so far includes <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias">Wikipedia in 287 languages</a> and <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Complete_list_of_Wikimedia_projects">much more</a>, with even more in <a href="https://incubator.wikimedia.org/wiki/Incubator:Wikis">incubation</a>, <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_chapters">formal</a> and informal movement communities around the world, a <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Zero">program</a> to make Wikipedia access free of mobile data charges in the  developing world, and probably much more I&#8217;m not aware of. Should the findings of <em>Copyright and Inequality</em> lead the various parts of the Wikimedia movement to multiply their efforts to support the growth of and access to free knowledge in neglected languages and increase estimates of the Wikimedia movement&#8217;s <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/08/wikipedias-economic-values/">economic values</a> accordingly? The paper&#8217;s findings are probably already well known by the staunchest language advocates around Wikimedia, but perhaps they should be taken even more seriously than they already are. I am ignorant of the human side of Wikimedia outreach to neglected language communities, but surely there is now a substantial body of experience which could be leveraged in making further investments and partnerships. On the technical side, perhaps the migration of lots of knowledge into the truly multilingual Wikidata project could enable more projects in more languages to be truly useful, even for very small language communities?</li>
<li>The importance of first language availability of texts, especially educational materials, implies that software user interface availability in the user&#8217;s first language is probably pretty important too. What would it take to increase popular free/open source software application language support from dozens (Firefox claims <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/">over 80</a>, LibreOffice <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/features/">over 30</a>) to hundreds, even thousands of languages, thereby including most neglected languages? More collaboration across program translation efforts? More centralization? Collaboration with governments, educational systems, funders? A higher bar for user interface changes requiring translation updates? <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/22/open-source-proliferation-problem/">Fewer</a> programs?</li>
<li>Fund the creation new free knowledge (inclusive of entertainment!) works in neglected languages, e.g., with small grants and prizes, and introduction of collaborative production, e.g., <a href="http://www.booksprints.net/">book sprints</a>?</li>
<li>Market, sell, distribute, push for adoption of free knowledge works among neglected language populations &#8212; this is what publishers <em>do</em> (given a wealthy enough population anyway), and what must be done for the commons. Making works available online, with no promotion, only solves problems for an elite, and doesn&#8217;t offer proprietary publishers any competition, where they choose to compete.</li>
<li>Could recognition of the value of neglected languages provide an impetus for a new and large effort toward <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation">free software machine translation</a>? Little progress has been made thus far, perhaps in part because some proprietary services such as Google Translate are gratis, and work for most non-neglected languages. Could redoubled effort to support neglected languages in Wikimedia projects (Wikisource <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:Translations">translations</a> might be especially relevant) and free/open source software projects help provide needed parallel corpora?</li>
<li>Awareness of the plight of neglected language populations could buttress arguments for open funding mandates, particularly if it could be demonstrated that some resulting materials were actually translated and used by said populations &#8212; neglected language translation and marketing might even be included in some such mandates, or funders and projects working with neglected language populations could specifically target translation and distribution of the &#8220;best&#8221; of the output of open funding mandates.</li>
<li>Awareness of neglected languages could buttress arguments for voluntary release of works under free/open licenses or into the public domain. (A handful of readers might note that translation-only licenses have been proposed, and a &#8220;Developing Nations&#8221; license briefly offered. The latter got almost no use before it was retired, perhaps in part because it seemed both confusing and paternalistic &#8212; and I doubt these very limited commons offer much, including in public license form. I can&#8217;t stress enough that sales/marketing/distribution/adoption are very tough and very necessary, and commons projects have largely failed at them to date. Given this, it is insane to cut off entire segments of potential collaborators, e.g., free knowledge projects and diaspora communities.)</li>
<li>Increasing commons movements&#8217; self-awareness of their ability to help neglected language populations could buttress  these movements&#8217; self-awareness of their own political potency, leading them to act unashamedly as an interest group and to boldly stake a claim for the commons as the central paradigm for information/innovation policy, thereby further increasing their political potency, and ability to help neglected language populations. (Recursion intentional!)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spectacle">Spectacle</h3>
<p>Further excerpts from <em>Copyright and Inequality</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall, copyright law works quite well for copyright scholars at leading universities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Funniest sentence in the paper, presumably unintentional. (One small bit of progress would be for &#8220;copyright scholars&#8221; to re-imagine themselves as &#8220;commons scholars&#8221;; cf. <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/12/09/scc-cc-40/#desiderata">copyright experts→commons experts</a>.)</p>
<blockquote><p>Its protections give us control over our own writings, which we can choose to invoke or to waive, as we believe best suits our own interests. Its incentives help to stimulate the production of an ever-greater variety of informative and entertaining works for our professional and personal development. Its limitations on access and use of copyrighted works only rarely pose significant problems for us. From this perspective, it is easy to miss the more profound problems posed for the 99% of the world that does not enjoy the same privileged position of access.</p>
<p>From this privileged perspective, creative production resembles a constantly expanding buffet of choice laid before us, among which we may select the most appealing options until we are full. Perhaps some of these offerings are being produced in languages we do not speak. No matter, more than enough choices remain. In our affluence of resources and opportunities, we might even choose to acquire fluency in a second language to further expand our choices. Copyright protection promises to raise the quality, the diversity, at the very least the sheer number of offerings placed upon the table. How could this be a bad thing? But can your peripheral vision stretch farther still? If so, you might see, standing back behind you, a hungry crowd. They are the poor. They are a majority of the world. They too admire the buffet. But they realize it is not laid for them. For some of us, the proliferation of new works is a bounty, opening up new worlds of consumer choice, new horizons of creativity to explore. For most of the world’s population, however, the expanding universe of new cultural works is yet another site of social privilege from which they are effectively excluded.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well and powerfully said regarding the unseen and neglected, but I submit further that our forward vision is profoundly myopic. Relative to the (perhaps two billion?) people who are both poor and only read a neglected language, wealthy people with English fluency are incredibly privileged, and have ready access to an astounding and ever-growing surfeit of culturally relevant educational and entertainment materials. Those employed by wealthy universities have yet more ready access. Just before the humorous sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>Located in major research universities, we also enjoy supremely convenient access to the best-funded libraries in the world. As a group, we do not fail to complain when we notice that copyright law impedes our own ability to access, create, and distribute cultural works. Fortunately, our legal expertise and professional experience positions us well to both recognize the legal roots of our problems, and to suggest solutions to our legislatures and courts.</p></blockquote>
<p>But however well positioned relative to neglected language populations or the general public of wealthy countries, these complaints and suggestions always face a tremendous uphill battle, at best. The enclosure industries are much better positioned than their scholars.</p>
<p>We love whatever culture we grow up in, but I doubt the one driven by the maximization of rents available from cultural products (<a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/11/11/evaporate-patents-webrtc/#Alvestrand">cf.</a>), at the expense of freedom and equality, is anywhere near the best of possible worlds, even for those with access to those products. I think an analogy to the internet is appropriate: had a small number of closed electronic services continued to dominate, and a decentralized network never developed, we would now think of the <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2006/08/07/aolternative-history/">AOL</a>, CompuServe, and Prodigy of 2014 as <em>amazing</em> &#8212; and they would be! The much better world of the internet would be beyond the imagination of most. Culturally, that AOLternative universe is the one we live in. But we can catch some glimpses of the internet universe, e.g., in Wikipedia, in PLOS, in memories of Napster.</p>
<p>Perhaps appropriately, only acting in the interests of poor and neglected language populations, against copyright inequality, will we be able to leave the AOL culture scenario and into the internet culture universe.</p>
<p>Closing quote from <em>Copyright and Inequality</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>An often-quoted statement by John Maynard Keynes posits that “The political problem of mankind is to combine three things: economic efficiency, social justice, and individual liberty.” The perspectives of economic efficiency and individual liberty have profoundly informed our discussion of copyright law. Yet the perspective of social justice has been comparatively absent. Reckoning with the ways in which social inequality impacts the market for copyrighted work begins to supply this missing perspective. In the end, the inequality insight also leads us back to economic efficiency and individual liberty. For a system of creative production and exchange that excludes most of the world from participation is also not economically efficient. Nor does it effectively promote individual liberty for all. To promote all three of these values, copyright policy and scholarship must account for the realities of social inequality.</p></blockquote>

The specific <a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/advocacy_advisors/2014-February/000381.html">context</a> is not needed for the points are apropos to nearly all contemporary info policy discourse &#8212; recall the 2003 Benkler excerpt I emphasized <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/02/09/freedoms-commons/">a few posts ago</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Although the claim that the Internet leads to some form or another of “decentralization” is not new, <b>the fundamental role played in this transformation by the emergence of non-market, nonproprietary production and distribution is often over-looked, if not willfully ignored.</b></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/advocacy_advisors/2014-February/000382.html">Villa</a>:</p>
<blockquote><ol>
<li>The framing is wrong &#8211; it should be &#8220;production models&#8221;, or &#8220;sustainability models&#8221;, not &#8220;business models&#8221; &#8211; the assumption that production of copyrighted works has to happen through &#8220;business&#8221; is a harmful and anti-democratic in an age where every citizen has access to tools that can publish to the entire world.
</li>
<li>Ditto use of &#8220;the industry&#8221;, as if &#8220;the industry&#8221; is the only meaningful producer of content. (Really, these two points alone could make for a great blog post; this paper is far from the only one that makes these two mistakes but is particularly blatant in use of the framing.)</li>
<li>In part as a result of this framing, it is sad but not surprising that no citizen/public interest groups were consulted in the creation of the material. Not sure we&#8217;d want to say that to them publicly, but if we decide not to offer informal comment I&#8217;d want to say that publicly in a blog post when this is published.
</li>
<li>If the purpose of the observatory is to study infringement, then clearly peer production should be listed as a &#8220;business model&#8221; and the infringement of peer-produced material should be treated on a par with material produced through the other production models. I&#8217;m sure this group can come up with examples of infringement of our material and of other peer-produced content.</li>
<li>Music: no mention of tools like Soundcloud (.de-based!) that are intended to democratize music creation and publication.</li>
<li>Video: no mention of how Youtube/Vimeo has created a vast amount of non-industry video content creation, or of regular traditional media industry infringement of citizen-created video without penalty or concern. (If we wanted to write this up formally for them, we&#8217;d want to find some examples of this.)</li>
<li>Sports: I can&#8217;t speak to the EU, but in the US, fan-created commentary (such as <a href="http://sbnation.com">sbnation.com</a>) is now a huge source of reporting on sports news, often delivering better quality than the traditional news sources. Probably not directly relevant to this section, though (unless there have been legal threats in the EU around fan-provided live-streaming commentary).
</li>
<li>Press content: at least in the US, donor-supported/non-profit media is an increasingly important source of news; lots of detail here: <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2013/06/10/nonprofit-journalism/">http://www.journalism.org/2013/06/10/nonprofit-journalism/</a> Don&#8217;t know if there are EU-based examples of this.
</li>
<li>Social media: with regards to 4.7 (news/social media), it should be noted that social media probably disproportionately *helps* peer-produced media, since that historically has very few resources to use for marketing/distribution, and so must rely on word-of-mouth.</li>
<li>Sec. 4 and 5 consider &#8220;news&#8221; and &#8220;books&#8221;; amazingly, neither consider new text-centric methods of production of copyrighted works, like wikis or blogs. Again shows how blind this is to the actual innovation happening in the content space.</li>
<li>Books: no mention that technical protection measures have encouraged monopolization of the distribution channels, to the detriment of traditional distribution channels and to blossoming antitrust problems in the US (and presumably soon in the EU). </li>
<li>6.2: a mention of communities! But on cue, statement that these authors may not be being remunerated, as if remuneration was the only potential goal for creators. Youtube gets mentioned here, but not in Sec. 1 (Music) or Sec. 2 (Audiovisual), which is insane.</li>
<li>Sec. 7, Business Software: doesn&#8217;t mention open source. Completely nuts.</li>
<li>Sec. 8, video games: no mention that this is a golden era for independently-produced games. Not sure that fits our narrative very well, at least not without a lot of explanation.
</li>
<li>B2B Services: this feels overly focused on remuneration/commercial licensing; I suppose that is inevitable to some extent, but it seems like it would be worth noting the increased options for free, high-quality content that business can use (e.g., Flickr photos and Commons for stock photography).
</li>
<li>&#8220;The fact that the legal offers is at least as diverse as the illegal one&#8221; &#8211; ahhahahhahahhahaha. Really, it is quite amazing that they think that providing a &#8220;portal&#8221; will increase awareness of legal content. The best way to increase awareness of legal content is to provide it legally online and advertise it as such&#8230;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Near the end of the my recent post linked above:</p>
<blockquote><p>Commons-based <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/05/01/product-shape-policy/">product competition</a> simultaneously changes the facts on the ground, the range of policies imaginable, and potentially create a commons &#8220;industrial&#8221; interest group which is recognizably important to regulators and makes commons-based peer production favoring policy central to its demands &#8212; the likely Wikimedia response to the European Commission copyright consultation is a hopeful <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/European_Commission_copyright_consultation">example</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>That response has been drafted by Villa and others involved in <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Advocacy">Wikimedia movement advocacy</a>. I highly recommend the <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/advocacy_advisors">advocacy advisors</a> mailing list, where Villa posted the points above, to anyone interested in changing <em>the</em> framing.</p>
