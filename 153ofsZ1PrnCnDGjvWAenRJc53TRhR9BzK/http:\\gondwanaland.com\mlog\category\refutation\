<p>As <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/12/23/blog-indie-radio-static/#fin">promised</a>, my first annual thematic doubt post, expressing doubts I have about themes I blogged about during <a href="http:/gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/">2013</a>.</p>
<h3 id="freequality">Intellectual Freedom</h3>
<p>If this blog were to have a main purpose other than serving as a despository for my tangents, it&#8217;d be protecting and promoting intellectual freedom, in particular through the mechanisms of free/open/knowledge commons movements, and in reframing information and innovation policy with freedom and equality outcomes as top. Some representative posts: <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/30/economics-commons-conference-knowledge/">Economics and the Commons Conference [knowledge stream] report</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/08/29/future-copyright-anthology/">Flow ∨ incentive 2013 anthology winner</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/14/z3r01p/">z3R01P</a>. I&#8217;m also fond of pointing out where these issues <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/06/nfl-ip/">surface in unusual places</a> and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/05/07/ip-ceo-pay-inequality/">surfacing them where they are latent</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fairly convinced on this theme: regimes infringing on intellectual freedom are individual and collective mind-rot, and &#8220;merely&#8221; accentuate the tendencies toward inequality and control of whatever systems they are embedded in. Mitigating, militating against, outcompeting, and abolishing such regimes are trivially for the good, low risk, and non-revolutionary. But sure, I have doubts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Though I see their accentuation of inequality and control as increasingly important, and high leverage for determining future outcomes, copyright and patent could instead be froth. The cause of intellectual freedom might be better helped by fighting for traditional free speech issues, for tolerance, against mass incarceration, against the drug war, against war, against corruption, for whatever one&#8217;s favored economic system is&#8230;</li>
<li>The voluntarily constructed commons that I emphasize (e.g., free software, open access) could be a trap: everything seems to grow fast as population (and faster, internet population) grows, but this could cloud these commons being systematically outcompeted. Rather than being <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/05/01/product-shape-policy/">undersold</a>, product competition from the commons will never outgrow their dwarfish forms, will never shift nor take the commanding heights (e.g., premium video, pharma) and hence are a burden to both policy and beating-of-the-bounds competition. Plus, copyright and the like are mind-rot: generations of commons activists minds have been rotted and co-opted by learning to work within protectionist regimes rather than fighting and ignoring them.</li>
<li>An intellectual freedom infringing regime which produced faster technical innovation than an intellectual freedom respecting regime could render the latter irrelevant, like industrial societies rendered agricultural societies irrelevant, and agricultural societies rendered hunter-gatherer societies irrelevant, whatever the effects of those transitions on freedom and other values were. I don&#8217;t believe the current regime is anywhere close to being such a thing, nor are the usual &#8220;IP maximalism&#8221; reforms taking it in that direction. But it is possible that innovation policy is all that matters. Neither freedom and equality nor the rents of incumbents matter, except as obstacles and diversions from discovering and implementing innovation policy optimized to produce the most technical innovation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m not, but can easily imagine being won over by these doubts. Each merits engagement, which could result in much stronger arguments for intellectual freedom, especially knowledge commons.</p>
<h3 id="cc">Critical Cheering</h3>
<p>Unplanned, unnoticed by me until late in the year, my most pervasive subtheme was criticism-embedded-in-praise of free/open/commons entities and actions. Representative posts, title replaced with main target: <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/12/09/scc-cc-40/">Creative Commons</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/08/10/street-patrons-missing-coordination-protocol/">crowdfunding</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/11/16/dpl/">Defensive Patent License</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/03/27/realize-document-freedom-day/">Document Freedom Day</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/04/23/drm-html5-whywhat/">DRM-in-HTML5 outrage</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/07/18/exit-skype-loyalty/">EFF</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/06/08/bright-fedsocindweb/">federated social web</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/24/5-fantasy-internet-archive-announcements/">Internet Archive</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/02/13/open-knowledge-foundation/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/11/14/post-epochal-future/">SOPA/ACTA online protests</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/26/stop-killing-them/">surveillance outrage</a>, and the <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/24/whats-really-wrong-with-the-free-and-open-internet/">Wikimedia movement</a>.</p>
<p>This is an old theme: examples from <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2004/10/04/intellectual-protectionism-amelioration-committee/">2004</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2005/08/12/free-culture-free-software/">2005</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2006/10/22/defeatist-dreaming/">2006</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2007/01/02/wikipedia-advertising/">2007</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2008/09/02/25-years-of-gnu/">2008</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2011/12/12/anti-sopa-commons/">2011</a>, and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/05/04/drm-strategy/">2012</a>. 2009 and 2010 are absent, but the reason for my light blogging here bears some relation to the theme: those are the years I was, in theory, most intensely trying to &#8220;walk my talk&#8221; at Creative Commons (and mostly failed, side-tracked by trying to get the organization to follow much more basic best practices, and by vast <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/17127">amounts</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/18867">of</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20329">silliness</a>).</p>
<p>Doubts about the cheering part are implied in the previous section. I&#8217;ll focus on the criticism here, but cheering is the larger component, and real: of entities criticized in the above links, in 2013 I donated money to at least EFF, FSF, and Internet Archive, and uncritically promoted all of them at various points. The criticism part amounts to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gains could be had from better coordination among entities and across domains, ranging from collaboration toward a short term goal (e.g., free format adoption) to diffuse mutual reinforcement that comes from shared knowledge, appreciation, and adoption of free/open/commons tools and materials across domains (e.g., open education people use open source software as inherent part of their practice of openness, and vice versa).</li>
<li>The commons are politically potent, in at least two ways: minimally, as existence proof for creativity and innovation in an intellectual freedom respecting regime (carved out); and vastly underappreciated, as destroyer of rents dependent on the intellectual freedom infringing regime, and of resources available for defending those rents and the regime. Commons are not merely to be protected from further bad policy, but are actors in creating a good policy environment, and should be promoted at every turn.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear, my criticism is not usually a call for more &#8220;radical&#8221; or &#8220;extreme&#8221; steps or messages, rather more fulsome and coordinated ones. Admittedly, sometimes it may be hard to tell the difference &#8212; and this leads to my doubts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given that coordination is hard, gaining knowledge is expensive, and optimization path dependent, the entities and movements I criticize may not have room to improve, at least not in the direction I want them to improve in. The cost of making &#8220;more fulsome and coordinated&#8221; true might be greater than mutual reinforcement and other gains.</li>
<li>See the second doubt in the previous section &#8212; competition from the commons might be futile. Rather than promoting them at every turn, they should sometimes be held up as victims of bad policy, to be protected, and sometimes hidden from policy discourse.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first doubt is surely merited, at least for many entities on many issues. For any criticism I have in this space, it makes sense to give the criticized the benefit of the doubt; they know their constraints pretty well, while I&#8217;m just making abstract speculations. Still, I think it&#8217;s worthwhile to call for more fulsome and coordinated strategy in the interstices of these movements, e.g., conversation and even this blog, in the hope of long-term learning, played out over years in existing entities and movements, and new ones. I will try henceforth to do so more often in a &#8220;big picture&#8221; way, or through example, and less often through criticism of specific choices made by specific entities &#8212; in retrospect the stream of the latter on this blog over the last year has been tedious.</p>
<h3 id="iapartheid">International Apartheid</h3>
<p>For example: <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/09/21/abolish-foreignness/">Abolish Foreignness</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/07/17/contemporary-exclusion-act/">Do we have any scrap of evidence that [the Chinese Exclusion Act] made us better off?</a>, and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/04/28/illegal-immigration-is-apartheid/">Opposing “illegal” immigration <em>is</em> xenophobic, or more bluntly, advocating for apartheid “because it’s the law”</a>. I hinted at a subtheme about the role of <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/08/13/hypercity/">cities</a>, to be filled out later.</p>
<p>The system is grossly unjust and ought be abolished, about that I have no doubt. Existing institutions and arrangements must adapt. But, two doubts about my approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Too little expression of empathy with those who assume the goodness of current policy. Fear of change, competition, &#8220;other&#8221; are all deep. Too little about how current unjust system can be unwound in a way the mitigates any reality behind these fears. Too little about how benefits attributed to current unjust system can be maintained under a freedom respecting regime. (This doubt also applies to the intellectual freedom theme.)</li>
<li>Figuring out development might be more feasible, and certainly would have more impact on human welfare, individual autonomy, than smashing the international apartheid system. Local improvements to education, business, governance, are what all ought focus on &#8212; though development economics has a dismal record, it at least has the right target. Migration is a sideshow.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the intellectual freedom theme, these doubts merit engagement, and such will strengthen the case for freedom. But even moreso than in the case of intellectual freedom infringing regimes, the unconscionable and murderous injustice of the international apartheid regime must be condemned from the rooftops. It is sickening and unproductive to allow discourse on this topic to proceed as if the regime is anything but an abomination, however unfeasible its destruction may seem in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>
<p>Although much of what I write here can be deemed political, one political theme not subsumed by others is inadequate self-regulation of the government &#8220;market&#8221;, e.g., <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/03/31/democratic-terrorist-regimes/">What to do about democratically elected terrorist regimes</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/06/09/manning-snowden-heroes/">Suppose they gave a war on terror and a few exposed it as terror</a>, and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/14/negative-sum-us-state-competition/">Why does the U.S. federal government permit negative sum competition among U.S. states and localities?</a></p>
<p>The main problem with this theme is omission rather than doubt &#8212; no solutions proposed. Had I done so, I&#8217;d have plenty to doubt.</p>
<h3 id="refutation">Refutation</h3>
<p>I fell behind, doing refuting only posts from <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/03/31/2005q1-refutation/">first</a> and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/12/14/2005q2-refutation/">second</a> quarters of 2005. My doubt about this enjoyable exercise is that it is too contrived. Many of the refutations are flippant and don&#8217;t reflect any real doubts or knowledge gained in the last 8 years. That doubt is what led me to the exercise of this post. How did I do?</p>

<p><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/03/31/2005q1-refutation/">First quarter</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/02/04/refutation/">8 year refutation start</a>. This post is about six months late.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2005/04/08/imperial-public-license/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Imperial Public License">Imperial Public License</a></b>. Protection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_industry_argument">growing industries</a> within a jurisdiction is how that jurisdiction&#8217;s economy moves up the food chain, gains competitive advantage, develops. The GPL limits one means of protecting a budding software industry within a jurisdiction, and the beneficiaries are jurisdictions with dominant software industries. Jonathan Schwartz was right: the GPL is, perhaps inadvertently, a tool of U.S. economic imperialism.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2005/04/19/individual-rights-central-railroad/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Individual Rights Central Railroad">Individual Rights Central Railroad</a></b>. A site promoting a symbol that looked like a railroad logo, promoting the faulty idea that freedom is founded on individual rights:<br />
<blockquote>The Individual-i symbol is not owned by any organization. There is no platform, no organizational structure, no meetings. This symbol is in the public domain: uncopyrighted, untrademarked, unowned. Anyone can use it for any purpose.</p></blockquote>
<p>No trampling on the free speech or other rights of any individual there! Very self-consistent. But also self-refuting, in time. The site went down after only 4 years, cared for by nobody, as with all freedom founded on individual rights.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2005/04/20/really-offshoring/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Really Offshoring">Really Offshoring</a></b>. Even if working on a boat offshore a wealthy area were feasible (that part of the post is nearly self-refuting, admitting that boats are expensive), it would have a miniscule impact on talent utilization and wage equalization. Good local education dwarfs any effort to bring existing capital and labor geographically closer.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2005/04/23/evidence-free-policy/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Evidence-free Policy">Evidence-free Policy</a></b>. Policy does not get made without evidence, let alone delusionally. What&#8217;s delusional is me not looking at evidence indicating that outcomes I desire are not those of the majority. Poking fun at seemingly awry policies that repeatedly result in, e.g., cost overruns or incumbent protection, is the romance of the libertarian social engineer: demanding premature optimization of democracy.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2005/04/25/apartheid-for-musicians/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Apartheid for Musicians">Apartheid for Musicians</a></b>. Perhaps visas should be easier to obtain for musicians &#8212; to the extent they were made difficult to obtain in order to keep USians free of foreign influence, they are outmoded. But generalizing this to a call for removing all national barriers to travel, live, and work is wildly uncalled for. USian workers, including musicians, do deserve to be protected from race-to-the-bottom competition, and difficult to obtain visas are a key mechanism of protection.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2005/04/26/manifesto-for-the-abolition-of-international-apartheid/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Manifesto for the Abolition of International Apartheid">Manifesto for the Abolition of International Apartheid</a></b>. The international system of states, borders, and movement restrictions is not Apartheid. Almost every person in the world is equal, in that they are born citizens of one state. Under Apartheid, non-whites denied citizenship in their birth state. The Apartheid regime tried to legitimize this by creating puppet states for non-whites to be citizens of. The international community of nations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantustan#International_recognition">refused to recognize</a> this scheme. There may be situations in which a population of one nation state is so oppressed by another nation state that the population of the former have effectively been stripped of their citizenship. This relation may bear some similarity to Apartheid, and one extreme solution would be to make the entire population of the oppressed state <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2007/01/06/invasion-ethics/">full citizens of the oppressor state</a>. In his 2008 campaign for U.S. president, Toyama Koichi <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGZqOkeYbB0">made a case</a> for the United States having such an oppressor relation with the whole world, and thus the obligation to grant all rights as citizens. However, the proper solution is full independence, de jure and de facto, for the oppressed people&#8217;s state (watch the linked video to the end, and see that Koichi agrees). In no case however is there a call for any citizen of any state to claim citizenship rights in or travel to, live or work in, any other state, without restriction, nor is there any similarity of this general system to Apartheid.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2005/04/27/open-h1b-gates/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Open the H1B Gates">Open the H1B Gates</a></b>. The narrow industrial policy tweak of scrapping H-1B visa limits wished for by Bill Gates in no way supports generally removing restrictions on travel and work across borders. Shrink-wrap software development not leaving the U.S. for India and elsewhere shows just how little value could be obtained through the disruptive policy of scrapping H-1B visa limits, let alone removing all citizenship-based restrictions.</p>
<p><b id="dominant"><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2005/05/13/public-goods-group-shopping/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Public Goods Group Shopping">Public Goods Group Shopping</a></b> and <b><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2005/06/02/sitaker-dominant-assurance-contracts/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Kragen Sitaker on Dominant Assurance Contracts">Kragen Sitaker on Dominant Assurance Contracts</a></b>. Assurance contracts do fine for funding simple consumer products but have never addressed any political problems, and a handwaving assertion that many political problems can be thought of as public goods problems does not make it any more feasible for this to occur. The additional capital and mechanics required by dominant assurance contracts make them a merely cute idea.</p>

					<div class='e-content'><p>Rob Kaye of MusicBrainz writes about their <a href="http://blog.musicbrainz.org/2013/09/03/our-rdfa-dilemma/">RDFa dilemma</a>. My summary of the short post and comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone paid to have RDFa added to MusicBrainz pages a few years ago.</li>
<li>The code adding RDFa is brittle, hasn&#8217;t been maintained through MusicBrainz schema changes, thus is now broken.</li>
<li>There are no known consumers the RDFa in MusicBrainz pages.</li>
<li>Unless someone volunteers to fix and maintain the RDFa, &#8220;we’re ready to remove the broken code from our pages in an effort to remove technical debt that has accumulated over the past few years.&#8221;</li>
<li>A few people want RDFa in MusicBrainz pages maintained because &#8220;Very long term I think this is a sensible way forward – the web site as its own API&#8221; and compatibility with other semantic web initiatives.</li>
<li>Some people tentatively volunteer to help.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="shutdown"></span>Kaye&#8217;s post is a model for how to remove features &#8212; inform the relevant community, ask if anyone cares and is willing to maintain the feature in question. This could be applied in a commercial context, eg asking customers if they&#8217;re willing to pay to maintain a feature or to keep a service alive. It is somewhat odd that transaction costs are high enough/coordination poor enough that such is not as commonplace as feature removal and service shutdown.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve long liked the notion of the web site as its own API, to the extent of feeling a strong dislike for many RPC APIs for web applications, and like RDFa, but mostly I think most metadata implementation is premature, and as with <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/01/12/html-data-guide/">choosing a metadata format</a>, it is best to just ignore it till there&#8217;s an unambiguous and immediate gain to be had from implementation.</p>
<p>People pitching metadata as a solution, public or private good, are frighteningly like SEO pushers, except usually not evil. The likeness is that the benefits are vague, confusing, apparently require experts to discern and implement, and almost everyone would be better off wholly ignoring the pitchers/pushers.</p>
<p>I apologize for doing a bit of pitching over the years, wasting people&#8217;s time, making whatever I was actually trying to sell more difficult, lowering my intelligence (had I woken up on the other side of the bed some day, I&#8217;d have been <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2007/11/26/drm-bullshit/">pitching another layer of snakeoil</a>) and adding technical debt to the world.</p>
<p>Mitigating all this: there&#8217;s often no clear separation of &#8220;data&#8221; and &#8220;metadata&#8221;. It&#8217;s all data of course..</p>
<p>Perhaps people who prefix with &#8220;meta&#8221; are another class deserving a <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2011/01/08/business-model-punch/">punch in the face</a>. Note that Kaye&#8217;s post does not include the string &#8220;meta&#8221;; I&#8217;m just exploiting the appearance of &#8220;technical debt&#8221; and &#8220;RDFa&#8221; in the same text here!</p>

					<div class='e-content'><p>I featured a 468&#215;60 Google AdSense block in the footer of this blog since 2004-08-30, and included Google Analytics javascript since 2006-12-29. I failed to note adding either.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m behind on my 8 year blog refutation schedule, will probably do a six middle months post rather than Q2 and Q3 separately; see <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/03/31/2005q1-refutation/">Q1</a>. In the meantime, I&#8217;ll note removing AdSense and Analytics <a href="https://gitorious.org/mlog-wordpress/mlog-wordpress-theme/commit/b1303d879821897cb2ca7b69d8bd5433f0826ff7/diffs/8cbbe452fab9a424a96cf8c2076c40e3d59c8232">now</a>.</p>
<p>I added AdSense as a small way of getting to know a hugely significant part of the net a little better through direct experience. My revenue expectations were met over the years &#8212; trivial, due to trivial traffic and relatively innocuous placement. Viewing my blog with a browser sans adblock and with flash for the first time in perhaps years just now prompted the removal and this post, which I had planned to do in the fullness of time &#8212; the innocuous placement was still ugly, and with flash enabled all of the ads are graphical and many animated. Clearly I have learned all I am capable of learning via this experiment, which I am glad I did. If I ever have something characterized as third party ads here again, it&#8217;ll be via some very different mechanism.</p>
<p>I more dimly recall adding Analytics because I never looked at log analysis generated reports, and maybe if I looked I would find something to optimize. I seldom looked at Analytics, and never discerned anything. If I really feel the urge to look again, I&#8217;ll use a log analysis program, and if I want an Analytics-like interface, <a href="http://piwik.org/log-analytics/">use Piwik</a>. I realize for some analysis, and especially some experiments, in-page javascript can be very helpful. If I ever really want to do that, <a href="http://piwik.org/docs/javascript-tracking/">Piwik can</a>.</p>
<p>Relatedly, I&#8217;ve meant to recommend <a href="http://zgp.org/~dmarti/">Don Marti&#8217;s blog</a> for a long time, when I got around to saying and doing more about net advertising, but don&#8217;t wait for me.</p>

There seems little agreement over what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inalienable_rights#Debate">inalienable rights</a> means, and even if it did refer to impossible-to-transfer, it is not clear why 1:1 transfer is of universal interest (e.g., a murderer doesn&#8217;t get to enjoy living their victim&#8217;s life directly, but may obtain many other related things) nor why some such things should be described with the politically loaded term &#8220;rights&#8221; and other such things not: both non-comparability and substitutability and related are rampant; categories such as &#8220;inalienable rights&#8221; are mere posturing.

I don&#8217;t know whether a greater percentage of libertarians voted for Kerry than Gore (and that might get into definitional questions concerning whether a supporter of the Iraq invasion could possibly be considered libertarian), but the calculations supporting the +190k margin in the spreadsheet linked to the post, even more strongly indicated that libertarian support for both Nader and the Libertarian Party nominee would plummet. Nader&#8217;s support did crater, but libertarians were probably a negligible part of that. However, Badnarik, the LP 2004 candidate, did about as poorly as Browne did in 2000. For the candidate/party the informal survey ought to have been the strongest indicator for, it completely failed; all other calculations based on that data considered refuted.</p>

Some open source software is produced, and even plays a significant role in industry &#8212; but where it has, is not novel &#8212; standards, consortia, and other inter-firm cooperation has been important since before computers existed. All ought be deeply skeptical of a methodology which demands universal application based on mere existence proof. Families, unions, and cooperatives do not support implementation of universal communism, nor do GNU/Linux, Apache, and TuxPaint support universal software freedom. There can be no doubt, excepting extreme critiques of all technology, that software has greatly improved human lives, and most of that software is proprietary. As for my claim that government is a kingmaker in technology markets, and therefore should mandate open source so as to avoid rent seeking &#8212; Epstein would surely say that the problem is too big government: fix that rather than adding yet another to its list of favored industries.</p>

Instead, compassion is called for toward the fearful trade workers, and agitation against their bosses who seek to breed and profit from fear and hate on both sides of relative exclusion. What has been the greatest extent of cooperation between groups of workers where one group has obtained relatively vastly superior conditions and compensation to the other group, which is excluded by law and custom from the market the first group trades in? Perhaps this question would be a more effective tool for reducing hatred and grappling with fear among relatively wealthy workers than would impugning their morality.</p>
<p><span id="seasteading"></span><b><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2004/10/28/mundane-floating-concrete/">Mundane floating concrete</a></b> claimed that the biggest obstacle to seasteads would not be government opposition, but economic viability. While this might seem justified so far (there have been no seastead attempts), it is disingenuous in the long term. Seasteads do not have to become the dominant locus of production or even trading (generally outcompete land-based activity) in order to be &#8220;viable&#8221; &#8212; outcompeting land in even one medium-sized niche would be very exiciting, and could lead to more. But the post also fails to justify its critique of seasteading as &#8220;mundane&#8221; &#8212; not politically revolutionary. If seasteads did meet engineering and economic challenges, they would merely be used by states to stake exclusive claims to all of the planet&#8217;s surface (it turns out I have an unpublished draft from 2005 making this claim; I misremembered it being in the <em>Mundane</em> post, but I&#8217;m happy to not refute it now).</p>
<p><b><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2004/10/31/kerry-for-temporary-dictator/">Kerry for temporary dictator</a></b> says we must drastically curtail the prerogative of the imperial presidency. If this were a worthy objective, the endorsement of Kerry was a mistake. Had he won, it only would have terminated opposition to executive power four years earlier than actually occurred. But, the premise must also be attacked: a maximum leader is efficient; rather than casting out each in a fit of rage after one term, we must try harder to elect ones that will be beneficient in the first place. Hating the maximum leader for hard choices that a maximum leader must take only deters candidates that are potentially less power mad and more beneficient. We should celebrate democracy and our collective responsibility, not monkeywrench our elected leaders.</p>

One does not even have to speculate about unvoting as if it were something novel &#8212; explicitly political boycotts of elections deemed to be utterly corrupt (the elections themselves or the system they legitimize) is a regular occurance around the world. There is no reason to rule out the strategy &#8220;here&#8221; (wherever that is for you).</p>

Voting for one (or in the ranked case, a #1) candidate promotes forming a very satisfying fantasy bond and group identity with one&#8217;s one or #1 and others with the same preference. Merely approving candidates, even if one voluntarily only approves one, kills the animal spirits that keep the economy of democracy at full engagement.</p>

Nader was the only candidate I made an accurate prediction about, and not a very precise one at that.

<p><b><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2004/11/02/major-party-vote-trading/">Major Party Vote Trading</a></b> looked to increase the number of vote trading matches by facilitating trades across contests (there is a much more elegant way of stating this, but I&#8217;m failing to think of it) and directly between major parties &#8212; e.g., to coaelesce around relatively &#8220;good&#8221; executive and legislative candidates of opposite parties, or merely to encourage divided government, as the post suggests &#8212; rather than encouraging support of minor party executive candidates. But the increase in matches would be small, for trading across opposite major parties requires trading across an ideological divide, while trading votes between major and minor party candidates of similar leaning is only intra-ideology optimization.</p>

But reactions of horror at the possibility of splitting of a state, however viscerally-based, ought be acknowledged as capturing much wisdom &#8212; and on the flipside, the notion that states ought split in order to maximize voter preference achievement is extremely facile. One could go on for a long time enumerating the pearls captured by pro-unity gut feeling, but to begin: any possibile split introduces a period of costly uncertaintly, and extended uncertainty and perhaps terror (a smaller number of voters do not achieve their leader preferences, but those that still do not are at an even greater disadvantage), and splits in one jurisdiction encourage those elsewhere, and thus create global turmoil. If the community of nations comprised a more efficient, well regulated market (see next), regular realignment according to voter preference might be more feasible.</p>

Any state which harbors, encourages, or engages in terror (internal or external to jurisdiction) or shows indications of intending to do either should be certain of a violent intervention by other states. At the same time, international courts must be made much more powerful and robust. Non-rouge states will sue each other in these courts prior to military action. Just as within relatively peaceful jurisdictions, most would-be criminal activity is suppressed via norms and relatively certain punishment rather than through what appears on the ground as a war of all-against-all, so will perpetual worldwide peace be achived.</p>

But in effect, they&#8217;re very similar: fantasies. My guess is the &#8220;tech law&#8221; enthusiasts providing some of the narrative for each would be providing spin for the other&#8217;s vapor if they had gotten up on a different side of bed on some day.</p>

					<div class='e-content'><p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mlinksva/6833840629/" style="float:right;padding:10px"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7018/6833840629_4aa5c6bb5e_n.jpg"/></a>Late in the month but not post-deadline, the title of this month&#8217;s refutations of 8 year old posts indicates a decline in quality from the lows of 8 years and 1 month ago &#8212; surely <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/06/01/deaths-in-june-2004/">death</a> is better than deathless brokenness.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2004/07/11/bill-gates-for-broken-windows/">Bill Gates for Broken Windows</a></b> assumes Gates spoke of global welfare rather than from the perspective of an entrepreneur. The latter is both more charitable and more probable given Gates&#8217; history. If one wants to run a business which holds intellectual property and employs people, open source is not the most obvious path, and that was much more true in 2004 than now. I also extrapolated from Gates&#8217; assumed global welfare statement to an assumed ridiculous scenario in which we&#8217;d be better off if all software created in the previous 10 years disappeared. Disregarding the fantastic nature of the scenario, it could be that forced obsolescence of software, such as that encouraged by proprietary product cycles and business failings, is for the long-term good &#8212; so that we are not stuck with old, crufty software only used because everyone else is using it. If Gates were making a long-term global welfare claim, he just may have been correct, at least for software &#8212; and I won&#8217;t even bother to criticize my criticism based on criticism of the broken windows fallacy criticism.</p>
<p>Perry Metzger stopped blogging 1.5 months after I wrote <b><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2004/07/26/perry-metzgers-undiminished-capacity/">Perry Metzger&#8217;s Undiminished Capacity</a></b>. This may be a refutation of a sort in itself, but more fundamentally I made the preposterous assumption that dispensing pearls of wisdom on mailing lists, Usenet, blogs (and now <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/perrymetzger">chicken</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/perry.metzger">face</a><a href="https://plus.google.com/116685507294337280246/posts">pus</a>) indicates any sort of capacity other than for masochism. While researching this refutation, I found two <a href="http://thinkingliberty.net/2011-01-11/">podcast</a> <a href="http://thinkingliberty.net/2011-07-05/">episodes</a> that Metzger appeared as a guest on. Below two very brief apropos excerpts (if you can&#8217;t play, view in Firefox ≥15, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/beta/">beta</a> as of this writing; I&#8217;ve only saved an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_%28codec%29">Opus</a> encoding).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m fairly pleased with this month&#8217;s refutation of 8-year old posts!</p>
<p><b><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2004/06/08/sloths-and-their-slothfulness/">Sloths and Their Slothfulness</a></b> is extremely non-insightful, failing to foresee providing links to source and more broadly web colophons (regarding which I&#8217;ve long held an inadequately insightful draft post), and failing to foresee &#8220;blog&#8221; software eating general &#8220;CMS&#8221; software moreso than the other way around.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2004/06/09/narconon-stored-indefinitely-in-fat/">Narconon stored indefinitely in fat</a></b> bridles at inadequate criticism of Scientology and the drug war. Easy targets, making the post fluff at best. However, it&#8217;s much worse than that. Religion is a powerful organizing force and addiction a powerful disorganizing force. Even if Scientology and the drug war are poor implementations, society needs to experiment with religion and anti-addiction technologies, forms, methods, etc, together and separately, and won&#8217;t have any hope of finding optimal ones without struggling with disease-prone variants. Government support for religious technology anti-addiction programming is brave, pioneering, innovative, and necessary!</p>
<p><b><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2004/06/23/limacatzi/">Limacatzi</a></b> is irrefutable, which is a swear word. Fluff, and the last line says &#8220;Looks like <a href="http://pmx.sourceforge.net">vapor</a> so far.&#8221; The last archive.org capture of that link (there&#8217;s now a completely different project there) says <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060618104342/http://pmx.sourceforge.net/">“It&#8217;s coming…”</a></p>
<p><b><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2004/06/24/fix-web-multimedia/">Fix Web Multimedia</a></b> with a social movement, really? Be liberal in what you accept and tend to your own garden if it maximizes your utility function and people will live with and indeed love the result. Anything else just holds back innovation. A foolish devotion to standards is the hobgoblin of tech pundits.</p>
