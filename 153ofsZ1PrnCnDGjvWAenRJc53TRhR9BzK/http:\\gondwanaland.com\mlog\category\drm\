The specific <a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/advocacy_advisors/2014-February/000381.html">context</a> is not needed for the points are apropos to nearly all contemporary info policy discourse &#8212; recall the 2003 Benkler excerpt I emphasized <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/02/09/freedoms-commons/">a few posts ago</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Although the claim that the Internet leads to some form or another of “decentralization” is not new, <b>the fundamental role played in this transformation by the emergence of non-market, nonproprietary production and distribution is often over-looked, if not willfully ignored.</b></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/advocacy_advisors/2014-February/000382.html">Villa</a>:</p>
<blockquote><ol>
<li>The framing is wrong &#8211; it should be &#8220;production models&#8221;, or &#8220;sustainability models&#8221;, not &#8220;business models&#8221; &#8211; the assumption that production of copyrighted works has to happen through &#8220;business&#8221; is a harmful and anti-democratic in an age where every citizen has access to tools that can publish to the entire world.
</li>
<li>Ditto use of &#8220;the industry&#8221;, as if &#8220;the industry&#8221; is the only meaningful producer of content. (Really, these two points alone could make for a great blog post; this paper is far from the only one that makes these two mistakes but is particularly blatant in use of the framing.)</li>
<li>In part as a result of this framing, it is sad but not surprising that no citizen/public interest groups were consulted in the creation of the material. Not sure we&#8217;d want to say that to them publicly, but if we decide not to offer informal comment I&#8217;d want to say that publicly in a blog post when this is published.
</li>
<li>If the purpose of the observatory is to study infringement, then clearly peer production should be listed as a &#8220;business model&#8221; and the infringement of peer-produced material should be treated on a par with material produced through the other production models. I&#8217;m sure this group can come up with examples of infringement of our material and of other peer-produced content.</li>
<li>Music: no mention of tools like Soundcloud (.de-based!) that are intended to democratize music creation and publication.</li>
<li>Video: no mention of how Youtube/Vimeo has created a vast amount of non-industry video content creation, or of regular traditional media industry infringement of citizen-created video without penalty or concern. (If we wanted to write this up formally for them, we&#8217;d want to find some examples of this.)</li>
<li>Sports: I can&#8217;t speak to the EU, but in the US, fan-created commentary (such as <a href="http://sbnation.com">sbnation.com</a>) is now a huge source of reporting on sports news, often delivering better quality than the traditional news sources. Probably not directly relevant to this section, though (unless there have been legal threats in the EU around fan-provided live-streaming commentary).
</li>
<li>Press content: at least in the US, donor-supported/non-profit media is an increasingly important source of news; lots of detail here: <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2013/06/10/nonprofit-journalism/">http://www.journalism.org/2013/06/10/nonprofit-journalism/</a> Don&#8217;t know if there are EU-based examples of this.
</li>
<li>Social media: with regards to 4.7 (news/social media), it should be noted that social media probably disproportionately *helps* peer-produced media, since that historically has very few resources to use for marketing/distribution, and so must rely on word-of-mouth.</li>
<li>Sec. 4 and 5 consider &#8220;news&#8221; and &#8220;books&#8221;; amazingly, neither consider new text-centric methods of production of copyrighted works, like wikis or blogs. Again shows how blind this is to the actual innovation happening in the content space.</li>
<li>Books: no mention that technical protection measures have encouraged monopolization of the distribution channels, to the detriment of traditional distribution channels and to blossoming antitrust problems in the US (and presumably soon in the EU). </li>
<li>6.2: a mention of communities! But on cue, statement that these authors may not be being remunerated, as if remuneration was the only potential goal for creators. Youtube gets mentioned here, but not in Sec. 1 (Music) or Sec. 2 (Audiovisual), which is insane.</li>
<li>Sec. 7, Business Software: doesn&#8217;t mention open source. Completely nuts.</li>
<li>Sec. 8, video games: no mention that this is a golden era for independently-produced games. Not sure that fits our narrative very well, at least not without a lot of explanation.
</li>
<li>B2B Services: this feels overly focused on remuneration/commercial licensing; I suppose that is inevitable to some extent, but it seems like it would be worth noting the increased options for free, high-quality content that business can use (e.g., Flickr photos and Commons for stock photography).
</li>
<li>&#8220;The fact that the legal offers is at least as diverse as the illegal one&#8221; &#8211; ahhahahhahahhahaha. Really, it is quite amazing that they think that providing a &#8220;portal&#8221; will increase awareness of legal content. The best way to increase awareness of legal content is to provide it legally online and advertise it as such&#8230;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Near the end of the my recent post linked above:</p>
<blockquote><p>Commons-based <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/05/01/product-shape-policy/">product competition</a> simultaneously changes the facts on the ground, the range of policies imaginable, and potentially create a commons &#8220;industrial&#8221; interest group which is recognizably important to regulators and makes commons-based peer production favoring policy central to its demands &#8212; the likely Wikimedia response to the European Commission copyright consultation is a hopeful <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/European_Commission_copyright_consultation">example</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>That response has been drafted by Villa and others involved in <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Advocacy">Wikimedia movement advocacy</a>. I highly recommend the <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/advocacy_advisors">advocacy advisors</a> mailing list, where Villa posted the points above, to anyone interested in changing <em>the</em> framing.</p>

					<div class='e-content'><p><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/11/25/upgrade-to-0/">CC0 is superior</a> to any of the Creative Commons (CC) 4.0 licenses, because CC0 represents a superior policy (public domain). But if you&#8217;re unable or unwilling to upgrade to CC0, the CC 4.0 licenses are a great improvement over the 3.0 licenses. The people who did the work, led by <a href="https://creativecommons.org/?author=61">Diane Peters</a> (who also led CC0), many <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Affiliates">CC affiliates</a> (several of whom were also crucial in making CC0 a success), and <a href="https://twitter.com/shinchpearson">Sarah Pearson</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mindspillage">Kat Walsh</a>, deserve much praise. Bravo!</p>
<p>Below read my idiosyncratic take on issues addressed and not addressed in the 4.0 licenses. If that sounds insufferable, but you want to know about details of the 4.0 licenses, skip to the excellent <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Version_4">version 4</a> and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/License_Versions">license versions</a> pages on the CC wiki. I don&#8217;t bother linking to sections of those pages pertinent to issues below, but if you want detailed background beyond my idiosyncratic take on each issue, it can be found there.</p>
<p>Any criticism I have of the 4.0 licenses concerns policy choices and is not a criticism of the work done or people involved, other than myself. I fully understand that the feasible choices were and are highly constrained by previous choices and conditions, including previous versions of the CC licenses, CC&#8217;s organizational history, users of CC licenses, and the overall states of knowledge commons and info regulation and CC&#8217;s various positions within these. I always want CC and other &#8220;open&#8221; organizations to take as pro-commons of a stance as possible, and generally judge what is possible to be further than that of the conventional wisdom of people who pay any attention to this scene. Sometimes I advocated for more substantial policy changes in the 4.0 licenses, though just as often I deemed such advocacy futile. At this point I should explain that I worked for CC until just after the 4.0 licenses process started, and have consulted a bit on 4.0 licenses issues since then as a &#8220;fellow&#8221;. Not many people were in a better position to influence the 4.0 licenses, so any criticisms I have are due to my failure to convince, or perhaps incorrect decision to not try in some cases. As I&#8217;ve always noted on this blog, I don&#8217;t represent any organization here.</p>
<h3 id="desiderata">Desiderata</h3>
<p>Pro-commons? As opposed to what? The title of the CC blog post announcing the formal beginning of work on the new licenses:</p>
<dd><em><a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/29639">Copyright Experts Discuss CC License Version 4.0 at the Global Summit</a></em></dd>
<p>My personal blog post:</p>
<dd><em><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2011/11/03/commons-experts/">Commons experts to develop version 4.0 of the CC licenses</a></em></dd>
<p>The expertise that CC and similar organizations ought to bring to the world is commons coordination. There are many copyright experts in the world, and understanding public copyright licenses, and drafting more, are no great intellectual challenges. The copyright expertise needed to do so ought be purely instrumental, serving the purpose of commons coordination. Or so I think.</p>
<p>Throughout CC&#8217;s existence, it has presented itself, and been perceived as, to varying extents, an organization which provides tools for copyright holders to exercise their copyrights, and an organization which provides tools for building a commons. (What it does beyond providing tools adds another dimension, not unrelated to &#8220;copyright choice&#8221; vs. &#8220;commons coordination&#8221;; there&#8217;s some discussion of these issues in a video included in my personal post above.)</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t explain in this post, but I think the trend through most of CC&#8217;s history has been very slow movement in the &#8220;commons coordination&#8221; direction, and the explicit <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/4.0#Goals_and_objectives">objectives of the 4.0 versioning process</a> fit that crawl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Commons coordination&#8221; does not directly imply the usual <a href="http://freedomdefined.org">free</a>/<a href="http://opendefinition.org">open</a> vs. proprietary/closed dichotomy. I think it does mostly fall out that way, in small part due to &#8220;license interoperability&#8221; practicalities, but probably mostly because I think the ideal universal copyregulation policy corresponds to the non-discriminatory commons that &#8220;free/open&#8221; terms and communities carve out on a small scale, including the pro-sharing policy that copyleft prototypes, and excluding any role for knowledge enclosure, monopoly, property, etc. But it is certainly possible, indeed usual, to advocate for a mixed regime (I enjoy the relatively new term &#8220;semicommons&#8221;, but if you wish to see it <span title="or nowhere, if you uncharitably consider every use of 'balance' demogagic">everywhere</span>, try every non-demagogic call for &#8220;balance&#8221;), in which case [semi]commons tools reserving substantial exclusivity (e.g., &#8220;commercial use&#8221;) make perfect sense for [semi]commons coordination.</p>
<p>Continuing to ignore the usual [non-]open dichotomy, I think there still are a number of broad criteria for would-be stewards of any new commons coordinating license (and make no mistake, a new version of a license is a new license; CC introduced 6 new licenses with 4.0) to consider carefully, and which inform my commentary below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Differentiation: does the new license implement some policy not currently available in existing licenses, or at least offer a great improvement in implementation (not to provide excuses for new licenses, but the legal text is just one part of implementation; also consider branding/positioning, understandability, and stewardship) of policy already available?</li>
<li>Permissions: does the new license grant all permissions needed to realize its policy objective?</li>
<li>Regulation: how does the license&#8217;s policy objective model regulation that ought be adopted at a wider scale, e.g., how does it align with usual &#8220;user rights&#8221; and &#8220;copyright reform&#8221; proposals?</li>
<li>Interoperability: is the new license maximally compatible with existing licenses, given the constraints of its policy objectives, and indeed, to the expense of its immediate policy objectives, given that incompatibility, non-interoperability, and proliferation must fragment and diminish the value of commons?</li>
<li id="crossdomain">Cross-domain impact: how does the license impact license interoperability and knowledge sharing across fields/domains/communities (e.g., software, data, hardware, &#8220;content&#8221;, research, government, education, culture&#8230;)? Does it further silo existing domains, a tragedy given the paucity of knowledge about governing commons in the world, or facilitate sharing and collaboration across domains?</li>
</ul>
<p>Several of these are merely a matter of good product design and targeting, and would also apply to an organization that really had a primary goal of offering copyright holders additional choices the organization deems are under-provided. I suspect there is plenty of room for innovation in &#8220;copyright choice&#8221; tools, but I won&#8217;t say more in this post, as such have little to do with commons, and whatever CC&#8217;s history of copyright choice rhetoric and offering a gaggle of choices, creating such tools is distant from its immediate expertise (other than just knowing lots about copyright) and light years from much of its extended community.</p>
<h3 id="why">Why bother?</h3>
<p>Apart from amusing myself and a few others, why this writeup? The CC 4.0 licenses won&#8217;t change, and hopefully there won&#8217;t be CC 4.1 or 4.5 or 5.0 licenses for many years. Longevity was an explicit goal for 4.0 (cf. 1.0: 17 months, 2.0: 12 months; 2.5: 20 months; <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/02/25/cc-v3-5y/">3.0: 81 months</a>). Still, some of the issues covered here may be interesting to people choosing to use one of the CC 4.0 licenses, and people creating other licenses. Although nobody wants more licenses, often called license proliferation, as an end in itself, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/11/24/ugl/">many more licenses</a> is the long term <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/01/10/open-hardware-licenses-history/">trend</a>, of which the entire history of CC is just a <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/12/21/cc-multi-licensed/">part</a>. Further, more licenses can be a good, to the extent they are significantly different from and better than, and as compatible as possible with, existing licenses.</p>
<p>To be totally clear: many new licenses will be created and used over the next 10 years, intended for various domains. I would hope, some for all domains. Proliferators, take heed!</p>
<h3 id="development">Development tools</h3>
<p>A <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/4.0">4.0 wiki page</a> and a bunch of pages under that were used to lay out objectives, issues and options for resolution, and link to drafts. Public discussion was on the cc-licenses list, with tangential debate pushed to cc-community. Drafts and changes from previous drafts were published as redlined word processor files. This all seems to have worked fairly well. I&#8217;d prefer drafts as plain text files in a git repository, and an issue tracker, in addition to a mailing list. But that&#8217;s a substantially different workflow, and word processor documents with track changes and inline comments do have advantages, not limited to lawyers being familiar with those tools.</p>
<p>100% wiki would also work, with different tradeoffs. In the future additional tools around source repositories, or wikis, or wikis in source repositories, will finally displace word processor documents, but the tools aren&#8217;t there yet. Or in the bad future, all licenses will be drafted in word processors in the cloud.</p>
<p>(If it seems that I&#8217;m leaving a a lot out, e.g., methodology for gathering requirements and feedback, in-person and teleconferences, etc., I merely have nothing remotely interesting to say, and used &#8220;tools&#8221; rather than &#8220;process&#8221; to narrow scope intentionally.)</p>
<h3 id="internationalization">Internationalization</h3>
<p>The 4.0 licenses were drafted to be jurisdiction neutral, and there will be official, equivalent, verbatim language translations of the licenses (the same as CC0, though I don&#8217;t think any translations have been made final yet). Legal &#8220;porting&#8221; to individual jurisdictions is not completely ruled out, but I hope there will be none. This is a wholly positive outcome, and probably the most impactful change for CC itself (already playing out over the past few years, e.g., in terms of scope and composition of CC affiliates), though it is of small direct consequence to most users.</p>
<p>Now, will other license drafters and would-be drafters follow CC&#8217;s lead and <a href="https://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2013-December/000735.html">stop</a> with the vanity jurisdiction license proliferation already?</p>
<h3 id="databases">Databases</h3>
<p>At least the EU, Mexico, Russia, and South Korea have created &#8220;database rights&#8221; (there have been attempts in other jurisdictions), copyright-like mechanisms for entities that assemble databases to persecute others who would extract or copy substantial portions of said databases. Stupid policies that should be abolished, copyright-like indeed.</p>
<p>Except for CC0 and some minor and inconsistent exceptions (certain within-EU jurisdiction &#8220;port&#8221; versions), CC licenses prior to 4.0 have not &#8220;covered&#8221; database rights. This means, modulo any implied license which may or may not be interpreted as existing, that a prior-to-4.0 (e.g., CC-BY-3.0) licensee using a database subject to database restrictions (when this occurs is a complicated question) would have permission granted by the licensor around copyright restrictions, but not around database restrictions. This is a pretty big fail, considering that the first job of a public license is to <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/02/25/permissions/">grant adequate permissions</a>. Actual responses to this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell all database publishers to use CC0. I like this, because everyone should just use CC0. But, it is an inadequate response, as many will continue to use less permissive terms, often in the form of inadequate or incompatible licenses.</li>
<li>Only waive or license database restrictions in &#8220;ports&#8221; of licenses to jurisdictions in which database restrictions exist. This is wholly inadequate, as in the CC scheme, porting involves tailoring the legal language of a license to a jurisdiction, but there&#8217;s no guarantee a licensor or licensee in such jurisdictions will be releasing or using databases under one of these ports, and in fact that&#8217;s often not the case.</li>
<li>Have all licenses waive database restrictions. This sounds attractive, but is mostly confusing &#8212; it&#8217;s very hard to discern when <em>only</em> database and not copyright restrictions apply, such that a licensee could ignore a license&#8217;s conditions &#8212; and like &#8220;tell database publishers to use CC0&#8243; would just lead many to use different licenses that do purport to conditionally license database rights.</li>
<li>Have all licenses grant permissions around database restrictions, under whatever conditions are present in the license, just like copyright.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the last is the right approach, and it&#8217;s the one taken with the CC 4.0 licenses, as well as by other licenses which <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mlinksva/towards-license-interoperability-patterns-of-sustainable-sharing-policy/14">would not exist</a> but for CC 3.0 licenses not taking this approach. I&#8217;m even more pleased with their generality, because other copyright-like restrictions are to be expected (emphasis added):<br />
<blockquote>Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright <i>including, without limitation,</i> performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, <i>without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized</i>. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.</p></blockquote>
<p>The exclusions of 2(b)(1)-(2) are a mixed bag; see moral and personality rights, and patents below.</p>
<p>CC0 also includes a definition with some generality:<br />
<blockquote>Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following: </p>
<ol type="i">
<li>the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform,<br />

<li>publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person&#8217;s<br />

<p>As does GPLv3:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Do CC0 and CC 4.0 licenses cover semiconductor mask restrictions (best not to use for this purpose anyway, see patents)? Does GPLv3 cover database restrictions? I&#8217;d hope the answer is yes in each case, and if the answer is no or ambiguous, future licenses further improve on the generality of restrictions around which permissions are granted.</p>
<p>There is one risk in licensing everything possible, and culturally it seems, specifically in licensing database rights &#8212; the impression that licensee which do so <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/11/26/creative-commons-version-4-0/">&#8216;create obligations&#8217;</a> related to those rights. I find this an odd way to think of a conditional permission as the creation of an obligation, when the user&#8217;s situation without said permission is unambiguously worse, i.e., no permission. Further, this impression is a problem for non-maximally-permissive licenses around copyright, not only database or other copyright-like rights.</p>
<p>In my opinion the best a public license can do is to grant permissions (conditionally, if not a maximally permissive license) around restrictions with as much generality as possible, and expressly state that a license is not needed (and therefore conditions to not apply) if a user can ignore underlying restrictions for some other reason. Can the approach of CC version 4.0 licenses to the latter be improved?</p>
<blockquote><p>For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.</p></blockquote>
<p>These are all trivialities for license nerds. For publishers and users of databases: <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/11/24/ugl/#freedata">Data is free. Free the data!</a></p>
<h3 id="rites">Moral and personality rights</h3>
<p>CC 4.0 licenses address them well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.</p></blockquote>
<p>To understand just how well, CC 3.0 licenses say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author&#8217;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author&#8217;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="patents">Patents and trademark</h3>
<p>Prior versions were silent, CC 4.0 licenses state:</p>
<blockquote><p>Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps some potential licensor will be reassured, but I consider this unnecessary and slightly harmful, replicating the main deficiency of CC0. The explicit exclusion makes it harder to see an implied license. This is especially troublesome when CC licenses are used in fields in which patents can serve as a barrier. Software is one, for which CC has long disrecommended use of CC licenses largely because software is already well-covered by licenses with which CC licenses are mostly incompatible with; the explicit patent exclusion in the CC 4.0 licenses makes them even less suitable. Hardware design is another such field, but one with fragmented licensing, including use of CC licenses. CC should now explicitly disrecommend using CC licenses for hardware designs and declare CC-BY-SA-4.0 one-way compatible with GPLv3+ so that projects using one of the CC-BY-SA licenses for hardware designs have a clear path to a <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/05/12/gpl-semi/">more appropriate license</a>.</p>
<p>Patents of course can be licensed separately, and as I pointed out before regarding CC0, there could be curious arrangements for projects using such licenses with patent exclusions, such as <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/11/16/dpl/#floss">only accepting contributions from Defensive Patent License users</a>. But the better route for &#8220;open hardware&#8221; projects and the like to take advantage of this complementarity is to do both, that is use a copyright and related rights license that includes a patent peace clause, <em>and</em> join the DPL club.</p>
<h3 id="drm">DRM</h3>
<p>CC 4.0 licenses:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a nice addition, which had been previously suggested for CC 3.0 licenses and rejected &#8212; the concept copied from GPLv3 drafts at the time. I would have preferred to <i>also</i> remove the limited DRM prohibition in the CC licenses.</p>
<h3 id="by">Attribution</h3>
<p>The CC 4.0 licenses slightly streamline and clarify the substance of the attribution requirement, all to the good. The most important bit, itself only a slight streamlining and clarification of similar in previous versions:</p>
<blockquote><p>You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.</p></blockquote>
<p>This pulls in the wild use from near zero to-the-letter compliance to fairly high.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not fond of the requirement to remove attribution information if requested by the licensor, especially <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-licenses/2013-February/007327.html">accurate information</a>. I don&#8217;t know whether a licensor has ever made such a request, but that makes the clause only pointless rather than harmful. Not quite though, as it does make for a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/26549">talking point</a>.</p>
<h3 id="nc">NonCommercial</h3>
<blockquote><p>not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or <s>private </s>monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the exchange.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not intended to be a substantive change, but I&#8217;ll take it. I&#8217;d have <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2011/The_definition_and_future_of_noncommercial">preferred</a> a probably more significantly narrowed definition and a re-branding so as to increase the range of and differentiation among the licenses that CC stewards. But at the beginning of the 4.0 licenses process, I expected no progress, so am not disappointed. Branding and other positioning changes could come post-launch, if anyone is so inclined.</p>
<p>I think the biggest failure of the range of licenses with an NC term (and there are many preceding CC) is not confusion and pollution of commons, very roughly the complaints of people who would like NC to have a more predictable <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Defining_Noncommercial">meaning</a> and those who think NC offers <a href="http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses/NC">inadequate permissions</a>, respectively, but lack of valuable use. Licenses with the NC term are certainly used for hundreds of millions of photos and web pages, and some (hundreds of?) thousands of songs, videos, and books, but few where either the licensor or the public gains significant value above what would have been achieved if the licensor had simply offered gratis access (i.e., put stuff on the web, which is incredibly valuable even with no permissions granted). As far as I know, NC licenses haven&#8217;t played a significant role in enabling (again, relative to gratis access) any disruptive product or policy, and their use by widely recognized artists and brands is negligible (cf. CC-BY-SA, which Wikipedia and other mass collaboration projects <i>rely on</i> to exist, and CC-BY and CC0, which are part of disruptive policy mandates).</p>
<p>CC is understandably somewhat stuck between free/open norms, which make licenses with the NC an embarrassment, and their numerically large but low value uses. A license steward or would-be steward that really believed a semicommons license regime could do much more would try to break out of this rut by doing a complete rethink of the product (or that part of the product line), probably resulting in something much more different from the current NC implementation than the mere definitional narrowing and rebranding that I started out preferring. This could be related to my commentary on innovation in &#8220;copyright choice&#8221; tools above; whether the two are really the same thing would be a subject for inquiry.</p>
<h3 id="nd">NoDerivatives</h3>
<p>If there were licenses that should not have been brought to version 4.0, at least not under the CC brand, it would have been CC-BY-NC-ND and CC-BY-ND.</p>
<p>Instead, an express permission to make derivatives so long as they are not shared was added. This change makes so-called text/content/data mining of any work under any of the CC version 4.0 licenses unambiguously permitted, and makes ND stick out a tiny bit less as an aberration from the CC license suite modeling some moderate copyright reform baseline.</p>
<p>There are some costs to this approach: surprise that a &#8220;no derivatives&#8221; license permits derivatives, slight reduction in scope and differentiation among licenses that CC stewards, giving credence to ND licenses as acceptable for scholarship, and abetting the impression that text/content/data mining requires permission at all. The last is most worrisome, but (as with similar worries around licensing databases) can be turned into a positive to the extent CC and everyone knowledgeable emphasizes that you ought not and probably don&#8217;t need a license; we&#8217;re just making sure you have the freedoms around CC licensed works that you ought to have anyway, in case the info regulation regime gets even worse &#8212; but please, mine away.</p>
<h3 id="sa">ShareAlike</h3>
<p>This is the most improved named (BY/NC/ND/SA) elements in CC 4.0 licenses, and the work is not done yet. But first, I wish it had been improved even more, by making more uses unambiguously &#8220;trigger&#8221; the SA provision. This has been done once, starting in 2.0:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (&#8220;synching&#8221;) will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.</p></blockquote>
<p>The obvious next expansion would have been use of images (still or moving) in contextual relation to other material, eg illustrations used in a text. Without this expansion, CC-BY-SA and CC-BY-NC-SA are essentially identical to CC-BY and CC-BY-NC respectively for the vast majority of actual &#8220;reuse&#8221; instances. Such an expansion would have substantially increased the range of and differentiation among licenses that CC stewards. The main problem with such an expansion (apart from specifying it exactly) would be increasing the cost of incompatibility, where texts and images use different licenses. This problem would be mitigated by increasing compatibility among copyleft licenses (below), or could be eliminated by broadening the SA licensing requirement for uses triggered by expansion, eg any terms granting at least equivalent permissions, such that a CC-BY-SA illustration could still be used in a text licensed under CC-BY or CC0. Such an expansion did not make the cut, but I think together with aforementioned broadening of licensing requirements, such a modulation (neither strictly &#8220;stronger&#8221; nor &#8220;weaker&#8221;) would make for an interesting and heretofore unimplemented approach to copyleft, in some future license.</p>
<p>Apart from a subtle improvement that brings SA closer to a full &#8220;or later versions&#8221; license, and reflects usual practice and understanding (incidentally, &#8220;no sublicensing&#8221; in non-SA licenses remains pointless, is not to be found in most non-CC permissive licenses, and should not be replicated), the big improvements in CC 4.0 licenses with the SA element are the addition of the potential for one-way compatibility to CC-BY-SA, adding the same compatibility mechanism to CC-BY-NC-SA, and discussions with stewards of potentially compatible licenses which make the realization of compatibility more likely. (I would have included a variation on the more complex but in my view elegant and politically advisable mechanism <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2011/12/06/mozilla-public-license-2-0-and-increasing-public-copyright-license-compatibility/">introduced in MPL 2.0</a>, which allows for continued use under the donor compatible license as long as possible. Nobody demanded such, so not adding the complexity was perhaps a good thing.)</p>
<p>I hope that in 2014 CC-BY-SA-4.0 will be declared bilaterally compatible with the Free Art License 1.3, or if a new FAL version is required, it is being worked on, with achieving bilateral compatibility as a hard requirement, and more importantly, that CC-BY-SA-4.0 is declared one-way compatible (as a donor) with GPLv3+. An immediate step toward those ends will be finalizing an additional <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/DRAFT_ShareAlike_Statement_of_Intent">statement of intent</a> regarding the stewardship of licenses with the ShareAlike element.</p>
<p>Though I&#8217;ll be surprised if any license appears as a candidate for compatibility with CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0, adding the mechanism to that license is a good thing: as a matter of general license stewardship, reducing the barriers to someone else creating a better NC license (see above), and keeping &#8220;porting&#8221; completely outside the 4.0 license texts (hopefully there will be no porting, but if there is any, compatibility with the international versions in licenses with the SA element would be exclusively via the compatibility mechanism used for any potentially compatible license).</p>
<h3 id="tech">Tech</h3>
<p>All license clauses have <code>id</code> attributes, allowing direct linking to a particular clause. These direct links are used for references within the licenses. These are big usability improvements.</p>
<p>I would have liked to see an expansive &#8220;tech&#8221; (including to some extent design) effort synchronized with the 4.0 licenses, from the practical (e.g., a canonical format for license texts, from which HTML, plain text, and others are generated; that may be HTML, but the current license HTML is inadequate for the task) to the impractical (except for increasing CC&#8217;s reputation, e.g., investigating whether any semantic annotation and structure, preferably building on existing research, would be useful, in theory, for the license texts, and possibly even a practical aid to translation), to testing further upgrades to the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27467">&#8216;legal user interface&#8217;</a> constituted by the license texts and &#8220;deed&#8221; summaries (e.g., combining these), to just bringing various CC tooling and documentation up to date with RDFa 1.1 Lite. But, some of these things could be done post-launch if anyone is so inclined, and my understanding is that CC has only a single technology person on staff, dedicated to creating other <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Products">products</a>, and most importantly, the ability to directly link to any license clause probably has more practical benefits than anything on my wishlist.</p>
<h3>Readability</h3>
<p>One of the best things about the CC 4.0 licenses is their increased understandability. This is corroborated by crude automated readability metrics below, but I suspect these do not adequately characterize the improvement, for they include three paragraphs of explanatory text not present in previous versions, probably don&#8217;t fully reflect the improvement of splitting hairball paragraphs into lists, and have no mechanism for accounting for how the improved usability of linking to individual clauses contributes to understandability.</p>
<p>CC-BY-NC-SA (the license with the most stuff in it, usually used as a drafting template for others) from version 1.0 through 4.0, including 4.0 drafts (lower numbers indicate better readability, except in the case of Flesch; Chars/(Flesch&gt;=1) is my gross metric for how painful it is to read a document; see <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/09/22/license-readability/">license automated readability metrics</a> for an explanation):</p>

<p>It&#8217;s good for automated readability metrics that from 3.0 to 4.0 CC-BY-SA is most improved (the relevant clause was a hairball paragraph; CC-BY-NC-SA should have improved less, as it gained the compatibility mechanism) and CC-BY-ND is least improved (it gained express permission for private adaptations).</p>

<p>I leave a list of recommendations (many already mingled in or implied by above) to a future post. But really, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/11/25/upgrade-to-0/">just use CC0</a>.</p>

					<div class='e-content'><p>Speaking of <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/24/whats-really-wrong-with-the-free-and-open-internet/">public benefit spaces on the internet</a>, tonight the Internet Archive is having its annual <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2013/10/02/invitation-oct-24th/">celebration and announcements event</a>. It&#8217;s a top contender for the long-term most important site on the internet. The argument for it might begin with it having many copies at many points in time of many sites, mostly accessible to the public (Google, the NSA and others must have vast dark archives), but would not end there.</p>
<p>I think the Internet Archive is awesome. <a href="http://brewster.kahle.org/">Brewster Kahle</a>, its founder, is too. It is clear to me that he&#8217;s the most daring and innovative founder or leader in the bay area/non-profit/open/internet field and adjacencies. And he calls himself Digital Librarian. Hear, hear!</p>
<p>But, the Internet Archive could be even more awesome. Here&#8217;s what I humbly wish they would announce tonight:</p>
<ul>
<li>A project to release all of the code that runs their websites and all other processes, under free/open source software licenses, and do their work in public repositories, issue trackers, etc. Such crucial infrastructure ought be open to public audit, and welcoming to public contribution. Obviously much of the code is ancient, crufty, and likely has security issues. No reason for embarrassment or obscurity. The code supporting the recording of this era of human communication is itself a dark archive. Danger! Fix it.</li>
<li>WikiNurture media collections. I believe media item metadata is now unversioned. It should be versioned. And the public should be able to enhance and correct metadata. Currently media in the Internet Archive is much less useful than it could be due to poor metadata (eg I expect music I download from the archive to not have good artist/album/title tags, making it a huge <a href="https://archive.org/post/429223/artist-album-title-track-in-filesxml-but-not-derived-file-metadata">pain</a> to integrate into my listenng habits, including to tell the world and make popular) and very limited relations among media items.</li>
<li>Aggressively support new free media formats, specifically <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/09/11/opus/">Opus</a> and WebM right now. This is an important issue for the free and open issue, and requires <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/07/01/speedy-firefox-video/">collective action</a>. Internet Archive is in a key position, and should be exploit is strong position.</li>
<li>On top of existing infrastructure and much richer data, above, build Netflix-level experiences around the highest quality media in the archive, and perhaps all media with high quality metadata. This could be left to third parties, but centralization is powerful.</li>
<li>Finally, and perhaps the deadly combination of most contentious and least exciting: stop paying DRM vendors and publishers. Old posts on this: <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/05/04/drm-strategy/">1</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/05/09/drm-openlibrary/">2</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/05/10/ebook-escrow/">3</a>. Internet Archive is not in the position Mozilla apparently think they are, of tolerating DRM out of fear of losing relevance. Physical libraries may think they are in such a position, but only to the extent they think of themselves as book vendors, and lack vision. Please, show leadership to the digital libraries we want in the future, not grotesque compromises, Digital Librarian!</li>
</ul>
<p>These enhancements would elevate Internet Archive to is proper status, and mean nobody could ever again justifiably say that <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/24/whats-really-wrong-with-the-free-and-open-internet/">&#8216;Aside from Wikipedia, there is no large, popular space being carved out for the public good.&#8217;</a></p>
<p><b id="addendum">Addendum:</b> The actual announcements were great, and mostly hinted at on the event announcement post. The <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> now can instantly archive any URL (&#8220;Save Page Now&#8221;). I expect to use that all the time, replacing webcitation.org. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131025062804/http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/24/5-fantasy-internet-archive-announcements/">This post pre-addendum</a>, including many spelling errors (written on the 38 Geary&#8230;). <a href="http://jsmess.textfiles.com/">Javascript MESS</a> and the <a href="https://archive.org/details/software">software archive</a> are tons of fun: &#8220;Imagine every computer that ever existed, in your browser.&#8221; No talk of DRM, but also no talk of books, unless I missed something.</p>

					<div class='e-content'><p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/520226/microsoft-thinks-drm-can-solve-the-privacy-problem/">Microsoft Thinks DRM Can Solve the Privacy Problem</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Under the model imagined by Mundie, applications and services that wanted to make use of sensitive data, such as a person’s genome sequence or current location, would have to register with authorities. A central authority would distribute encryption keys to applications, allowing them to access protected data in the ways approved by the data’s owners.</p>
<p>The use of cryptographic wrappers would ensure that an application or service couldn’t use the data in any other way. But the system would need to be underpinned by new regulations, said Mundie: “You want to say that there are substantial legal penalties for anyone that defies the rules in the metadata. I would make it a felony to subvert those mechanisms.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If I understand correctly, this idea really is calling for DRM. Only difference is the use case: instead intending to restrict individual user&#8217;s control over their computing device in order to prevent them from doing certain things with some &#8220;content&#8221; on/accessed their device, Mundie wants applications (i.e., organizations) to be prevented from doing certain things with some &#8220;data&#8221; on/accessed via their computers.</p>
<p>Sounds great. <em>Conceivably</em> could even be well intentioned. But, just as &#8220;consumer&#8221; DRM abets monopoly and does not prevent copying, this data DRM would&#8230;do exactly the same thing.</p>
<p><a href="https://identi.ca/mlinksva/note/aiXESNT8SB-54jvtvGIZfA">Meanwhile</a>, <a href="http://www.maclife.com/article/news/nypd_distributing_flyers_encouraging_ios_7_downloads_stop_iphone_thefts">law enforcement</a>, <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-da-gasc%C3%B3n-launch-nationwide-%E2%80%9Csecure-our-smartphones%E2%80%9D-initiative">politicians</a>, and <a href="http://oaklandlocal.com/2013/10/reducing-robberies-in-oakland-with-apples-new-ios-7-community-voices/">media</a> see devices locked down by a vendor, rather than controlled by users, as the solution to device theft (rendering the device relatively unsalable, and data inaccessible).</p>
<p>I <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/05/23/future-ip-stories/">want</a> but don&#8217;t recall any anti-info-freedom (not how it&#8217;d self-describe anyway) speculative/science fiction/fantasy, dystopian, utopian, or otherwise. Above gives some hint about how to go about it: imagine a world in which DRM+criminal law works great, and tell stories about how various types of bad actors are thwarted by the combination. Or, where society falls apart because it hasn&#8217;t been implemented.</p>
<p>Another pro-IP story idea: the world faces some intractable problem that requires massive intellectual input, cannot coordinate to solve. Maybe a disease. Maybe in the form of alien invasion that can only be defeated by creating an alien disease. Or everyone is enslaved because all is known, and everyone knows that no privacy means no freedom. But someone has the bright idea to re-introduce or strengthen IP mechanisms which save the day.</p>
<p>One story I&#8217;d like to think wouldn&#8217;t work in even cardboard form is that nobody produces and promotes big budget cultural artifacts due to lack of IP or its enforcement, and as a result everyone is sad. The result is highly unlikely as people love whatever cultural works they&#8217;re surrounded by. But, maybe the idea could work as a discontinuity: suddenly there are no more premium video productions. People have grown up with such being the commanding heights of culture, and without this, they are sad. They have nothing to talk to friends about, and society breaks down. If this story were a film, people could appear smart by informing their friends that maybe the director really intended to question our dependence on <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/04/23/drm-html5-whywhat/">premium video</a> such as the film in question.</p>

					<div class='e-content'><div style="float:right;padding:10px"><a href="http://prawokultury.pl/en/news/results-of-the-future-of-copyright-20-contest/"><img alt="Anthology Future of Copyright 2.0 cover" src="https://archive.org/download/future-of-copyright-2.0/future-of-copyright-2.0_thumb.jpg"/></a></div>
<p>The <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/06/01/copyrestriction-futures/">Futureof Copyright 2.0 contest</a> has a <a href="http://prawokultury.pl/en/news/results-of-the-future-of-copyright-20-contest/">winner, published with 8 other top entries</a>. Read the anthology PDF/EPUB/MOBI ebook, listen to an <a href="https://archive.org/details/future-of-copyright-2.0">audiobook version</a> created by me reading each entry (for the purposes of judging) on sight aloud, or individual entries linked below in my review.</p>
<p><b><em><a href="http://talllama.deviantart.com/art/A-Penny-for-Your-Thoughts-388574958">A Penny for Your Thoughts</a></em></b> by Talllama is the winner, unanimously selected by the jury. It&#8217;s a fun transposition of exactly today&#8217;s copyright and debates (including wild mischaracterization) into a future with mind uploading. Quotes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My mom and dad would get upset at me.&#8221;  He sent her a copy of his anxiety.<br />
&#8220;Well my dad says copyright is stupid,&#8221; Helen said, sending back an emotion that was pitying yet vaguely contemptuous.  &#8220;He says anyone who won&#8217;t pirate is a dummy.&#8221;<br />
Timothy scowled at her.  &#8220;My dad says that piracy is stealing.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;My dad and I have trillions of books and thoughts, so we know better than you,&#8221; Helen said.<br />
&#8230;<br />
&#8220;You see, Timothy,&#8221; his father continued, &#8220;If people didn&#8217;t have an incentive to think or dream, they wouldn&#8217;t.  And then no one would have any new thoughts.  Everyone would stop thinking because there wouldn&#8217;t be any money in it.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;But you said people had thoughts in 1920 even though there was no copyright.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re right.  What I mean is that there were no professional thinkers in those days.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;It would be bad if people stopped thinking,&#8221; Timothy said.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><a href="http://livinglibre1.wordpress.com/2013/07/16/lucys-irrevocable-colossal-terrible-mistake/">Lucy’s Irrevocable, Colossal, Terrible Mistake</a></em> by Chris Sakkas tells a story in which releasing stuff under a free license has amazing results. Unfortunately free licenses aren&#8217;t magic, and it isn&#8217;t clear to me what the story says about the future of copyright. Quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>An alternative bookshop in Sussex, on the other side of the world to Lucy, created a video ad with her favourite song as its backing track. The ad ended with a thanks to Lucy for releasing her music under a free, libre and open licence and a hyperlink. Hundreds more people visited her site, the passive consumers of big business! They used the donate button on her site to spray her with filthy lucre.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><a href="http://jacinto-davila.blogspot.com/2013/07/perfect-memory.html">Perfect Memory</a></em> by Jacinto Dávila describes a world of 2089 mediated by perfect memory of all non-intimate events and voting for assignment of credit; copyright plays what role in such future? Quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Socio-mathematics] was also the source of an unprecedented and fundamental agreement. All the stakeholders of the world came, after many unfortunate and even bloody events, to negotiate a new framework for producing and sharing common knowledge. And the basis they found was that to preserve freedom, but also the health of the whole planet and its species, that knowledge had to be shared, easily and readily, among all the stakeholders.</p>
<p>That led to a rebuttal of so-called intellectual property and copyright laws and their replacement with a body of global law acknowledging our common heritage, codependent future and the fundamental right of knowledge everyone has.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><a href="http://krzysiu.net/misc/copyrights_in_chopins_future">Copyrights in Chopin&#8217;s future</a></em> by Krzysztof Blachnicki (English translation by Wojciech Pędzich) has Chopin resurrected in 2015 through unspecified but expensive means, then exploited by and escaping from the current recording industry. A fun idea, but ultimately a stereotypical anti-recording-industry rant. Quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hope that more people will have their own opinions instead of listening to the hissing of those snakes, sucking money out of artists to pay off their new automobiles. Wake up, folks, a good musician will earn his daily bread even if he decides to let his music go for free, for all to share. A poor man will be able to listen to real music, while a wealthy man will make the artist’s effort worthwhile. Isn’t it all about just that? Each may benefit, except the music companies which become redundant, so they turn to lies in order to keep themselves afloat.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><a href="http://quotily.wordpress.com/2013/07/30/what-is-an-author-short-fiction/">What is an author?</a></em> by refined quotes is a story in which all legal ideas are closely regulated and bland, &#8220;old art&#8221; outlawed so people consume new, legal stuff, the good stuff and real artists are underground, and with an additional twist that ideas take animal form. Quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>You see? An artist is a little like an art producer. But he deals with the genuine ideas, as you see. He doesn’t buy them, like the law says he should. He just comes to places like this and spends his time with them. It’s a slow process. No one knows why precisely, but this crazy little ideas are in love with him, well, with all the artists.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><a href="http://hottoco.neocities.org/ambiguous-future-of-copyright.html">The Ambiguous Future of Copyright</a></em> by HOT TOCO is a snarky take on where copyright and computing are headed, presumably meaning to project ambiguous reception of Ubuntu/Canonical ten years into the future. Quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Friend2: &#8220;If I can extract info from this rant, I think Commonible, Ltd, is saying they&#8217;ve perfected trusted computing, fully protecting you from hacking and making ALL media available, fully compensating all value chains.&#8221;</p>
<p>Friend3 (quiet one): &#8220;I read about sth like this, Project Xanaxu. Real old stuff. The inventor thought the Web failed to transclude micropayments.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><em><a href="http://www.calpirateparty.org/forums.html#/20130730/500-years-of-copyright-law-2829106/">500 Years of Copyright Law</a></em> by Holovision embeds current copyright factoids in description of future eras. I can&#8217;t tell what its &#8220;Copynorm Exchange Decentralization Entente (CEDE)&#8221; regime consists of, but maybe that is also a current copyright factoid: someone reading a pamphlet describing copyright and mentioning a few acronyms (eg TRIPs) would not have much sense of the regime. Quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Attempts to put digital rights management into 3D printers were sooner or later unsuccessful against hardware hackers. There were open sourced 3D printers but many perceived them to be inferior to the commercially patented ones. When the commercial 3D printers were used to make other printers most companies left the marketplace. This left many still infringing the 3D printers with the excuse that the printers became &#8220;abandonware&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/anotherscratchpad/">Copyright Protest Song</a></em> by Tom Konecki doesn&#8217;t seem to say anything about the future, but does capture various bits of complaint about the current regime. Quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Everybody wants only money and success<br />
And none remembers the idea of open-access<br />
To acquire knowledge and gather information<br />
That is now the object of companies’ manipulation.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><a href="http://okiemlogika.salon24.pl/524622,copyright-real-vision-or-fantastic-vision">Copyright &#8211; Real Vision or fantastic vision?</a></em> by Arkadiusz Janusz (English translation by Kuba Kwiatkowski) contains a proposal of the type &#8220;metadata and tracking will get everyone paid&#8221; explained in a parent-child lecture. Quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The file doesn’t contain a price, only points. In other words, the price is quoted in points. A point has a different monetary value for every country. Here, the minimum wage is about 1000 dollars. We divide the minimum wage by one thousand and receive the amount value of 1 point. If you download a movie, the server checks in which country you are, and converts the points into the appropriate price.<br />
&#8230;<br />
That&#8217;s why in our times, pirates are at on the verge of extinction. Most frequently, they&#8217;re maniacs or followers of some strange ideologies.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>You can also read my review of last year&#8217;s <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/05/23/future-ip-stories/">future of copyright contest anthology</a>, which links to each selection. This year&#8217;s selections are notably less dystopian and take less of a position on what the future of copyright ought be.</p>
<p>I enjoyed judging this year&#8217;s contest, and hope it and any future iterations achieve much greater visibility. Current copyright debates seem to me to have an incredibly short-term focus, which can&#8217;t be for the good when changes which have supposedly produced the current debate are only speeding up. Additionally, and my one complaint about the contest other than lack of fame, is that &#8220;copyright&#8221; is a deeply suboptimal frame for thinking about its, and our, future. I will try to address this point directly soon, but some of it can be read from my <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/04/30/future-of-copyright/">contest entry of last year</a> (other forms of info regulation with different policy goals being much more pertinent than quibbling over the appropriateness of the word &#8220;copyright&#8221;).</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>You may see an embedded player for the <a href="https://archive.org/details/future-of-copyright-2.0">audiobook version</a> read by me below. Some of the durations shown may be <a href="https://archive.org/post/938424/incorrect-duration-for-some-tracks-in-player-tracklist-but-displayed-correctly-while-playing">incorrect</a>; the winner, <em>A Penny for Your Thoughts</em>, is actually slightly less than 15 minutes long. Sadly the player <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/03/09/firefox-playbackrate/#unadorned">obscures the browser context menu</a> and doesn&#8217;t provide a way to <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/07/01/speedy-firefox-video/">increase playback rate</a>, so first, a default HTML5 player loaded with only the winner:</p>

Please <b><a style="color:#FF0000" href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/no-drm-in-html5">sign the petition against DRM in the HTML5 standard</a></b>. Then come back and read this post.</div>
<p>Recently I wrote in <em><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/04/23/drm-html5-whywhat/">Why DRM in HTML5 and what to do about it</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Long term, the only way the DRM threat is going to be put to rest is for free cultural works to become culturally relevant.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve complained many a time that rearguard clicktivism against bad policy is not a winning strategy &#8212; especially when such campaigns don&#8217;t also promote free-as-in-freedom software and cultural works &#8212; because <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2011/12/12/anti-sopa-commons/">as I put it one of those times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a world in which most software and culture are free as in freedom there would be no constituency for attacking the Internet (apart from dictatorships and militarized law enforcement of supposed democracies)</p></blockquote>
<p>But I&#8217;m at fault too for not laying out a specific plan for making some free works culturally relevant, let alone carrying out such a plan.</p>
<p>OK, here&#8217;s one plan I recently mentioned <a href="https://microca.st/greg/note/XK5X17iFTXiBnhttE1qhUw">offhandedly</a>:</p>
<div style="padding:15px; border-style: solid; border-width: 5px; border-color:#0E4FFD; background-color:#0235FE; color:#00FFFF">
<div style="text-align:center"><b>&#8216;free-as-in-freedom ~netflix&#8217;</b></div>
<ul>
<li>crowdfund minimum number of subscriptions needed to begin
</li>
<li>subscriptions used to really nicely package/stream and promote free as in freedom video
</li>
<li>start with 1 feature-length video selection each month (perhaps even quarter during a beta phase)
</li>
<li>mix of contemporary (of which there isn&#8217;t much yet) and older public domain movies
</li>
<li>limited, promoted releases concentrate subscription audience: focused increase of cultural relevance, one work at a time
</li>
<li>given enough subscriptions, start funding new free videos
</li>
<li>obviously videos would be DRM-free, in free formats, all software used free software, and all ancillary material also free-as-in-freedom
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Good idea? Run with it, or if you&#8217;d like to subscribe or otherwise help create it in any way, <a href="http://mlinksva.limequery.com/index.php/946817/lang-en">fill out this 3 question survey</a>. Bad idea, but still care? Let me know via the survey. Or mail ml@gondwanaland.com or contact user mlinksva on some other usual channel.</p>

<small>&#8220;Kill Hollyweb&#8221; is in part a reference to the Y Combinator <a href="http://ycombinator.com/rfs9.html">Request For Startups 9: Kill Hollywood</a>. The plan above isn&#8217;t really a Kill Hollywood plan as it isn&#8217;t about replacing movies with some other form of entertainment.</small></p>

					<div class='e-content'><p>Kẏra writes <a href="http://freeculture.org/blog/2013/04/23/dont-let-the-myths-fool-you-the-w3cs-plan-for-drm-in-html5-is-a-betrayal-to-all-web-users/">Don’t let the myths fool you: the W3C’s plan for DRM in HTML5 is a betrayal to all Web users</a>.</p>
<p>Agreed, but what to do about it?</p>
<p>In the short term, the solution is to convince W3C that moving forward will be an embarrassing disaster, nevermind what some of its for-profit members want. This has been accomplished before, in particular <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-patentpolicy-comment/2001Sep/">2001</a> when many wanted W3C to have a RAND (allowing so-called Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory fees to be required for implementing a standard) patent policy, but they were embarrassed into finally doing the right thing, mandating RF (Royalty Free) patent licensing by participants in W3C standards.</p>
<p>One small way to help convince the W3C is to follow Kẏra&#8217;s recommendation to sign the Free Software Foundation&#8217;s <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/no-drm-in-html5">No DRM in HTML5 petition</a>.</p>
<p>Long term, the only way the DRM threat is going to be put to rest is for free cultural works to become culturally relevant, if not dominant (the only unambiguous example of such as yet is Wikipedia <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2011/10/21/almost-innovation/#explode">exploding</a> the category known as &#8220;encyclopedia&#8221;). One of Kẏra&#8217;s points is &#8220;The Web doesn’t need big media; big media needs the Web.&#8221; True, but individual web companies do fear big media and hope for an advantage over competitors by doing deals with big media, including deals selling out The Web writ large (that&#8217;s the &#8220;Why&#8221; in this post&#8217;s title).</p>
<p>To put it another way, agitation for &#8220;Hollyweb&#8221; will continue until Hollywood is no longer viewed as the peak of culture. I don&#8217;t mean just, and perhaps not even, &#8220;Hollywood movies&#8221;, but also the economic, ethical, social and other assumptions that lead us to demand delivery of more pyramids over protecting and promoting <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/07/18/faisfls/#equality">freedom and equality</a>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a petition to recommend signing in order to help increase the relevance and dominance and hence unleash the liberation potential of knowledge commons. Every <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2011/12/12/anti-sopa-commons/">bit</a> of <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/03/27/realize-document-freedom-day/">using</a>, <a href="http://libre.fm/">recommending</a>, <a href="https://openhatch.org/">building</a>, advocating for as <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/02/22/oa-floss/">policy</a>, and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/04/30/future-of-copyright/">shifting the conversation</a> toward intellectual freedom helps.</p>
<p>Waiting out DRM (and intellectual protectionism in general) is not a winning strategy. There is no deterministic path for <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/05/10/ebook-escrow/">other</a> media to follow <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2007/02/06/drms/">music</a> away from DRM, and indeed there is a threat that a faux-standard as proposed will mean that DRM becomes the expectation and demand of/by record companies, again. In general bad policy abets bad policy and monopoly abets monopoly. The reverse of each is also true. If you aren&#8217;t helping make freedom real and real popular, you hate freedom!☻</p>

				<small>Wednesday, March 27th, 2013</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<div class='e-content'><p>Open formats and open standards are excellent causes, but without free/open source software implementations and widespread adoption thereof, the causes are uphill battles, at best. So I&#8217;m appalled that the <a href="http://documentfreedom.org/">Document Freedom Day</a> (which is today, March 27) website information and suggested actions are merely conceptual.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s fix that, here&#8217;s the deal. Download, try, become an expert:</p>
<p><b><a href="http://libreoffice.org">LibreOffice</a>.</b> If in 2013 you&#8217;re still using Microsoft Office, you&#8217;re either in an organization/industry with extreme lock-in through custom business automation or similar that is built exclusively on Microsoft tools, or you&#8217;re actively contributing to the destruction of <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/01/27/little-brother-realidad/">freedom</a> and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/04/29/ip-regressive-tax/">equality</a> in the world. If you&#8217;ve never tried LibreOffice, or if you&#8217;ve tried one of its predecessors (OpenOffice) more than a year ago, try LibreOffice (again) now. It&#8217;s excellent, including at reading and writing non-free document formats, a necessity for adoption. But most of the value in software is not inherent, rather in many people using and knowing the software. Network effects rule, and you can make a huge difference! If you can&#8217;t be bothered, make up for it with a large donation to <a href="https://www.documentfoundation.org/">The Document Foundation</a>, LibreOffice&#8217;s nonprofit organization.</p>
<p>As the DFD website <a href="http://documentfreedom.org/about.en.html">explains</a>, document freedom isn&#8217;t just about word processor and spreadsheet documents, or even just about storage formats, but any format used to store or transmit data. Thus I put <b><a href="http://jitsi.org">Jitsi</a></b> as the second most important application to use in order to realize document freedom. It implements open standards such as XMPP and SIP to provide all of the functionality of Skype, which is completely proprietary in its formats and implementation, willing to work with oppressive governments, and increasingly castigated as bloatware or even malware by people who don&#8217;t care much about freedom. Jitsi recently <a href="http://autonomo.us/2013/03/08/jitsi-2-0/">released 2.0</a>. If in the unlikely event you&#8217;ve tried it before, it&#8217;s definitely worth another look.</p>
<p>Probably everyone knows about <b><a href="http://mozilla.org">Firefox</a></b>, but not everyone uses it, and it does have the best support for open formats of the top browsers. Also, Firefox has progressed very nicely the last years.</p>
<p><a href="http://documentfreedom.org"><img style="float:right;padding:10px" src="http://documentfreedom.org/artwork/promopics/poster-robots-a2-web-small.png"/></a></p>
<h3>Praise for Document Freedom Day</h3>
<p>DFD has missed an opportunity to promote the realization of document freedom, but that would be good in addition to, not in place of their existing messages. Direct use of free software that implements open standards is incredibly powerful, but not the only way to make progress, and despite my mini-rant above The free software movement attaches too much political significance to personal practice. People should demand their governments and other institutions adopt open standards and free software, even if people cannot do so as individuals, just as people should generally demand adoption of good policy even if they cannot personally live wholly as if good policy were already in place.</p>
<p>DFD does a reasonable job of raising awareness of good policy. I strongly encourage doing a bit to realize document freedom today, but sharing a link to <a href="http://documentfreedom.org">documentfreedom.org</a> on your social networks helps too. Just a little bit, but what can you expect from clicktivism?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>I expect pro-free/open clicktivism to <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2011/12/12/anti-sopa-commons/">promote the realization of freedom</a>!</p>
<p>I have similar <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2011/05/04/drm-vs-floss/">complaints</a> about <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/">Defective By Design</a> campaigns. Speaking of which, their <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/no-drm-in-html5">No DRM in HTML5</a> campaign is highly pertinent to DFD!</p>
<p>Putatively &#8220;open&#8221; advocates and organizations sending around .docx files and such, above mini-rant applies especially to you.</p>
<p>April (a French free software organization) has some nice <a href="https://www.april.org/en/open-formats">posters explaining open formats</a>.</p>

					<div class='e-content'><p>I read all of the pieces <a href="http://nowoczesnapolska.org.pl/2012/05/17/works-for-future-of-copyright-e-book-selected/">selected for a „Future of copyright” anthology</a> resulting from a <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/Future-of-Copyright">contest</a> run by the Modern Poland Foundation (apparently the winner of a small cash prize will be announced tomorrow; I highly recommend all of the pieces below and commend the judges for their selections):</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesse Betteridge „<a href="http://sittingonanatomicbomb.com/2012/04/14/the-terrifying-future-of-copyright">The Brick in Room 207</a>”</li>
<li>Reuben Binns „<a href="http://reubenbinns.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/history-of-copyright-2012-present">History of Copyright 2012-Present</a>”</li>
<li>Eddie „<a href="http://www.eddieshtb.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/in-session.html">In Session</a>”</li>
<li>Mike Linksvayer „<a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/04/30/future-of-copyright/">Future of Copyright</a>”</li>
<li>Aymeric Mansoux „<a href="http://su.kuri.mu/00000001/2012----MORPHOLOGY_OF_A_COPYRIGHT_TALE/">Morphology of a&nbsp;copyright tale</a>”</li>
<li>Alf Melin „<a href="http://alfmelin.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/remote-kill.html">Remote Kill</a>”</li>
<li>Carlos Solís „<a href="https://azkware.wordpress.com/2012/04/10/blurred-an-utopian-story">Blurred – a&nbsp;utopian story</a>”</li>
<li>Roland Spitzlinger „<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ontheideaofowningideas/future-of-copyright">Future of Copyright</a>”</li>
<li>Togi „<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120602073022/http://www.istogi.com/give.html">Give</a>”</li>
<li>Jarosław Żyła „<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120603081636/http://dynadev.pl/art/txt/hoa.html">Heritage of ACTA</a>”</li>
</ul>
<p>7 are fiction (the 3 exceptions are me, Spitzlinger, and Togi). 5 of these are dystopian (exceptions: Binns, Mansoux), 4 of which (exception: Żyła) involve some kind of fundamental loss of personal control as a result of intellectual protectionism (even more fundamental than drug war style enforcement involves, which Żyła&#8217;s does concern). 3 of these (exception: Eddie) involve extrapolations of DRM, 2 of which (exception: Melin) involve DRM implants.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see versions of the dystopian stories written as IP propaganda, e.g., recast as RIAA/MPAA pieces from the future (several of the stories have funnily named future enforcement organizations in that vein). Such could be written as satire, apology, or even IP totalist advocacy (utopian rather than dystopian).</p>
<p>Of the dystopian stories, Solís is probably most dystopian, Eddie most humorous, and Betteridge overall best executed. Żyła needs a bit of development &#8212; the trend posited is incongruous and unexplained &#8212; but maybe due to an unknown factor to be suggested by fictional future freakonomics, or perhaps I just missed it. Melin ends with some hope, but annoys me for contemporary reasons &#8212; why would the recipient of a body part artificially grown with &#8220;open&#8221; methods be constrained in the disposition of that part by a &#8220;Creative Commons license&#8221; on those methods? Another reason to <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/05/12/gpl-semi/">discourage use of CC licenses for hardware design</a>.</p>
<p>The two non-dystopian stories take the form of a &#8220;letter from the future&#8221; in which various &#8220;open&#8221; movements and &#8220;models&#8221; win (Binns; if I had to bet on a winner of the contest, I&#8217;d put my money on this one) and an allegory for the history and projected future of copyright (Mansoux; probably the piece I enjoyed reading most). </p>
<p>Of the 3 non-fiction pieces, Togi is most non-standard &#8212; a rant in the form of lemmas &#8212; and fun, though briefly goes off the rails in asserting that &#8220;those entities which represent the greatest tax gain will be preferred by government.&#8221; If that were the case, all that is prohibited would instead be taxed. Statements about &#8220;revenue&#8221; leave little wiggle room, but I suppose a charitable interpretation would include in &#8220;tax gain&#8221; all rents to those influencing power, be they bootleggers, baptists, or those directly obtaining tax revenue. Spitzlinger accepts the stories my piece rejects and suggests something like the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license be the default for new works, with the possibility of additional temporary restriction (a <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2005/10/18/imagine-usufruct/">one-year usufruct</a>, perhaps?).</p>
<p>All of the pieces evince unhappiness with the current direction of information governance. Of those that reveal anything about where they stand on the reform spectrum (admitting that one dimension makes for an impoverished description of reform possibilities; that&#8217;s one of the points I hoped to communicate in my piece) I&#8217;d place Binns, Melin, and Spitzlinger away from abolition, and me, Mansoux, and Togi toward abolition.</p>
<p>I expect the contest and anthology to be criticized for only representing reform viewpoints. Sadly, no maximalist pieces were submitted. The most moderate reform submission didn&#8217;t follow contest rules (not a new piece, no license offered). More than alternate perspective versions of IP dystopias, I&#8217;d like to see attempts to imagine future systems which <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/07/ip-like-barbed-wire.html">increase private returns to innovation</a>, perhaps looking nothing like today&#8217;s copyright, patent, etc., and increase overall social welfare &#8212; I&#8217;m dubious, but please try.</p>
<p><b id="winners">Update 20120524:</b> The two most fun and non-standard entries <a href="http://nowoczesnapolska.org.pl/2012/05/24/future-of-copyright-contest-winner-announced/">won</a> &#8212; <a href="http://su.kuri.mu/00000001/2012----MORPHOLOGY_OF_A_COPYRIGHT_TALE/">Mansoux</a>, with an honorable mention to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120602073022/http://www.istogi.com/give.html">Togi</a>. I now must also congratulate the judges on their good taste. Read those two, or the whole anthology (<a href="http://nowoczesnapolska.org.pl/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/future-of-copyright.pdf">pdf</a>).</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<div class='e-content'><p>I had no intention of writing <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/05/09/drm-openlibrary/">yet another post about DRM</a> today. But a new post on Boing Boing, <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/05/10/libraries-set-out-to-own-their.html">Libraries set out to own their ebooks</a>, has some of the same flavor as some of the posts I quoted yesterday and is a good departure (for making a few more points, and not writing any more about the topic for some time).</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s Boing Boing post (note their <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/05/04/happy-international-day-agains.html">Day Against DRM post from last week</a>) says a library in Colorado is:<br />
<blockquote>buying eBooks directly from publishers and hosting them on its own platform. That platform is based on the purchase of content at discount; owning—not leasing—a copy of the file; the application of industry-standard DRM on the library’s files; multiple purchases based on demand; and a “click to buy” feature.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think that&#8217;s exactly what Open Library is doing (maybe excepting &#8220;click to buy&#8221;; not sure what happened to &#8220;vending&#8221; mentioned when BookServer was announced). A <a href="http://evoke.cvlsites.org/resources-guides-and-more/dear-publisher-partner/">letter to publishers from the library</a> is fairly similar to the Internet Archive&#8217;s plea of a few days ago. Exceprt:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>We will attach DRM when you want it. Again, the Adobe Content Server requires us to receive the file in the ePub format. If the file is “Creative Commons” and you do not require DRM, then we can offer it as a free download to as many people as want it. DRM is the default.</li>
<li>We will promote the title. Over 80% of our adult checkouts (and we checked out over 8.2 million items last year) are driven by displays. We will present e-content data (covers and descriptions) on large touch screens, computer catalogs, and a mobile application. These displays may be “built” <em><strong>by staff</strong></em> for special promotions (Westerns, Romances, Travel, etc.), <em><strong>automatically</strong></em> on the basis of use (highlighting popular titles), and <em><strong>automatically</strong></em> through a recommendation engine based on customer use and community reviews.</li>
<li>We will promote your company. See a sample press release, attached.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I did not realize libraries were so much like retail (see &#8220;driven by displays&#8221;). Disturbing, but mostly off-topic.</p>
<p>The letter lists two concerns, both financial. Now: give libraries discounts. Future: allow them to sell used copies. DRM is not a concern now, nor for the future. As I <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/05/04/drm-strategy/">said a couple days ago</a>, I appreciate the rationale for making such a deal. Librarian (and Wikimedian, etc) Phoebe Ayers <a href="http://www.phoebeayers.info/phlog/?p=1578">explained it well almost exactly two years ago</a>: benefit patrons (now). Ok. But this seems to me to fit what ought to be a canonical definition of non-visionary action: choosing to climb a local maximum which will be hard to climb down from, with higher peaks in full view. Sure, the trails are not known, but must exist. This &#8220;vision&#8221; aspect is one reason Internet Archive&#8217;s use of DRM is more puzzling than local libraries&#8217; use.</p>
<p>Regarding &#8220;owning—not leasing—a copy of the file&#8221;, I now appreciate more a small part of the Internet Archive&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2012/05/02/we-want-buy-your-books-internet-archive-letter-to-publishers/">recent plea</a>:<br />
<blockquote>re-format for enduring access, and long term preservation</p></blockquote>
<p>Are libraries actually getting books from publishers in formats ideal for these tasks? I doubt it, but if they are, that&#8217;s a very significant plus.</p>
<p>I dimly recall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_escrow">source code escrow</a> being a hot topic in software around 25 years ago. (At which time I was reading industry rags&#8230;at my local library.) I don&#8217;t think it has been a hot topic for a long time, and I&#8217;d guess because the ability to run the software without a <a href="http://everything2.com/title/License+Manager+Hell">license manager</a>, and to inspect, fix, and share the software right now, on demand, rather than as a failsafe mechanism, is a much, much better solution. Good thing lots of people and institutions over the last decades demanded the better solution.</p>
