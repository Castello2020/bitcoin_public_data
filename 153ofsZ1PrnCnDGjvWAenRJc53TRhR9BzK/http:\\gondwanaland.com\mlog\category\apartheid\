				<div class="entry">
					<div class='e-content'><p>I don&#8217;t feel glad about Brendan Eich&#8217;s resignation as CEO of Mozilla, but it is probably for the best that it happened quickly. <a href="https://identi.ca/stav/comment/GbDw30JJSDC6IiQXXBBgvA">Even</a> the President of the United States has changed his tune on same sex marriage since 2008. <a href="http://recode.net/2014/04/03/mozilla-co-founder-brendan-eich-resigns-as-ceo-and-also-from-foundation-board/">Apparently</a> Eich really wanted to not even pretend to change his opinion and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/03/29/mozilla-equality/">make up for it</a>.</p>
<p>There is irony and danger in excluding holders of non-inclusive political opinions in the name of inclusivity. But the particulars of this instance make sense. (1) The excluded opinion isn&#8217;t just any. It&#8217;s in a class of opinions which deny equal rights to some people based on attributes they did not choose. Once society gets around to expanding the circle of moral equality to another group, advocacy against the expansion or for retraction quickly becomes an abomination suppressed on the free market; and not soon enough. I don&#8217;t see any way to avoid this. I suspect that the general case for socially (as opposed to legally: there should be no legal intolerance for even abominable opinions) tolerating diverse opinions is harmed if anti-equality opinions are treated as any other political opinion. (2) The opinion holder isn&#8217;t just anyone, but the symbol of a very public organization. Whether the chief executive should be such a central figure &#8212; certainly not when it comes to criminally powerful heads of nearly all states &#8212; is another question. I look forward to publicly holding the opinion that jurisdiction of birth serves as a legitimate reason for denial of equal rights becoming verboten for leaders, and in any educated company, at which point <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/09/21/abolish-foreignness/">international apartheid</a> must quickly crumble.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>I hope that this brief crisis somehow spurs Mozilla to get back to its roots, even if in other respects Eich would have been the <a href="http://www.benmoskowitz.com/?p=971">best leader to do that</a>. For anyone who cares about the Mozilla mission, the crisis reveals a lot more about governance and communications problems at the organization than about Eich&#8217;s views, which were already known last year. I don&#8217;t think the crisis was only due to the outrage of marriage equality advocates. People expect better from Mozilla than the corporate/political PR style which Mozilla seems to have adopted: non-specific hype and if that doesn&#8217;t go over well reassure without directly addressing concerns. That approach could hardly be more calculated to provoke outrage among people who feel a part of the Mozilla community.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>About crowd outrage, including destructive measures (promotion of browsers that are ethically far worse than Firefox), and Mozilla&#8217;s initial response of reassuring without directly addressing concerns (which horribly undersold Mozilla&#8217;s excellent practices and values, seeming to be offered as pathetic reassurance rather than the bedrock that they are): the whole thing reminds me of mass protest stemming from some legitimate issues, government refusal to directly address issues, and a rapid escalation to regime change as a non-negotiable demand, with destruction and opportunity creation for trolls quickly following.</p>
<p>Though in every recent case I can think of, the outraged crowd has good reason to be outraged, there is something &#8220;illegitimate&#8221; about obtaining change through packing the streets (or net), and certainly much dangerous about it: the collateral damage and opportunities created for the worst actors are enormous. Is there any hope for crowds or institutions to become &#8220;smarter&#8221; and more constructive? That&#8217;s in part what I was hoping for in the Mozilla case in my <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/03/29/mozilla-equality/">previous post</a>.</p>
<p>I can think of approximately three possibilities; hopefully many more exist. (1) Better predictions about outcomes, i.e., any at all beyond self-serving punditry. Prediction markets are one possible, but so far failed (in the sense of near zero use), mechanism. Some outraged crowd members might pay attention to risk, and perhaps even tip the crowd into more rational behavior. Within regimes (inclusive of those controlling non-state organizations) better predictions might strengthen the hands of those who advocate for responding in a way not seemingly calculated to tip the crowd into regime change as a non-negotiable demand. (2) New &#8220;legitimate&#8221; arrangements which somehow promote directly addressing concerns rapidly, without allowing any mass of angry people to demand regime change. I don&#8217;t have any concrete ideas, but might be related to (3) new &#8220;legitimate&#8221; arrangements designed to encourage change without crisis, thus reducing the &#8220;need&#8221; for crisis. In many ways (2) and (3) are the function of &#8220;the market&#8221; and &#8220;culture&#8221; with emphasis depending on topic. But organizations (state, firm, or other) play a tremendous role, so institutional design is highly pertinent. One version of such institutional design, or at least call for such, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Mangabeira_Unger">Roberto Unger</a>&rsquo;s concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowered_democracy">empowered democracy</a> (from Wikipedia, emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote><p>Unger&#8217;s proposal for political democracy calls for a <b>high energy system that diminishes the dependence of change upon crisis</b>. This can be done, he claims, by breaking the constant threat of stasis and institutionalization of politics and parties through five institutional innovations. First, increase collective engagement through the public financing of campaigns and giving free access to media outlets. Second, hasten the pace of politics by breaking legislative deadlock through the enabling of the party in power to push through proposals and reforms, and for opposition parties to be able to dissolve the government and call for immediate elections. Third, the option of any segment of society to opt out of the political process and to propose alternative solutions for its own governance. Fourth, give the state the power to rescue oppressed groups that are unable to liberate themselves through collective action. Fifth, direct participatory democracy in which active engagement is not purely in terms of financial support and wealth distribution, but through which people are directly involved in their local and national affairs through proposal and action.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t have any comments on Unger&#8217;s proposed innovations (apart from skeptical curiosity), but the goal increasing (implied positive) change while reducing crisis seems one worthy of exploration, by organizations of all sizes.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Brendan Eich&#8217;s <a href="https://brendaneich.com/2014/04/the-next-mission/">going away post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Networks breed first- and second-mover winners and others path-dependent powers, until the next disruption. Users or rather their data get captured.</p>
<p>Privacy is only one concern among several, including how to realize economic value for many-yet-individually-weak users, not just for data-store/service owners or third parties. Can we do better with client-side and private-cloud tiers, zero-knowledge proofs and protocols, or other ideas?<br />
&#8230;<br />
Can a browser/OS “unionize its users” to gain bargaining power vs. net super-powers?</p></blockquote>
<p>This is basically why I think Mozilla is so great and important. Lots of free/libre/open projects and organizations have good values. They largely don&#8217;t matter because network effects dominate. <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/10/23/billion-dollar-open-source-organizations/">Huge</a> organizations with good values are necessary, and all the better if they explicitly are thinking about the challenges imposed by the network effects of incumbents which embody poor values.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no analogy worthy of making, and cringe when others try. But I&#8217;m glad that marriage equality advocates and their predecessors in struggles for civil rights succeeded in gaining bargaining power vs. the social super-powers of the day.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/12/23/blog-indie-radio-static/#fin">promised</a>, my first annual thematic doubt post, expressing doubts I have about themes I blogged about during <a href="http:/gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/">2013</a>.</p>
<h3 id="freequality">Intellectual Freedom</h3>
<p>If this blog were to have a main purpose other than serving as a despository for my tangents, it&#8217;d be protecting and promoting intellectual freedom, in particular through the mechanisms of free/open/knowledge commons movements, and in reframing information and innovation policy with freedom and equality outcomes as top. Some representative posts: <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/30/economics-commons-conference-knowledge/">Economics and the Commons Conference [knowledge stream] report</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/08/29/future-copyright-anthology/">Flow ∨ incentive 2013 anthology winner</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/14/z3r01p/">z3R01P</a>. I&#8217;m also fond of pointing out where these issues <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/06/nfl-ip/">surface in unusual places</a> and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/05/07/ip-ceo-pay-inequality/">surfacing them where they are latent</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fairly convinced on this theme: regimes infringing on intellectual freedom are individual and collective mind-rot, and &#8220;merely&#8221; accentuate the tendencies toward inequality and control of whatever systems they are embedded in. Mitigating, militating against, outcompeting, and abolishing such regimes are trivially for the good, low risk, and non-revolutionary. But sure, I have doubts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Though I see their accentuation of inequality and control as increasingly important, and high leverage for determining future outcomes, copyright and patent could instead be froth. The cause of intellectual freedom might be better helped by fighting for traditional free speech issues, for tolerance, against mass incarceration, against the drug war, against war, against corruption, for whatever one&#8217;s favored economic system is&#8230;</li>
<li>The voluntarily constructed commons that I emphasize (e.g., free software, open access) could be a trap: everything seems to grow fast as population (and faster, internet population) grows, but this could cloud these commons being systematically outcompeted. Rather than being <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/05/01/product-shape-policy/">undersold</a>, product competition from the commons will never outgrow their dwarfish forms, will never shift nor take the commanding heights (e.g., premium video, pharma) and hence are a burden to both policy and beating-of-the-bounds competition. Plus, copyright and the like are mind-rot: generations of commons activists minds have been rotted and co-opted by learning to work within protectionist regimes rather than fighting and ignoring them.</li>
<li>An intellectual freedom infringing regime which produced faster technical innovation than an intellectual freedom respecting regime could render the latter irrelevant, like industrial societies rendered agricultural societies irrelevant, and agricultural societies rendered hunter-gatherer societies irrelevant, whatever the effects of those transitions on freedom and other values were. I don&#8217;t believe the current regime is anywhere close to being such a thing, nor are the usual &#8220;IP maximalism&#8221; reforms taking it in that direction. But it is possible that innovation policy is all that matters. Neither freedom and equality nor the rents of incumbents matter, except as obstacles and diversions from discovering and implementing innovation policy optimized to produce the most technical innovation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m not, but can easily imagine being won over by these doubts. Each merits engagement, which could result in much stronger arguments for intellectual freedom, especially knowledge commons.</p>
<h3 id="cc">Critical Cheering</h3>
<p>Unplanned, unnoticed by me until late in the year, my most pervasive subtheme was criticism-embedded-in-praise of free/open/commons entities and actions. Representative posts, title replaced with main target: <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/12/09/scc-cc-40/">Creative Commons</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/08/10/street-patrons-missing-coordination-protocol/">crowdfunding</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/11/16/dpl/">Defensive Patent License</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/03/27/realize-document-freedom-day/">Document Freedom Day</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/04/23/drm-html5-whywhat/">DRM-in-HTML5 outrage</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/07/18/exit-skype-loyalty/">EFF</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/06/08/bright-fedsocindweb/">federated social web</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/24/5-fantasy-internet-archive-announcements/">Internet Archive</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/02/13/open-knowledge-foundation/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/11/14/post-epochal-future/">SOPA/ACTA online protests</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/26/stop-killing-them/">surveillance outrage</a>, and the <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/24/whats-really-wrong-with-the-free-and-open-internet/">Wikimedia movement</a>.</p>
<p>This is an old theme: examples from <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2004/10/04/intellectual-protectionism-amelioration-committee/">2004</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2005/08/12/free-culture-free-software/">2005</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2006/10/22/defeatist-dreaming/">2006</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2007/01/02/wikipedia-advertising/">2007</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2008/09/02/25-years-of-gnu/">2008</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2011/12/12/anti-sopa-commons/">2011</a>, and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/05/04/drm-strategy/">2012</a>. 2009 and 2010 are absent, but the reason for my light blogging here bears some relation to the theme: those are the years I was, in theory, most intensely trying to &#8220;walk my talk&#8221; at Creative Commons (and mostly failed, side-tracked by trying to get the organization to follow much more basic best practices, and by vast <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/17127">amounts</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/18867">of</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20329">silliness</a>).</p>
<p>Doubts about the cheering part are implied in the previous section. I&#8217;ll focus on the criticism here, but cheering is the larger component, and real: of entities criticized in the above links, in 2013 I donated money to at least EFF, FSF, and Internet Archive, and uncritically promoted all of them at various points. The criticism part amounts to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gains could be had from better coordination among entities and across domains, ranging from collaboration toward a short term goal (e.g., free format adoption) to diffuse mutual reinforcement that comes from shared knowledge, appreciation, and adoption of free/open/commons tools and materials across domains (e.g., open education people use open source software as inherent part of their practice of openness, and vice versa).</li>
<li>The commons are politically potent, in at least two ways: minimally, as existence proof for creativity and innovation in an intellectual freedom respecting regime (carved out); and vastly underappreciated, as destroyer of rents dependent on the intellectual freedom infringing regime, and of resources available for defending those rents and the regime. Commons are not merely to be protected from further bad policy, but are actors in creating a good policy environment, and should be promoted at every turn.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear, my criticism is not usually a call for more &#8220;radical&#8221; or &#8220;extreme&#8221; steps or messages, rather more fulsome and coordinated ones. Admittedly, sometimes it may be hard to tell the difference &#8212; and this leads to my doubts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given that coordination is hard, gaining knowledge is expensive, and optimization path dependent, the entities and movements I criticize may not have room to improve, at least not in the direction I want them to improve in. The cost of making &#8220;more fulsome and coordinated&#8221; true might be greater than mutual reinforcement and other gains.</li>
<li>See the second doubt in the previous section &#8212; competition from the commons might be futile. Rather than promoting them at every turn, they should sometimes be held up as victims of bad policy, to be protected, and sometimes hidden from policy discourse.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first doubt is surely merited, at least for many entities on many issues. For any criticism I have in this space, it makes sense to give the criticized the benefit of the doubt; they know their constraints pretty well, while I&#8217;m just making abstract speculations. Still, I think it&#8217;s worthwhile to call for more fulsome and coordinated strategy in the interstices of these movements, e.g., conversation and even this blog, in the hope of long-term learning, played out over years in existing entities and movements, and new ones. I will try henceforth to do so more often in a &#8220;big picture&#8221; way, or through example, and less often through criticism of specific choices made by specific entities &#8212; in retrospect the stream of the latter on this blog over the last year has been tedious.</p>
<h3 id="iapartheid">International Apartheid</h3>
<p>For example: <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/09/21/abolish-foreignness/">Abolish Foreignness</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/07/17/contemporary-exclusion-act/">Do we have any scrap of evidence that [the Chinese Exclusion Act] made us better off?</a>, and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/04/28/illegal-immigration-is-apartheid/">Opposing “illegal” immigration <em>is</em> xenophobic, or more bluntly, advocating for apartheid “because it’s the law”</a>. I hinted at a subtheme about the role of <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/08/13/hypercity/">cities</a>, to be filled out later.</p>
<p>The system is grossly unjust and ought be abolished, about that I have no doubt. Existing institutions and arrangements must adapt. But, two doubts about my approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Too little expression of empathy with those who assume the goodness of current policy. Fear of change, competition, &#8220;other&#8221; are all deep. Too little about how current unjust system can be unwound in a way the mitigates any reality behind these fears. Too little about how benefits attributed to current unjust system can be maintained under a freedom respecting regime. (This doubt also applies to the intellectual freedom theme.)</li>
<li>Figuring out development might be more feasible, and certainly would have more impact on human welfare, individual autonomy, than smashing the international apartheid system. Local improvements to education, business, governance, are what all ought focus on &#8212; though development economics has a dismal record, it at least has the right target. Migration is a sideshow.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the intellectual freedom theme, these doubts merit engagement, and such will strengthen the case for freedom. But even moreso than in the case of intellectual freedom infringing regimes, the unconscionable and murderous injustice of the international apartheid regime must be condemned from the rooftops. It is sickening and unproductive to allow discourse on this topic to proceed as if the regime is anything but an abomination, however unfeasible its destruction may seem in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>
<p>Although much of what I write here can be deemed political, one political theme not subsumed by others is inadequate self-regulation of the government &#8220;market&#8221;, e.g., <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/03/31/democratic-terrorist-regimes/">What to do about democratically elected terrorist regimes</a>, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/06/09/manning-snowden-heroes/">Suppose they gave a war on terror and a few exposed it as terror</a>, and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/10/14/negative-sum-us-state-competition/">Why does the U.S. federal government permit negative sum competition among U.S. states and localities?</a></p>
<p>The main problem with this theme is omission rather than doubt &#8212; no solutions proposed. Had I done so, I&#8217;d have plenty to doubt.</p>
<h3 id="refutation">Refutation</h3>
<p>I fell behind, doing refuting only posts from <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/03/31/2005q1-refutation/">first</a> and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/12/14/2005q2-refutation/">second</a> quarters of 2005. My doubt about this enjoyable exercise is that it is too contrived. Many of the refutations are flippant and don&#8217;t reflect any real doubts or knowledge gained in the last 8 years. That doubt is what led me to the exercise of this post. How did I do?</p>

				<small>Saturday, September 21st, 2013</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<div class='e-content'><p>Searching for background info for a forthcoming post on a boring topic that <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/01/26/internal-passports/">should be forgotten</a>, I found the research of <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/people/Michael.Curtotti/">Michael Curtotti</a>, and was tickled to find he also has <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bh4NduUAAAAJ">papers</a> on human rights and freedom of movement, and runs a website called <a href="http://www.abolishforeignness.org/">abolishforeignness.org</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only read the oldest (2002) paper so far, <em><a href="http://anzsil.anu.edu.au/Conferences/2002/2002Proceedings.pdf#page=129">Barriers to International Freedom of Movement: A Lacuna in International Human Rights Law?</a></em>, and recommend it. The gap is real, and huge. A large proportion of humanity is excluded from escaping poverty and oppression. Curtotti quotes a book on my to-read list, <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6bVxH12Q7SQC">Closed Borders: The Contemporary Assault on Freedom of Movement</a></em>:<br />
<blockquote>The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries represent the closest approximation to an open world in modern times. &#8230; With immigration restrictions at a minimum, real freedom of international movement was a fact. The right of personal self-determination was reasonably secure for residents of Europe and the Americas, if not for other peoples ruled by them. Passports, which had fallen into disuse in much of the West, were required only in the Ottoman Empire, Russia, Romania, Bulgaria and Bosnia/Herzegovina.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why were borders then closed? In part Curtotti writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The growing influence on public policy of racist ideologies seeking to promote racially segregated national communities – including by excluding all regarded as incompatible with the prevailing racially defined national character.</p></blockquote>
<p>All the more ironic:</p>
<blockquote><p>We may note also further explicit and implicit reservation of state freedom in regard of freedom of movement and citizenship. The International Covenant on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination provides that the Convention does not prohibit discrimination between citizens and non-citizens. Further matters of citizenship, nationalisation or naturalisation remain at the free discretion of the state (subject to the requirement of non-discrimination between non-citizens) (art 1.2, 1.3). This is of course an extraordinary provision in such a Convention. It suggests that a state has virtually no obligations of “non-discrimination” to persons outside the legal and geographical boundaries of the state – notwithstanding the correlation between race and nationality, the fact that historically many states have racially discriminated to influence their ethnic composition and that the very idea of the nation-state is strongly linked to the idea of race and ethnicity. The explicit inclusion of such exemptions of course merely serves to underline that the drafters were well aware of the correlation between race and citizenship. Discrimination against foreigners is given international legal sanction by this Convention.</p></blockquote>
<p>Curtotti concludes noting the tension between state prerogative and the universality of human rights, and that discussion, then recognition of freedom of movement as a fundamental human right, rather than an glaring exception, can be the beginning of a very long process of rights implementation.</p>
<p>I hope to soon read and review the rest of Curtotti&#8217;s papers, and everything on <a href="http://www.abolishforeignness.org/">abolishforeignness.org</a>. As <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/07/17/contemporary-exclusion-act/">noted a few months ago</a>, I also want to read and review all of <a href="http://openborders.info/">openborders.info</a>. It appears these two group sites come from different perspectives: Open Borders, libertarian/negative rights/economics; Abolish Foreignness, progressive/positive rights/humanitarian. That&#8217;s good: all sorts of arguments are needed to <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2005/04/26/manifesto-for-the-abolition-of-international-apartheid/">abolish the monster of international apartheid</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I am mildly tickled to see that the authors of the <em><a href="http://yves-bonnardel.info/en/manifesto-for-the-abolition-of-international-apartheid">Manifesto for the Abolition of International Apartheid</a></em> use the <a href="http://yves-bonnardel.info/en/cc0">CC0 public domain dedication</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Why would we build a &#8220;hyperloop&#8221; instead of just moving everyone in America to one huge city?</p>
<p>We could fit basically the entire U.S. population into an area around 9,000 square miles (think New Hampshire) at the population density of Brooklyn (35,000 people per square mile), which is more than enough space for public parks and small (and even, for some, single-family) houses.</p>
<p>A good, comprehensive public rapid-transit system could get you from one end of the city to the other in a couple hours at most.</p>
<p>The rest of the country could be turned into national public wilderness and some large-scale industrialized agriculture. We could also eat bugs for protein and grow vegetable gardens.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how serious Read is, but why not, and why only &#8220;America&#8221;? All ought have access to the opportunity and wonder of The City &#8212; the opportunity and wonder of all humans.</p>
<p>Though a serious part of me is serious about this, I know that only <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/07/09/nyc-88-percent-of-us/">small progress</a> is possible for now, perhaps <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/10/the-future-of-cities.html">until the em era</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to Max Read for the fun comment, however intended.</p>

					<div class='e-content'><p>Michael Clemens, about 70 minutes into a <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2013/07/clemens_on_aid.html">podcast interview</a> says no. I&#8217;d have liked to hear more, but this was just a passing mention in a somewhat abstract conversation about Clemens&#8217; paper <em>Economics and Emigration: Trillion-Dollar Bills on the Sidewalk?</em> which I <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/05/02/emigration-trillions/">wrote about last year</a> (and similarly used a pull quote headline). I recommend the podcast and paper.</p>

<p>I suspect that most people, if they are aware of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act">Chinese Exclusion Act</a> (1882) at all, might consider it with some combination of shame, historical distance, and ignorance.</p>
<p>The Act&#8217;s precise method (explicitly race-based exclusion) may seem anachronistic (the distant view), its shameful rationale and effects are the same as the slightly less bald, but much more extensive contemporary international apartheid regime.</p>
<p>Neither the Act nor contemporary restrictions are only to be mourned for their shameful anti-humanitarian effects and their suppression of huge amounts of measured economic activity, but for their making of a qualitatively less interesting world. The U.S. Chinese population was essentially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_American_history#Statistics_of_the_Chinese_population_in_the_United_States_.281840.E2.80.932010.29">frozen between 1880 and 1940</a> and most Chinese neighborhoods in the western part of the country, of which there were many, disappeared. I speculate that the western US in particular would have had a much more rich history and contemporary institutions, and the US and China a much richer relationship, than we have now, had the interregnum created by the Act had not occurred.</p>

<p>I recently noticed a group blog called <a href="http://openborders.info/">Open Borders</a>. I&#8217;d like to read all their posts and write a summary review, but please beat me to it.</p>

				<small>Tuesday, July 9th, 2013</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<div class='e-content'><blockquote><p>The greatest concentration of the highest densities is in New York, which has 88 percent of the national population living at more than 25,000 per square mile (approximately 10,000 per square kilometer). Los Angeles ranked second at 3.5 percent and San Francisco ranks third at 3.2 percent (Figure 4).</p></blockquote>
<p>This explains why everyplace in the US other than New York City feels a bit like a rural outpost.</p>
<blockquote><p>No one, however, rationally believes that densities approximating anything 25,000 per square mile or above will occur, no matter how radical urban plans become.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.newgeography.com/content/003781-the-transit-density-disconnect">writer</a>, Wendell Cox, must mean in the US, as far higher densities are being built elsewhere.</p>
<p>But why shouldn&#8217;t there be at least <b>one</b> other real city in the US? Before discarding as an irrational thought, consider how it could happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Massive densification of an existing near-city. This does seem rather unlikely. As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/03/03/sanhattan-oaklyn/">noted before</a>, the population of San Francisco and Oakland would have to quadruple to be as dense as Manhattan and Brooklyn. Even with likely continued semi-dense infill development, and plausible recovery of lots of space for people via <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2011/12/07/occupy-980/">freeway demolition</a> and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/04/28/ban-human-drivers/">robot cars</a>, they would continue to be semi-urban.</li>
<li>Massively dense near-greenfield (probably in an existing metro area) development. I gather this is happening all over China, but to happen in the US costs would have to go way down or demand unexpectedly go way up. The first could well occur through robot and other construction technology improvements, the second is not likely but ought to occur through the <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/04/28/illegal-immigration-is-apartheid/">destruction of international apartheid</a>.</li>
<li>Mix of the first two: increased demand and decreased construction costs and space dedicated to cars allow at least one US city that isn&#8217;t NYC to do a huge amount of really dense infill development.</li>
</ol>
<p>If there were to be a dense new city within an existing US metro area, where is most likely?</p>
<p>Which US city is the best candidate for achieving the third, mixed scenario?</p>
<p>(I very selectively quoted from the Cox post, which mostly focuses on 10,000 per square mile density. There are lots of comments on the post <a href="http://www.urbanophile.com/2013/06/26/where-the-density-is/">at Urbanophile</a>, including those stating the obvious that 10k is not very dense at all.)</p>

					<div class='e-content'><p>Italy&#8217;s new government includes two naturalized citizens,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9cile_Kyenge">Cécile Kyenge</a>, minister of integration, born in Congo, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josefa_Idem">Josefa Idem</a>, minister of equal opportunity and sport, born in Germany.</p>
<p>Some excerpts from <em><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/28/italy-first-black-minister-attacked">Italy&#8217;s first black minister attacked by Northern League</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Matteo Salvini, secretary of the League in Lombardy, called the 48-year-old Kyenge &#8220;the symbol of a hypocritical, do-gooding left that would like to abolish the crime of illegal immigration and only thinks about immigrants&#8217; rights and not their duties&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sadly I doubt much of the left would really like to abolish the &#8220;crime of illegal immigration&#8221;, but it should, indeed all should be <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2005/04/26/manifesto-for-the-abolition-of-international-apartheid/">totally opposed to apartheid</a>, which is precisely what restrictions on movement, working, and residence are.</p>
<p>Immigrants&#8217; rights and duties should be no different than non-immigrants. Putting people in different moral categories due to their birth is an outrage.</p>
<blockquote><p>The AC Milan and Italy striker, Mario Balotelli, called her appointment &#8220;a further, big step towards a more civilised and responsible Italian society&#8221;. Kyenge said her top priorities included changing Italy&#8217;s citizenship laws, which are based on descent rather than place of birth.</p></blockquote>
<p>An indictment of Italy and the world that this is correctly characterized as a big step, but it is a positive step in any case.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Northern League denies it is xenophobic, insisting it is only opposed to illegal immigration. Kyenge came to Italy to study at university and married an Italian.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, laws making immigration illegal are xenophobic as is supporting such laws and using such laws to persecute some people. More bluntly, opposing &#8220;illegal immigration&#8221; is advocating for apartheid &#8220;because it&#8217;s the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shame on all who oppose the immediate destruction of the international apartheid regime, keeping billions in poverty and oppression (or put another way, <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/05/02/emigration-trillions/">massively squandering human capital</a>) out of <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2005/06/11/typing-international-apartheid/">fear</a> <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2008/02/10/citizen-race/">and</a> <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2007/01/22/immigration-racism/">racism</a>.</p>

His basic view seemed to be that foreign businesses, governments, and people were bad and sought to undermine everything USian. Hence he was opposed to trade and immigration, and sought a variety of nationalist and nativist policies to fight this conspiracy. I hated everything he wrote. &#8220;Protectionist&#8221; was a charitable description of him.</p>
<p>He ran for VP with Ross Perot in 1996. I ceased to notice him from about that time, probably largely because I started to cut back on following the spectacle of current events around then.</p>
<p>Today I learned <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/innovation/articles/20130409/09212322633/documentary-history-apple-microsoft-show-it-was-all-about-copying-not-patents.shtml">via two posts at Techdirt</a> that Choate had by 2005 (date of a book he wrote titled <em>Hot Property</em>, with hilarious burning compact disc book cover art) added intellectual protectionism to his repertoire:</p>
<blockquote><p>We recently posted about an absolutely ridiculous NY Times op-ed piece in which Pat Choate argued both that patent laws have been getting weaker, and that if we had today&#8217;s patent laws in the 1970s that Apple and Microsoft wouldn&#8217;t have survived since bigger companies would just copy what they were doing and put them out of business. We noted that this was completely laughable to anyone who knew the actual history. A day or so ago, someone (and forgive me, because I can no longer find the tweet) pointed me on Twitter to a 45 minute excerpt from a documentary about the early days of Microsoft and Apple and it&#8217;s worth watching just to show how laughably wrong Choate obviously is.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry to report that I get some dim satisfaction from learning that Choate&#8217;s trajectory led him to intellectual protectionism and feel some additional validation for using that term to describe copyright, patent, trademark, and nearby.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>I also noticed today, in searching for &#8220;intellectual protectionism&#8221;, that Rick Falkvinge is <a href="https://plus.google.com/110980345342028402481/posts/CJieqYs4X8B">thinking about using the term</a>. I endorse that, though <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/01/24/counterfeiction/">more recently</a> my preferred expansion of &#8220;IP&#8221; is Inequality Promotion &#8212; &#8220;intellectual&#8221; and &#8220;protect&#8221; each sound nice, and there&#8217;s precious little about equality in &#8220;IP&#8221; discourse. But there is a bit about inequality in the first use I can find of &#8220;intellectual protectionism&#8221; more or less in contrast to &#8220;intellectual property&#8221;, a 1999 OECD publication <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=vFle9ydzg48C&#038;lpg=PA107&#038;dq=%22intellectual%20protectionism%22%20%22intellectual%20property%22&#038;pg=PA107#v=onepage&#038;q=%22intellectual%20protectionism%22%20%22intellectual%20property%22&#038;f=false">The Future of the Global Economy: Towards a Long Boom?</a></em> in a description of a &#8220;high friction world&#8221; scenario:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a winner-take-all economy where a small knowledge elite captures most of the economic value. The economic structure rewards a few and leaves the great majority behind. The resulting social friction of a two-tier society consisting of &#8220;knows&#8221; and &#8220;know-nots&#8221; consumes much of the economy&#8217;s potential in a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>The fruits of innovation drive economic growth in some parts of the world, creating local islands of prosperity. Highly educated knowledge workers do very well, but a modest education produces little economic benefit. Low wages characterise most service and manufacturing work. Overall, organisations evolve very slowly and remain mainly traditional in form. The &#8220;fast&#8221; gradually pull away from the &#8220;slow&#8221;. Highly divergent outcomes result as a few countries do well behind high-security shields and others fall behind. <span style="background-color:yellow">Intellectual protectionism</span> is rife and the free flow of ideas is highly constrained by those who want to protect the value of their <span style="background-color:yellow">intellectual property</span> and those who want to prevent the informational &#8220;pollution&#8221; of their populations.</p></blockquote>

					<div class='e-content'><p>Are there any jurisdictions that permit or encourage people who are neither residents nor citizens to vote? Assuming each voter on average contributes something to good governance, why not as many as possible?</p>
<p>Some objections and counters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sovereignty. Citzenship and statehood are sacred bonds, like marriage between a male and a female. But the world is highly interconnected, and as people&#8217;s exclusionary notions about micro human relationships are crumbling, so will their notions about macro relationships. Excluding by default nearly all humans from participating in governance that will effect them is anti-democratic.</li>
<li>Meddling. Big city A and little town B are antipodal. Big city A voters swamp town B&#8217;s elections, extract all wealth from town B. But voting is primarily <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2005/11/25/democracy-decision/">expressive</a>, not self-interested.</li>
<li>Money. All such campaigns would be very expensive, or at least could be won with an expensive worldwide media campaign. Paradoxically, money would be much less important, as the average voter would pull information, rather than have it pushed to them: most of 7 billion people won&#8217;t be reachable by a campaign.</li>
<li>Anti-liberal. Most humans disfavor many freedoms for religious and cultural reasons. Liberal jurisdictions have checks and balances that limit state power.</li>
<li>Fraud. Prevention of all of fraud, coercion and disenfranchisement is hard; impossible to enforce extra-jurisdictionally. Hardly an excuse for choosing disenfranchisement; there would be different tradeoffs with extra-jurisdictional, even global, voting, but things like pre-registration, crypto-voting, and cross-jurisdictional cooperation could help on some dimensions; also note objections to sovereignty, meddling, and money above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, some general mechanisms to address challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>In-jurisdiction selection of candidates, extra-jurisdictional voting.</li>
<li>Override extra-jurisdictional vote by in-jurisdiction supermajority.</li>
<li>Random selection of extra-jurisdictional voters.</li>
</ul>
<p>I grant that each of the objections above present substantial problems, are not exhaustive, and my counters are overly dismissive (but I claim have interesting substance). Still, why not some experiments? How about in non-state organizational governance? [Added: Some membership organizations are such experiments.]</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re itching to tell me that local voting on desired outcomes, global betting on how to achieve same (i.e., <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2006/04/24/futarchism/">futarchy</a>) is another approach to obtaining more inputs into good governance, good for you. But all of the aforementioned is relevant to choosing desired outcomes &#8212; in some cases more should be permitted and encouraged to help choose.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/views_on_countriesregions_bt/728.php">survey</a> suggests that worldwide, Obama would trounce Romney. That&#8217;s wholly unsurprising. I&#8217;d be curious to see similar polling for many more elections in many jurisdictions.</p>
