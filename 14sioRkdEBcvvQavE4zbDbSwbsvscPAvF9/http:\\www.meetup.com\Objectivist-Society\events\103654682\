Christianity: Good or Bad for Mankind? Dinesh D’Souza vs. Andrew Bernstein
The Issue in Question Is Christianity the source of important truths, moral law, and man’s rights and thus profoundly good for mankind—or is it antithetical to all such values and thus profoundly bad? Christian conservative Dinesh D’Souza will argue that Christianity is good; Objectivist atheist Andrew Bernstein will argue the alternative.
Dan A's house in Grapevine at 7:00 PM to listen live stream. Beverages, coffee, during the debate.

Our society is interested in Ayn Rand’s philosophy of Objectivism—the philosophy of reason.
We are an active Objectivist Society, including social gatherings, discussions, and Objectivist speakers.
As detailed on our About page, our society welcomes the membership of anyone who admires Ayn Rand’s works (e.g., Atlas Shrugged) and is constructively interested in Objectivism. Non-Objectivists are welcome. A member is welcome to bring friends, family, and children as guests to appropriate events.
Please read our About page for more information, including about our interest, our purposes, what we may offer, why we do it, who we welcome, and our participation terms.
If you would like to participate, please take a few minutes to fill out your member profile, including uploading a friendly photo.
We look forward to meeting you!
