- emulator crashed while playing tekken3- when starting Gran Turismo 2 screens not showing then fails to start game- crashed while loading Driver doh just re-read OP, above all clocked at 800mhz, i should lower clock? What's your overclock and OPP? Mine crashed at 1 Ghz on OPP4, but was fine at 0.95 Ghz on OPP3, or 1.05 Ghz on OPP5

I am brought back to WizardStan's puzzle-pieces-in-a-box analogy... you guys must have used a lot of care in putting them in carefully, and proved they all fit! And the Pandora production is greenlit and poised to start. What a holiday! Thanks to all of you, Exo, notaz, ED, et al! /posted from my most favorite Christmas toy

Awesome. Thank you so much, Exophase and notaz, you are amazing.
One game that will still not run for me is 3D-Lemmings (NTSC). Music plays (and keeps playing) but the screen remains black after the "now loading" screen (the intro videos and splash screens before that display fine). I tried using interpreted mode as well as enabling/disabling all available options in all available gpu-plugins to no avail.

*squeeel*!!!!!!! Wow... I'm sure I was only using r10 when I sent my Pandora away... This is going to be sooooo AWESOME!!!!!!
It's my fave emu, but the touch of slowdown i experienced every time a battle started in FF9 was a bit annoying.
Sounds like it's gonna be smooooth as butter now! Can't wait!
And slightly pimped graphics. Who can argue with that? Merry Xmas!!!
... The Garden... it's real!! ...	... so be carefull what you feed... o.oWe all want this project to mature, so we have to mature ourselves.

Amazing speed, been playing games with 650 MHz, and yes, they were smooth and fast Awesome release Only issue I've encountered so far:
The characters in Xenogears now have parts missing. It's playable, just looks a bit weird Got some spare bitcoins and you want to support me?Send them here: 1JFMx842TLW8sLKS3gn7kcLsNbXcLqXupK

Wow, this is really astonishing. I can't test it right now, but from the sound of it it seems to be. A major improvement.
Is this rendering with the sgx now?

This is very good! I played far to much Tekken 3 last night when I ought to be asleep Now there is, what, four different GPUs, right? Is it possible to get a quick rundown for the intlecktualy shallenged (i.e. me) of which one is which, and why one would use the one or the other? As in "gpuPCUX3.so is the fastest, but may cause artifacts on certain games. gpu123.so is very accurate, but slow. gpuMRYXMAS.so is the new lovechild of Exophase and Notaz, born on christmas day and will save the world" or something like that?
Or maybe it is already in the readme, and I just made an ass of myself? Oh, well...

Bravo!Something to fiddle with while the Turkey percolates through me later. I will check some games that was notworking [crashing emu] in previous versions of emu like: - need for speed 3 Need For Speed 3 (PAL/Bin+Cue) worked fine for me for some time, just a little choppy until R11, pretty much perfect then.

What's your overclock and OPP? Mine crashed at 1 Ghz on OPP4, but was fine at 0.95 Ghz on OPP3, or 1.05 Ghz on OPP5 I could be wrong here cause am pretty thick, but am sure ive read somewhere on the board that the way that pcsx rearmed was built that its designed to work better at lower clock speeds (650 was the max recomended in the thread am sure) and overclocking will actually be counter productive and cause more stability issues rather than speeding up the emu.

Or maybe it is already in the readme, and I just made an ass of myself? Oh, well... It's in the readme. In short, use the default one (builtin_gpu), it's Exophase's one, fastest and most accurate. If you hit bugs (Gran Turismo 2 and Xenogears reported so far), switch to gpuPCSX4ALL.so (different set of glitches) or gpuPEOPS.so (slowest but well tested on PC emus). gpuGLES.so is experimental OpenGL ES plugin that uses SGX, but it's too unstable to be useful.
