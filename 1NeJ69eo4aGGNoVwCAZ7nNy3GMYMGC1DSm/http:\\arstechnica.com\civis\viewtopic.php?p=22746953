This is absurd. I mean, is he going to order a vodka martini in some dirt bar in Gofuckyourselfville, Bratislava? No, and so to see him order a beer instead is perfectly understandable. Likewise, if he's in some hojillion-dollar casino with other hojillionaires, he's probably not going to order a fucking beer, even if it's your personal favorite ultra-micro-super-special-hipster brew that only you and three other guys know about. He's going to order a fucking vodka martini.CONTEXT, people. Don't just force Heineken in there for goddamn product placement.BitPoet wrote:(hint: largest american-owned brewery is Sam Adams)Isn't Sam Adams (aka Boston Beer Company) owned by Anheuser-Busch, which is, in turn, owned by a BELGIAN company (InBev)?I thought Yuengling was still the largest American beer.

Ok, I had to look it up, because my curiosity is piqued now.Quote:D. G. Yuengling & Son is the oldest operating brewing company in the United States, established in 1829. It is one of the largest breweries by volume in the country, and as of 2011 is the largest American-owned brewery.source

I like Heineken. It's obviously a light beer without a whole lot of character as far as malt or hop profile, but it's pretty decent, in my opinion. It's certainly unique, with a bit of a honey-like finish, though I don't think honey is actually in the ingredient list. The problem is those green fucking bottles. I'm convinced that beer in green bottles suffers more from being lightstruck than even clear glass. I never get a skunky Newcastle, for instance. I buy Heineken only in 12 packs, protected from light. It makes a world of difference.I also drink and brew stouts, porters, PAs, IPAs, brown ales, and many other styles. I'll try anything once. I understand why Heineken has a bad rep, and it's because of packaging, mostly. Heineken married the green bottle. It's completely associated with the brand. I think it's really dumb that they don't divorce it, along with a healthy advertising campaign explaining what lightstruck means and why they've chosen to retire the green bottle, but I don't ever expect them to do so.Anyway, I don't drink Heineken for any brand conscious decision, and I practically never order it in a bar (because it's almost always skunked when you get it in a bar). However, it's really pretty decent before it spoils. They just happen to package it in a way that it frequently does spoil.As far as the Bond movie franchise goes, yeah. It's been an advertising vehicle since day one, so I'm not sure why this should surprise anyone.

Slivovitz, retsina, ouzo, etc.Speaking for me, I know that fighting changes in image is tilting at windmills. People/values change and the creators wish to market toward those folks.Still, Bond as a movie character, gained popularity in part because of timing and social changes, such as the arrival of "the pill" and the Cold War. It was a time when hard drinking was more acceptable, along with smoking cigarettes. It was a unique moment for a unique character and, for many people, that character defined who James Bond is. And he's a hard working licensed killer who drink, smokes, and gets all the women he wanted.

Belgian beer is Belgian Beer(tm). It's a fairly unique take on beer and doesn't taste like anything else except beers that copy them. Czech beer is the best stuff that pretty much everyone else in the world identifies as "beer".

Thats like saying Mcdonalds makes the best hamburgers because thats what the world thinks of when you say the word hamburger.

If you think Pilsner is the only thing brewed there, you're ignorant. That being said, it's still the beer that 98% of the planet would identify as beer and they're the best at it. It's even better than the German stuff, though I can at least easily get Paulaner on tap. Pale ale (they do that too, just didn't invent it) and lager dwarf every other type of beer put together and multiplied a few times. For a reason - when it's nice, it's rather nice stuff and very quaffable. Trappists and stouts have a time and place, a good Pils works anywhere.

I know that I certainly wasn't consulted.I think that huge parts of the population of the world, from beer connoisseurs down to the blue collar Joes drinking their paycheck away in a local bar, are going to have vastly different views of what constitutes "beer." Of course, many of them aren't pretentious assholes, so they won't limit it to one type of one nation's beer.Case in point: for me, Belgian and German beers embody everything I consider to be "beer." At least, as much as that can be said, given the wide variety of beers available in both countries.Actually, that brings up an interesting point... are Czech beers so severely limited in variety that they can all be lumped under one generic "type"? Because, for example, you could't really say that German beer is what "pretty much everyone else in the world identifies as 'beer'," because it would make no sense. Which German beer? A Märzen-style Oktoberfest? A Doppelbock? A Kristallweizen? All of those are completely different styles of beer (and all equally delicious, IMO).So are Czech beer so homogeneous that there is no variety, or what? Because that doesn't sound like "the best fucking beer in the world" to me.

1. I like Heineken. I don't love it, but I'll drink it. I probably wouldn't drink it if I was a globe-trotting badass with a license to kill, though.2. As others have said, America has tons of good beers and--at least around here--they're available at almost any corner liquor or even grocery store.3. Everyone in this thread needs to read the "How to Drink" chapter of this book.
