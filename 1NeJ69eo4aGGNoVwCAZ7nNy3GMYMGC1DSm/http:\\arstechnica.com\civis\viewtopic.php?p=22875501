Torchlight 2 is $20. <br /><br />TL1 is a rather overrated game that gets a free pass because it was made by a tiny team in a year, but they seem to have fixed almost all of my complaints for TL2. The one thing that made me confident is that TL1 really &quot;gets it&quot; in terms of basic ARPG hooks and playability. It was the other stuff that needed improving and they did it. I don't regret the $20 I spent on that one either, since it helped them to make this game. <br /><br />Diablo 3 looks amazing and is a long term game for me. Something I will play for months and probably years, like LoL or WoW.</div><br />This is still the best option. I personally won't have time for both myself, but If time wasn't an issue I am quite certain that I would get least $20 worth of entertainment from TL2 and at least $60 worth of entertainment from D3.

              I'm pretty sure I'll play D3 and then pick up TL2 in another 6-9 months when I'm looking for a different distraction.   Honestly they should just delay TL2 another six months and then release, if they are at all able to.  They'll sell more.

              Is there more info anywhere about the classes, skills etc, than what's on the official website?<br /><br />The classes seem a bit gimmicky to me, compared to what they had in the first game. For melee you have the Berserker, who seems to be limited to dual wielding fist weapons, is that the case? Then you have what looks like a steampunk 2H warrior with some magic abilities? Am I reading this correctly?

              I wouldn't over worry about the classes in TL2. The game is fully modable, in theory a good modder can put together a better set of classes and abilities than what they'll launch.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Paul M wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'm pretty sure I'll play D3 and then pick up TL2 in another 6-9 months when I'm looking for a different distraction.

Bonus is that TL2 will be on sale by that point. Their loss for trying to directly compete with D3.

              At last we got back to the topic. About half way through the thread it looked like this was just created for a second place for people to complain about D3 being server side.<br /><br />I played D2 for only a short while, and the annoyances of the game made it nearly impossible for me to play. If I'm not playing hardcore, then I don't want gameplay that means I have to reroll if I make a mistake.<br /><br />I just started TL and after looking over the class skills, I went with what I thought would be fun. Later I found that I had chosen just about the most powerful build in the game. Since I'm a casual player and not likely to play TL again once D3 comes out, that is just peachy to me. I'm rolling with a freaking army, as in &quot;You mess wit' me, you mess wit' ma whole family!&quot; only in this case the family is already dead and reanimated as skeletons. OK, that got weird there at the end.<br /><br />Anyway, from what I played of D3 in the open beta, I think it will be better then TL1, and possibly better then TL2. It depends on how the balance is handled in both of them. I like that in D3 you don't have &quot;builds&quot; per se, just how you are currently configured with your abilities. <br /><br />Even in TL1 I've been bitten by some design choices I didn't agree with. In many games, if you sell something and change your mind you can buy it back. If you haven't left the store interface, you can often buy it back at cost, since it's like you just put your item down on the counter. In TL1, I accidentally sold a unique helmet I was wearing. I had swapped it out with one in my inventory to see the change, then, when I meant to right click it to reequip it, I shift clicked instead. The helmet sold for 200g. Well, I hadn't left the store interface, so I figured I would just buy it back, no harm/no foul. Except the buying price was over 14,000 gold. Bwhaaa? At that point, I cursed that I wasn't able to go all Skyrim on him and slaughter the merchant. A few other times, I've almost done this when the merchant, inventory, and pet inventory screens are all open. I'm used to shift clicking to quickly move things from the pet's inventory to my own, but that is a big no-no if the store is up as well.<br /><br />Also, small improvements from TL1 to TL2 that I've seen in the screen shots have given me hope. In TL1, the hotkeys were 1-0. Hitting 0 or 9 with your left hand during a fight isn't fun. In TL2, the screenshots show 1-5 and q-t, which is MUCH nicer. I would still prefer D3's solution as to just making everything rebindable in the GUI.<br /><br />Anyway, this kind of thread would be best once both games are released.

There were a lot of 'style' mods, many purely graphical ones, a whole bunch of what are essentially cheats, and a handful of realistic, useful, and well-thought-out ones.<br /><br />Here is a list of most of them: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://sites.google.com/site/ultimatemodlistwiki/Complete-Mod-List">https://sites.google.com/site/ultimatem ... e-Mod-List</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Ones that I've used and/or found useful:<br />TorchCam - allows more functional camera, including zooming out more<br />TorchLeech - mod manager, very easy to use<br />Max Level mods - not sure exactly which one I used, but it increased your max level, and the max levels of your skills.  Some of them were ridiculous, but fun.<br />Ferret pet - purely graphical, but better than cat or dog <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />Various SV quest-givers, like Starch The Monster Hunter, Moog The Enchanter, etc.  They cause mini-bosses and special baddies to appear in each level.<br />Gem Icon Mod - This made the gems in your inventory larger, and superimposed roman numeral icons on them, so you could easily see their ranks.<br />Respec Potion - should have been included in the original game.<br />Extra Vendors - NPCs that sold gems, maps, etc, that the original NPC vendors didn't.<br />Potion stacking - Don't remember the name of this, but it was quite useful.  Made you able to stack 99 potions/inventory rather than 20.<br />The Horde Mode - Spawns about 10x enemies.  Fun, especially in addition to the max level mod, but gets kind of easy fairly quickly, unless you're in the Shadow Vault.<br /><br />And I admit, I did use a &quot;never disenchant&quot; mod for a while.  I got tired of spending hundreds of thousands of gold on an item just to make it useless.<br /><br /><br />But in any case, there were a lot of mods.  And TL2 supports much of the same modding.  So I'm looking forward to it. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

The first half is modifications to the existing classes, and in the second half you start seeing entirely new character classes.  I haven't tried most of those, so I can't recommend/discommend any of them specifically, but feel free to try whatever sounds fun.

It was something about a purple potion...I don't remember what it did anymore.  Something about merchant behavior, I think.

              Why have we got such a wave of APRGs after such a draught is the good question to ask. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />As for me, I'll get both D3 and TL2.<br /><br />And I just (gladly) paid to get into the Path of Exile closed beta, a future free to play game, with an utterly ridiculous - and really interesting - talent tree.<br /><br />And I also just kickstarted GrimDawn, being made by the former Titan Quest guys.<br /><br />Life is good!  <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/big_grin.png" alt=":D" title="Big Green" />

              Yes, it's nice to have some decent ARPGs coming out for a change. I'm not really interested in PoE or Grim Dawn though, from what I've seen of those games. I just pre-ordered TL2 though, and along with D3, they should keep me busy for a good while. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

It's what I do, anyways.  I've probably played through T1 12-15 times.  No way I could have done that with just the stock characters.<br /><br />And I'll note that there are certainly mods that break the game.  I admit to using a few of those at times.  There was a nice little &quot;never disenchant&quot; mod for T1 that I used because I thought it was silly that enchanting increased both the price and chance of failing.  Should be one or the other, IMO, or just a different balance.  I personally like the &quot;constant low chance of disenchant [i.e. 5% or something], increasing chance of doing nothing, and increasing price&quot;, but nobody asked me when they were making the game. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/wink.png" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

              You purists crack me up. Sometimes modding is what makes the game awesome, look at NWN. The base game was mediocre at best, but the online modding community turned into ambrosia. I used to play capture the flag multiplayer... in an RPG game. Very drastic direction from the original genre of the game. Modding in TL2 will be highly dependent on the community as well as the API and editing power of the game files. It's what has me the most curious about TL2, the base game doesn't look as interesting as D3.

The original Half-Life is one of those excepts. I played mods on that engine for years [CS, DoD, NS]. I fully expected Quake 3 to follow, but I think the bubble burst about this time. Source engine failed to deliver anything near it's previous output. I could only really point to Minerva and Gary's Mod as being a success.<br /><br />For me, Mods mean almost nothing because the signal-to-noise ratio is so low.

I didn't find either one of them mediocre--they were fabulous.<br /><br />The problem with player-created content is that you have to wade through oceans of drek to find the tiny handful of mods &amp; campaigns worth even looking at.

The base game was mediocre at best, but the online modding community turned into ambrosia. I used to play capture the flag multiplayer... in an RPG game. Very drastic direction from the original genre of the game. Modding in TL2 will be highly dependent on the community as well as the API and editing power of the game files. It's what has me the most curious about TL2, the base game doesn't look as interesting as D3.</div><br /><br />There's a difference. NWN mods fixed rule inconsistencies, bugs, or added onto the base package with extras from the PnP manuals and campaigns. You're talking about completely revamping classes and abilities. Those types of things are hit and miss at best, and more likely completely unbalanced and worse than the originals.

              After an attempt to try the the first quest in the TL2 beta, I've a bad feeling. It's been a while since I played TL1, so I've no idea what's going in this game. I was assaulted with close to a dozen tips - none of which I can remember due to information overload. The controls weren't explained. I received a collar for my dog as a reward, yet I can't equip it and the game doesn't tell me why. I hit a load screen that basically froze the game up for several minute, so I closed the program. Did I mention that none of the enemies attacked?<br /><br />TL2 didn't leave me with a good impression.

You complain that you don't know what you're doing, but didn't bother to read/remember any of the intro tips given.  The backstory, so far as I know, isn't really done.  Most of the beta videos I've seen haven't really detailed a lot on that aspect other than getting general quests to 'go to $place, find $item, return', etc.  The controls are pretty much the exact same as any other ARPG [you know, just like D3].  You click to move, click on enemies to make them die, click on items to pick them up, etc.  Any item you find will have a tooltip explaining what it does, and while the majority of text on each tooltip is white, any requirements for the item that you don't meet are in bright red, so it's not exactly difficult to tell what you don't fit [unless you're colorblind or something].  Can't vouch for the loading issues.<br /><br />All in all, sounds like you've decided to come up with a purely negative review based on nothing at all.

Go look up &quot;information overload&quot; and keep reading it until you understand it. The reason you're unsure where to go is that you didn't read/remember what I said in the first place.

The amount of concepts introduced in the first couple of minutes of gameplay is staggering. It's also been 3 years since the last game, so even old players probably have played a shitload of games since then. I seem to remember T1 did this much better - but I'm not quite sure. <br /><br />Yeah, D3 did this much better. The training and concepts are well done and well spaced. They make sure you know the basic controls and understand navigation points before throwing in the entire kitchen sink. Runic is also showing just how new they are to mixing in story with gameplay.

Even teaching you to left click on a creature to attack is paced, on every level up, you only get one or two new things to try out. You're encouraged to press &quot;s&quot;, click the blinking icons and watch the tooltip. It's as good as it gets.

              It's weird, but from preview videos I'm finding torchlight 2 a lot more exciting. I'm a sucker for cartooney art styles, and TL2 seems more cartooned than D3.<br /><br />Though to be honest, character classes look more interesting in D3.<br /><br />I'm probably going to go TL2 because I want to mod the game.

TL1, however, gets a free pass for being cheap and fun - not any other reason. The same goes for Orcs Must Die, even though I had enough of it to to have no interest in the sequel. I bought both on sale, so the very cheap price does influence my opinion.<br /><br />At the current price of 15 bucks, TL1 isn't so impressive. For new players, paying 20 bucks to get TL1 and 2 is impressive.</div><br /><br />Yeah, the low price is kinda appealing, even if when you consider that time put into a game is actually far more costly than the purchase price. <br /><br />Kinda the spirit of computer games back in the era of the original diablo or starcraft before this stuff became big business.

              Has anyone any experience modding Torchlight at all? I tried the demo out and one thing that struck me is that it seems that you can't throw a heal to another player due to the inability to select friendly players.

      Let&#39;s see ...<br /><br />2002ish, Dungeon Siege 1:  played it in a day and a bit, got to the end with all my purple gear, then tried to run it again, I couldn&#39;t face it. Instant ennui.<br /><br />Dungeon Siege 2:  Played it, &#39;oh dear, more of the same&#39;, and got a way through it before putting it aside and never looking at it again.<br /><br />Space Siege:  bought it in a fit of madness, and simply hated it.<br /><br />Diablo 1, it stayed full price for ages, I didn&#39;t get it until it was $3 from Good Old Games &#40;GoG&#41;, installed it, barfed at the graphics and left, in about 2009 I think.<br /><br />Torchlight -- $5, RAVE reviews, bought it, hated the &#39;isometric viewpoint&#39;, reminded me of Dungeon Siege, and then I went into a kind of coma where I couldn&#39;t possibly bear to even try with the damned game.  Put aside, never looked at it again.<br /><br />Diablo 3 : &quot;yawn&quot;, I said to myself, from its announcement through to the seemingly endless &quot;beta&quot;.  The day of release, I find the local shop-bought boxed version is -less- to buy than the online &#39;digital download&#39; version &#40;$AU59.99 is less than $US60, amirite?&#41;, so I bought it, knowing it was &#39;isometric loot hunting like dungeon siege&#39;.<br /><br />Except you&#39;re an overpowered monster killing machine!  It&#39;s just great fun mowing down the critters.  Then a special boss comes along, provides a few moments of &#39;oh oh, I might die&#39;, but hey, even if you do die, it doesn&#39;t matter, you just go back, re-arrange your powers to &#39;something appropriate&#39; and have at it.  I&#39;ve died about four times, once due to lag, twice due to not understanding the Skeleton King boss fight, and once due to multiplayer lunacy.  Each time it was painless, hopped straight back into the action.<br /><br />I didn&#39;t suffer any of the &#39;server unavailable&#39; crapola that upset 99.9% of their audience, and I&#39;ve never been disconnected from a session &#40;but I only play in 60-90minute chunks&#41;.<br /><br />With the town-portal, I don&#39;t have to worry about the tedious &#39;get all this junk back to the vendor&#39;, port, dump loot, port back, and I&#39;m back where I was, with the monsters patiently lurking in the dungeon, ready to HULK-SMASH when I get around to it.<br /><br />I&#39;ve easily put six or so hours into this game &#40;versus 15-20 minutes into Torchlight 1&#41;, and thought &quot;I wonder what powers I&#39;ll get next&quot; or &quot;lets roll &lt;x&gt; they look good&quot;, trying out various fighting and powers, pets and sidekicks.  It&#39;s got heaps of potential.  I see these pictures of people with &quot;700damage&quot; weapons and read of 21,000+DPS, and think &#39;wow, I&#39;m up to what, 70dps at L11, and having fun, how EPIC is this going to be when I get a LOT of gear!&quot;<br /><br />Played multiplayer with some friends from WoW who just got the game on the weekend, and it was great, truly rocking fun!  We got loot, smashed through quests, killed stuff that would have wiped the floor with any of us solo.  It was all too short by the time we finished.  40 minutes of multiplay at L9, got more more gold than I&#39;d earned in five or so hours of solo.<br /><br />D3&#39;s internet requirement is no more &#39;damaging&#39; than MMORPG &#39;always on&#39; requirements, it just makes things simpler for all.  ESPECIALLY the reduction in cheaters, and the AH, whilst a bit of a pain, is almost usable &#40;why can&#39;t I search for specific names of gear, dammit!&#41;, enabling even relatively poor people to equip characters with level-appropriate gear for a song.<br /><br />Saying &quot;I love it&quot; would be hyperbole.  I&#39;m imagining that I&#39;ll be playing this game for a long long time, as I investigate the various playstyles and weapon choices.  One really rare drop should enable me to block-buy all the Stash unlocks; I don&#39;t HAVE to engage in the tedious Crafting charade.  The shared-between-all-characters stash means that my high level guys can equip my low level guys with their rubbish drops, and make the low level guys -rock-.  Win-win!<br /><br />D3 really is polished and smooth, and an amazing game experience.  I loved Dungeon Siege -- once.  I think D3 will have much more repeatability.
