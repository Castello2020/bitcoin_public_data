There would be 12 intra-conference games a season versus 6 division games. That would be 6 or 3 per half on average. 5 may be statistically much higher than 3 but it's not that much when you can only count in integers, and as mentioned it balances out the teams with 4 in the first half.Yep, your right, division. AFC North.

People are already proclaiming that the NE Patriots have the easiest schedule in the league. I really do find such statements silly, you don't know how teams are going to play. But there are a few interesting points that are at least not detriments. Their bye is week 9, a nice way to split the season in half. No teams have byes before facing Patriots. No one gets 2 weeks to prepare.3 of the last 4 games are at home and against teams from warm weather climates.

I don't live in Minnesota so I don't know the local side of the story, but whats the hold up with the stadium deal? It seems like the Vikings are doing what they were asked to do. I would hate to see the Vikings be sold and moved to LA.

Poor NFL. They go out of their way to prop up the Saints after Katrina and things go horribly wrong.Yes, I do think that the league sometimes tweaks things to make certain teams look better in some years. I know it's crazy conspiracy theory but I do believe it.

The NFL has done everything possible to punish and destroy the Saints because the NFL doesn't like them or their owner.

They're reporting that the statute of limitations has passed if the allegations are true, it happened in 2002-2005. So they aren't going to be in any criminal trouble. But the NFL can take whatever action they like. I also heard this morning that the door could still be open for civil suits from opposing coaches but that seems pretty silly to me.

And they do this through draft order and compensatory picks. That's it. Because your theory falls apart the moment you look at the Browns.

Underdog stories etc..Not that I think the league really gets involved much, compensatory picks fine - draft order to a large degree is formula driven... Not like some sports where the league is constantly rejecting trades, or others where you can go over cap by paying a penalty/fee.

It wouldn't shock me to find out he was the source of these leaks.

The Falcons have signed Asante Samuel. I know he's getting up there in years, but pass defense is definitely Atlanta's weak spot. I hope he can help not just on his own, but be a mentor for Dunta Robinson and Brent Grimes.http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/78533 ... ources-say

No-one watches it on TV and hasn't for years, but it lets the players go to Hawaii and the residents of Hawaii see the NFL. They make billions every year, keep it going.Alternatively, make the winner of the Pro Bowl count for more than just who is "home" at the Super Bowl. That confers no real advantage that people will fight for. I don't know what, exactly, but I am sure the guys in the front office of the NFL can figure something out.

How to make the Pro Bowl more popular:- Make it the first game of the season- Make it a competition over some kind of trophy that's at least vaguely meaningfulIt's never going to be fully competitive, obviously, but at least if it's the first game of the season after a long, seven month drought, people will be interested in watching.

Either pay them to take one more game against the best there is to offer, and suffer the injuries that might come along with it,or get rid of it altogether. The players won't want to continue the farce, not after this last "game". I'd expect players to turn down the Pro Bowl in droves this next season.I don't think this will happen. There's no meaning to the game, and the stakes are too high. Just get rid of it.

I agree. It is probably the only sport that has a huge probability of a career ending injury on every play when played "for real". Just announce the all stars, give them a bonus or whatever, and be done.

I'd pay to have them 40 of the best players, elected by fans and peers, on camera for a one day scavenger hunt not unlike the 80's movie Scavenger Hunt. Team up. Survive. Win.Or have them all race NASCAR.

New idea for the pro-bowl. Each team is allowed to send a number of players such that a full team is made. Once the game is played the winners go home as normal but the teams that sent the losing players are allowed to cut the losers without having any of their pay for the next years count against their cap numbers.Instead of Pro-Bowl, we could rename it the "Job Bowl".
