Yes folks, I'm here today to tell you about a web-based game, Cookie Clicker (or Cookie Clicker 2, if you ran into the developer's first prototype now named "Cookie Clicker Classic.")http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/When you start the game, you're presented with a cookie icon. Click it and you receive one cookie. So far so good, right? Nope. You're never getting into the cookie production big leagues one at a time, son! The game has upgrades, structures that you buy (with cookies) to automate production, and a system of multipliers and bonuses. It can just run passively in the background once you have automation set up (great for overnight or work or whatever) but there's a way to "play" it as well, beyond just clicking cookies.This *is* a game about optimizing outcomes and has surprising depth beyond just "playing a spreadsheet." There's definitely that strategy aspect to it in terms of figuring out how to optimize your build, and how to continually optimize it as you go into and out of different phases of the game.It's still under active development and the last update added in the final "core game" structure as well as a number of tweaks. Dungeons are on track for the next update late this month or next month. What one does in a cookie dungeon is a mystery to me.The game has a full Wiki, which I won't link but you can easily find it as it's full of spoilers. I'd try to get through at least a few days before checking out what you're missing. Also, it would be better to avoid the change log as it contains spoilers.If you're having trouble understanding optimizations as you go along and can't find the efficient way to do things, there is an advanced mode:
Spoiler: show
It's called Cookie Monster mode and is activated by passing the game a snippet of Javascript (below) by means of a bookmark. Just put the following snippet into your bookmarks with the "address" being the code:Code:javascript: (function () {var jA = document.createElement('script');jA.setAttribute('type', 'text/javascript');jA.setAttribute('src', 'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js');jA.onload = function() { var jB = document.createElement('script'); jB.setAttribute('type', 'text/javascript'); jB.setAttribute('src', 'http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=2KRNm8Gm'); document.body.appendChild(jB);};document.body.appendChild(jA);}());This shows you precisely how much each structure is worth, as the values vary based on multipliers, and shows you the payout in terms of maximum efficiency. It also cleans up some of the interface (abbreviating millions, billions, trillions, quadrillions, etc.), color codes for efficiency and shows timers for certain events and other behind-the-scenes data.It's not cheating, but again, I'd recommend playing for a day or two before going into "advanced" mode. Once you've gone pretty far in the game, it does become VERY helpful, though.
So get to clicking!

I would guess dungeons is looking for more of a Candy Box style, but I kind of like the merciless numbers of this one.This is the best telecon game ever.

Impressive, but the world hasn't been entirely cookie-fied yet!My lifetime total is over 4 quadrillion, so 1.5x the total volume of crude oil produced of all time, 360x the volume of water in Sydney harbor or a cube of cookies 3.5 miles to a side..

Oh, and to be clear, even though the game is developed by a Frenchman, they are using the N. American standard numbers, so Thousand, Million, Billion, Trillion, Quadrillion, etc. and not the Euro-style Thousand, Million, Milliard, Billion, etc... No "thousands of millions" nonsense here! daishi5

I need to make more cookies.

Oh good grief there goes my Thursday. Took my a while to notice that selling things is not worthwhile. Where does it show how many cookies you get back when you sell something?

OK, well at least this has an ending... sort of. Unless you want to just go for the points I'm hovering around 19bbn/sec and biding my time before the first reset. I'm trying to get 100 antimatter condensers first, for the full set of 'cheevos.

Where does it show how many cookies you get back when you sell something?It doesn't. Selling stuff is generally never worthwhile, unless you're just dumping out a bunch of one building to get a certain number of a different building (basically trying to sell buildings of type Y to get buildings of type X to get an achievement or unlock faster.)Through different phases of the game, different tactics are more useful than others. Certainly "baking by hand" is not going to be very useful... except in certain circumstances when it is.

I'll just leave this here. Throw this into your browser's Javascript Console:Code:var autoCookieClick = setInterval(Game.ClickCookie, 1);That takes care of that pesky cookie clicking, and you can focus on buying things and clicking golden cookies.To stop:Code:clearInterval(autoCookieClick);

The "Cookie Monster" add-on, with the code in spoiler tags above, already does that for you... It even highlights the best values.

How do you get the cookie monster thing working in Chrome? I created a bookmark and dumped the java into the address, and it ran I think when I go to the bookmark but the page doesn't open, and opening the page again manually seems not to work either.nevermind, figured it out.

What's the differnce between "angered" and "appeased," anyway? I don't notice any difference, except the occasional change to the golden cookies. Feel free to answer in spoiler tags.

Spoiler: show
While angered all (most?) gold cookies turn to red cookies and can have negative effects. It's not anything to worry about if you're going the full automation route.Also the news headlines get a bit crazier as the matriarchs make their anger known.
