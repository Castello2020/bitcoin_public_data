Also: Red Dwarf: Most seasons are too dated visually, and the static conversation parts are very boring. Frankly, I liked the novelizations better.

In fairness, Red Dwarf was dated when it was new. They went for that low-budget aesthetic because they were really low budget. I personally like them better before they added all the CGI crap.The dialogue either works for you or it doesn't. British comedies aren't for everyone.

I've never played a PnP role playing game. Sometimes I see other people playing them, and it looks interesting, but I've bothered to get into a group. Most fantasy books bore me, although oddly I love Tolkien's stuff, even the Silmarillion. I can program, but only at a hobby hacker level, and I completely suck at this JavaScript thing the cool kids are using.

I've never built my own PC.I, too, hate ST:TNG, even though I loved it during the original run. Also, I never liked the Borg. Ever. Ever. ST:E is vastly superior.I rejected most fantasy growing up.I never beat a single Zelda game.

Beyond the PS1 and the NES, I never could get myself interested in consoles. Controllers just don't work right for me once they got more complicated than that.

I'm more of a geek than a nerd.I suck at maths. I hate D&D.I don't like animeI can't program my way out of a cardboard box. The last programming class I took was in 8th grade. (Pascal)The last game console I owned was an Atari 2600.I like books.I like building things (esp. computers).I like networks, and servers, and all kinds of blinkin' lights.

I don't like the inconsistent definition of Nerd. I dislike LARP, online gaming, DnD I can only take in 6-8 month bursts every 3 years. Anime was cool when there was more signal less noise, but I can't be buggered anymore. Videogames similarly, but one or two a year still make it through. Cardgames tend to be more constant, but 1 year breaks are needed every 3-4 years. Coding: I can do algorithms, I never got to the point of being able to research API's or understanding frameworks or being able to set up chains. Databases I desperately want to understand better, but I always feel like I am missing some key thing. Right now modded Minecraft is my brainworm. I like math, calculus included. Otherwise, I'm somewhat been into Beer geekery mostly.

I'm the kind of person that once I start reading I'll have to finish it that night which of course makes the headache problem worse. Graphic novels don't have that effect on me, I have no idea why. But the last book I read cover to cover was The Black Dahlia. I've started a bunch since then but get stalled early on.A Wizard's First Rule, started 2011 on a plane trip to the in-laws got to chapter 11, shelved since then.First book in the Grand Admiral Thrawn trilogy, started Christmas got to chapter 4, then shelved.A couple Terry Prachet books, Neil Gaiman, Mercedes Lackey, and others grabbed from the humble e-book bundle were started but since shelved. Maybe my attention span is crap.

I reject nerd fashion. The only graphic t-shirts that I own, I only wear to the gym. I don't own a pair of cargo shorts/pants or a hoodie. I own one pair of blue jeans. Unless I'm going to the gym, I only wear shoes that are made of leather.

Casablanca, Citizen Kane, It's a Wonderful Life (I hate that fucking movie), etc. Classic films that I had no interest in seeing, but felt obliged just because they are such cultural touchstones. I probably won't ever see them again, but I am glad that I at least have watched them once and know what people are talking about.

I just don't care for the band Rush. When I was in school, all the really nerdy people thought Rush was the best band in the world. Rush gets a mighty big meh from me. Geddy Lee's voice just annoys me for some reason.

Quite surprised (and relieved), there are a few people who didn't enjoy ST:TNG. I've always wondered if I "should" like it, but for some reason I never could. Glad I'm not the only one. Never finished Zelda games, either. Which makes me realize, that the "nerd" part of me, personally, is more about the technical/gadgetry stuff. I just like owning computer products, and consumer electronics. I've built my own computer, I play games, I just recently purchased good headphones, keyboards, etc.

The techie/gadget side of me misses the Sony Store circa 1997-2000. Also the Viacom store down the street, which had a dedicated Star Trek section alongside other Viacom/Paramount/Desilu entities.

I would posit that I'm the unnerdy nerd? I love DnD (3.5 rules)I love St: TNGI game on my PC almost exclusively. I still build my own PC's. I love reading, love Terry Goodkind, RR Martin, The Wheel of Time fucking guy. I CAN math, and how, and Organic Chemistry I'm getting pretty good at. Calculus is a math I think everyone should take. It makes math interesting. Cowboy Bebop and my collection of every Miyazaki Movie should tell you I care for Anime quite a bit. (Fuck Minmei)But I don't look it at all. Is there a "nerdy" look? I had a girl on okcupid tell me she didn't think she would get along with me because I wasn't nerdy enough. I stole a comment from Ars and told her that it wasn't my fault I only rolled a 3 for Charisma. She didn't get the joke...There are very few things I dislike that are considered nerdy. RenFest, LARP...shit like that I have no interest in.

I did like the new movie though.
