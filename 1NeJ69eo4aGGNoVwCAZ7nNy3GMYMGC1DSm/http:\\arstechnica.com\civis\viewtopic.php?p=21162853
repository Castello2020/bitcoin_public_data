You don't like 'em, and I respect that. I'm not a gun nut and I'm not advocating that you should be one either. I'm not saying that everyone should know how to shoot a gun, or take one apart and clean it, or learn to tell the difference between various weapons and types of ammunition. All I'm saying is that it doesn't hurt to know how to disable a potentially dangerous piece of equipment that's relatively common place (even in countries without a "gun culture"). Your example of taking a gun from an LEO to check if it's loaded is obviously hyperbole. But you don't know if you might one day find yourself in a situation where a firearm is present and no one else is present that can disable it.I'm not saying that everyone should be FORCED to learn these things, obviously. I'm just saying that, in my opinion, it's a useful piece of information that--even if in an extremely unlikely range of scenarios--might prove life-saving. That's all.I'm not against guns, in fact when ever I hear of someone pushing a law to prohibit gun ownership I get really pissed. I don't want to own a gun but don't tell me I can't. The LEO example was my poor attempt at a joke. However, the odds me needing to know any such thing about guns are very slim. I do get offended when someone thinks I should learn about something they are into but I just don't give two shits about.

I wish I knew what the name of a knot I frequently use. I'll have to take a picture or something... maybe a movie. I use it to tie stuff down all the time... it makes it's own "pulley" so you can really crank down and get the rope tight.I've also "surprised" people in the past by showing that I can make a seat (with a stick) on one end of a rope (tie the rope onto the stick in the middle of the stick), sit on it (throw a leg over each bit of the T it makes so the rope is between your thighs), and pull myself up into a tree with the other end of the rope.

I have about 6 air hoses and easily a dozen extension cords in my shop. Not sure how to explain something so visual, but basically I use it to hang my cords and hoses on hooks. Pictures may be required, but it makes managing cords and hoses and easy one-handed affair.

A double figure-eight is a much better knot than a bowline in a lot of scenarios. It is more time-consuming to tie (unless it's on a bight, in which case it is just as fast and easy) and it becomes difficult to untie after it has been heavily loaded, but it is much more secure than a bowline. It is also a stronger knot since the radius of the curves in the rope within the knot is larger. Climbers love making fun of boyscouts who insist that the bowline is the solution to everything.

In that sense it's pretty much the same as when people start screaming for blood when someone accidentally leaves a kid in a hot vehicle. A lot of people are quick to clamor for vengeance over a tragedy that may have resulted from what was a momentary lapse of thought or judgment.Lounge - Forgotten children suffocating to death in cars (March 2009)Washington Post - Fatal Distraction: Forgetting a Child in the Backseat of a Car Is a Horrifying Mistake.

In this case, Lazarus Long is a man who lives for more than 2,000 years, drifts from planet to planet, and hates regimented lifestyles. To someone like that, the above list might seem like obvious sense. To the average human with a ~75-80 year lifespan, living in modern day western society, however, probably not so much.So, yeah, my "Stuff you really ought to know" list just got expanded by one: How to assess the motivation of fictional characters and, thus, evaluate what they're saying. I'd agree with you, except Heinlein said it himself in a commencement address. So Doesn't make him any less wrong.Fuck that weakass shit. The fact that most people are too complacent/incompetent/etc to develop and maintain a well-rounded skillset is not a valid point favoring the acceptability of being a "specialized" ponce who worthlessly flops around like a dead fish whenever nudged out of their 9-5 rat race. If only life was simple enough to specialize. Most techies spend their lives sitting at a cube and typing away for someone twenty years their junior who's busy making it rain while doing lines of blow off hookers. Someone's gotta do the bitch work, so I'm not about to shittalk that path in life, but it leaves deskmonkeys in a very poor position to hate on anyone who had what it takes to do more with their lives. Heinlein isn't talking about the "average human." The "average human" is a fucking joke whom the Lounge mocks daily for driving in the passing lane, putting ketchup on steak, watching Fox news, leaftycausting, and teaching creationism in schools. Heinlein is talking about a Man. The polymath "Renaissance Man" isn't some imaginary, impossible ideal. We have regulars here who are doctor-soldiers. We have regulars who simultaneously build houses, program computers, and hunt what they eat, all while singlehandedly raising kids. We have regulars here who design tools which save the lives of people you care about, we have regulars who design weapons to hurt the people who want to hurt you, we have regulars who teach special forces types their asskicking mcguyver skills, and they may very well be the same damn person.I'll be the first to admit that not everyone can be expected to simultaneously grant, change, and take life, but anyone claiming pursuit, possession, or application of a skillset necessary to do these things is somehow "wrong" will be looked upon with nothing but contempt, scorn, and disgust by those who embody the ideal Heinlein challenges humanity to achieve.While the "average human" can get by with a willfully limited skillset, such individuals make no lasting impact on society and are ultimately forgotten.All those examples you gave? Those people have done what they've done because they specialized to do what they're doing. DP trained and specialized as a Marine, then as a medic. He also does other things, and I'd bet he does them well. But ask him to make bread from scratch: plow and sew a field, know what it takes to grow several types of grain, know when to harvest, reap the crop, separate the grains, grind the grains to make flour, then make bread. After all, feeding yourself is an important part of life, and he's not your idea of the "average human," so he should be able to do it right? I'd bet money that he wouldn't be able to do it right now. Tom Foolery is also awesome, he's done a lot in terms of house building, child rearing, he could hunt a meal for sure, and has done various other impressive things. He's good at what he does, and he's good at other things, but I'm pretty sure if you put a bunch of unspun wool in front of him and asked him to produce a sweater, he wouldn't be able to. Being able to clothe yourself is important to life, but hey look, your second example of the ubermensch would fail at that. We all specialize. The ability to work as a society and to specialize is what has allowed us to achieve the things we have. If we didn't specialize we'd all be too busy trying to eek out survival to do anything beyond that. You seem to view specialization as meaning "I will do one thing, and one thing only for the rest of my life and never look beyond that." I think this view of specialization is wrong. Sure there are some people who do that, but most of the people I know are proficient in multiple areas, usually broken down by "work" and "hobbies." Most people I know have multiple hobbies, and are very invested in them and doing them well. And for work, most people grow in their careers, learning more, sometimes in the same field sometimes outside. This might seem to you to mean that these people don't specialize. I would bet that most smart people with multiple skills in various fields, if put on a desert island with a knife and a flint, will not be able to survive very long. Due to the time they've had to spend acquiring the skills they have, they did not spend any time on basic survival skills, because they have not had to. I don't need to know how an internal combustion engine works, and be able to build and maintain one, to drive a car. You don't need to know how to brew up a batch of enzymes and what surfactants and chemicals to mix together to get your clothes clean. John Doe down the street doesn't need to know how to produce analgesics to make his headache go away. If we all had to know everything, we'd all know nothing, especially as there are more and more scientific and technological discoveries that it becomes prohibitive to learn and know everything. I'm not advocating ignorance, or saying that people shouldn't strive to better themselves. I am saying that "specialization is for insects" is a fucking dumb thing to say, a statement that ignores the way society works and how we got to be so advanced.

Long argues against the specialization in one task, not general specialization.
