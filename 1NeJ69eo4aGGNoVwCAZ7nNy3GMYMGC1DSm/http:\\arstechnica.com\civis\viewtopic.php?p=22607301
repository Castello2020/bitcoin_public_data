In my mind, there's a scale. On the left side, it reads "Not cool, dude." On the right, "Cool." Now zoom in a bit towards the middle. See that there, a bit left of the center? "Emkorial's cube is 80% proxies," right there. Zoom out, pan left a couple of inches. Ah, there we go. "Wrong enough that I give a damn." Just checking. Somewhere further to the left you'll find "That's, like, stealing, man..." but you probably get the point.... Odd as I may feel defending someone who has been on my ignore list for quite some time and likely will remain there, there you have it.

If I was playing in an environment like that, I'd sneak in a proxy for a pokemon card just to fuck with people.

Gonna come down on Em's side here.I've got nothing against using proxies to construct a Cube, especially if the Cube is still being tested. Why splash out several hundred bucks when you're going to be replacing things? To get a bit more controversial, the original developers (Wizards) aren't getting any money for your fifth-hand purchases of 12 year old cards from retailers. As abrasive as Em can be, he certainly buys products from Wizards. Do you really owe RandomCardStore.com anything? I'm all for supporting my LGS but they're unlikely to have the all pieces for a Cube, even if they're well stocked. LGSes stock modern cards that are going to be used in competitive decks.Cubes are a communal game experience made up of people who already buy and play plenty of Magic. One of my favorite parts of the spirit of Cubes is how free-form it is. I've seen hardcore cubes that have $5000 in cards in them, but I've also played great Cubes that were proxied or contained reproductions or altered cards. You aren't building a Cube for personal gain, unlike normal Magic. My two cubes are made of real cards. However, if I wanted to make a sillier one or one constructed from older cards, I could definitely see making a proxy one. I've also been tempted to start creating cards to fit holes in Cubes.

I realize this is off-topic, but I've discovered a low cost way to play Apples to Apples. Just find the list of cards from the official game, and print them out at kinkos to play at home.Also, if you give them your copy of Apples to Apples that you paid money for a year ago to pay for the printing, it means you're actually playing for free!(I also figured out a really low cost way to watch DVDs)

I mean, you're only playing it, it's not like you're using it to enter into any tournaments or reselling it, so it's a victimless crime! I might be mistaken but I think that argument has been shot down by most respectable people...

80% is a bit high, but this is very much a case of abandon ware. Emkorial can literally not buy from the manufacturer that which he is proxying. It's not like he's proxying Innistrad cards. He is proxying cards that have been out of production and only available on the secondary market by mail order for not inconsiderable expense.Don't hate. Don't create bad metaphors. This is closer to ScummVM than hacked xbox360.

So… like I said, wrong on several levels:-	As pointed out, he’s using the same argument that pirates use to justify what they do in that he’s not making money off of it or reselling it so hey… who does it hurt? I’ll tell you who it hurts, everyone who plays the game. The secondary market is an important part of the economic system of the game. A key part of any ‘collectable’ game is the retention of value on the product. If everything was available at the same rate as commons nothing would be worth anything. If cards never went out of print or were lost or destroyed than cards wouldn’t be worth much. If no one buys cards on the secondary market and instead just goes down to Kinko’s and plays off proxies than that market tanks than that market dies and no one can reliably sell and buy cards, demand goes down, card values suffer. -	No one builds a cube that isn’t a fan of the game, it’s not a ‘new guy’ thing. Yet he’s willing to hurt the value of other players collections, hurt the secondary market that helps sustains the game, and by extension the company that makes the game. I can’t say I’m surprised given his history of posting about Magic. He shows up in every single thread to bemoan how <LATEST SET HERE> is the worst set they’ve ever printed and <NEW STRATEGY HERE> is completely dumb and only idiots play the game. Yet he is always there and apparently always still playing. -	He, if memory serves, essentially ‘charges’ people a pack to play with his fake cube for prizes. So his argument that he’s not using them for anything but casual person play falls apart there.-	It is, impact to the game or economics aside, just an all around scummy thing to do. Again, I understand that the occasional proxy is necessary and part of the game. Proxying a deck for testing purposes is fine, using a proxy for the reasons I listed before is no big deal, but having 80% of your 400 card cube be fake is none of that. His recent crowing about ‘low cost Magic’ makes it even worse since, as rafadavic pointed out, nearly any hobby is cheap if you counterfeit everything. I can ‘low cost video game’ with the help of the Pirate Bay all day long.-	For a guy who decries Spikes and tournament play at every corner his justification that he won’t spend money on a cube because he’s not going to get a financial return on it is laughable. With that same logic essentially only players on the competitive circuit should ever actually buy cards because they’re the only ones that stand to see a return on that investment through winning.He can do anything he wants, but let’s not pretend this is anything other than it is.

Rather everyone that plays put packs into the pot so that the winners gets something.Just like playing a $5 nickel poker game, he isn't charging unless he is taking a share as "the house" from the entry fee or each pot. And I'm pretty sure he isn't doing that. For example, you have 8 people and everyone puts in a pack cause that is the "charge" to play. If you then payout 4 packs to the winner, 2 packs to second place and 1 pack to third and fourth place you aren't netting anything as the house. If he happens to net positive packs over time I think it is because he is winning (which granted the odds are going to be slightly higher as the designer of the cube since you know every card that is and isn't in the pool) more than the average person, not because he is charging people to play...

It's fun to say.Also, it's relatively strong and very old without having anything that really duplicates anything else.Tolarian Academy wouldn't be a terrible one either. I know they try to somewhat limit the dollar value of these things though so I didn't want to go too crazy. Isle of Wak-Wak is like 30-40, Wasteland is whatever it's currently at (ie a lot), Maze is 25-30. Hell, foil Reliquary Towers are like 10.

So his argument that he’s not using them for anything but casual person play falls apart there.I don't charge anyone anything. All the players (including me) put in a pack and then we all play for them. I receive no special treatment, vig, or benefit from those packs. So no, my argument doesn't "fall apart", any more than people putting up $5 on a basketball game but not cutting the NBA in on the actionAnd around 30% of the drafts we play are with no packs in and just for fun, if a few of the players don't have packs and don't want to buy one. Quote:- As pointed out, he’s using the same argument that pirates use to justify what they do in that he’s not making money off of it or reselling it so hey… who does it hurt? I’ll tell you who it hurts, everyone who plays the game.Not that I'm pro piracy, but you are using the same false argument the MPAA and RIAA do: That if I didn't proxy, I would instead spend the $$ to get the real cards. I wouldn't. If I didn't proxy the cube, the cube would not exist. I would not spend any $$ on getting real copies. There is no "money lost" because no money would have been spent. As for "hurting the game", people quitting hurts the game. I (and I believe WoTC) would much rather have someone playing the game with proxies than not playing the game at all. And I have seen several players quit after a standard rotation due to the financial implications. That's not good for MTG. Quote:Yet he’s willing to hurt the value of other players collections, hurt the secondary market that helps sustains the game, and by extension the company that makes the game. This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard you say, and that's something. Proxies have NO VALUE. But somehow you think something with no value hurt the value of other peoples collections, hurts the secondary market, and hurts the game. I'm sorry, but I you believe that you are completely off your rocker. If you want to be butt hurt that I don't like Innistrad, go right ahead, but that's some olympic level extrapolation you got gong on to try and justify how I'm some demonic force attacking magic by making a cube. Going by your example, Monopoly devalues the US dollar because they don't use real $$ in the game. Also, your entire argument applies to people trading cards as well, since the secondary market does not make any $$ and in fact loses a sale every time a person trades for a card they need instead of buys it, but you seem to have no problem with trading. Quote:- For a guy who decries Spikes and tournament play at every corner his justification that he won’t spend money on a cube because he’s not going to get a financial return on it is laughable. With that same logic essentially only players on the competitive circuit should ever actually buy cards because they’re the only ones that stand to see a return on that investment through winning.I don't get a financial return on the cube. In fact, it costs me money, to make proxies and replace sleeves (which have a pretty terrifying failure rate at 450 cards being played among 8 players twice a week). And yes, I believe that if you don't want to ever play any sanctioned tournament, proxy away. If your choices are proxying or not playing at all, I don't see the harm in proxying. You want to proxy all 100 cards in your ED deck, go right ahead. And like I said, the cards have a collectible value (hence CCG), and proxies do not effect that collectible value at all. Proxies also fail to provide the full playing utility of real cards since you can't use them in sanctioned tournaments.

Quote:t is, impact to the game or economics aside, just an all around scummy thing to do.You are of course entitled to your personal opinion, but there is no rational for why it is "scummy", other than people who forked over $800 to build a super friends deck being pissed other people aren't spending a small fortune of card that become close to worthless 2 years out. If you want to prove how much of an elite MTG player you are and spend thousands of dollars buying decks and traveling to tournaments and drooling over how many Planeswalker points you have, go right ahead. I just want to play MTG. Quote:If he happens to net positive packs over time I think it is because he is winningMy win rate isn't spectacular, contrary to popular theory, building the cube doesn't make you a grand master at drafting it. There is (by design) a lot of balance among the colors, so I can't go "Man, I know I totally tricked out white, so I'm drafting that every single time", not to mention the huge amount of variance in card distribution when we create the packs to draft. I win my fare share, but I am far from the best player to play my cube.

I have friends who have the cards and I use their cards to play casual MTG. Seems like a working system to me. No proxies found anywhere.

Quote:Obviously they can, just not in a sanctioned tournament setting. See above for how that actually has some fucking value.They can't be used as real cards in any situation where the real card has value. You cannot sell it, trade it, or use it to play a sanctioned tournamentQuote:Obviously you DO want the cards, you just choose not to pay for them.I want the playability of the cards in a casual environment. That's worth nothing. I don't want the value of the card. Quote:And foil Hanna, Ship's Navigators are $50 because they see SO MUCH play in Legacy and Vintage right?No, it's because they see play in commander, which is (wait for it) a fucking sanctioned formatQuote:no. i'm having a shit of a time finding any supporting links at work because of fucking websense, but it's pretty well accepted that wizards sells way more packs to casual players than to tournament playersI'm not proxing Doomed Travelers or Deciever Exarchs's. Wizards isn't losing any pack sales off my proxy Mox's and Beta Duals. Quote:I have friends who have the cards and I use their cards to play casual MTG. Seems like a working system to me. No proxies found anywhere. I I had friends who wanted to loan me their power and other cards worth several thousand dollars to play in my cube, I would gladly accept them. Quote:Goalposts successfully moved! Wizards has said several times that their primary interest is growing the game. Fuck, their entire philosophy behind D20 was that they could make $$ if they gave a away the base concepts of the game and increased the players base. Given the choice between having more people play with proxies or less people play the game at all, I'd wager WoTC isn't losing any sleep over proxied casual games. Quote:Your quarrel is with the degree he does this, not whether he does it at allHis quarrel is with me because I'm not a WoTC nuthugger and will call a set shit when it is, and they've had a real long run of shit lately, so instead of actually discussing it, it's easier to blame the person saying it.

You're using someone's IP, that they spent money to develop. Real cards have at some point rendered revenue to WotC, paying them for their investment in producing a quality product. By proxying the vast majority of your cube, you're deriving value from WotC's IP, for which they charge, without anyone ever having paid for use of it. Your stance that the possession of a particular card having no utility is pretty self-defeating. If you didn't find value in having them in your cube, you wouldn't proxy the cards.

You go all-out aggro every post, and that's why you end up getting dog piled. Chill out about it and be less indignant about the proxy thing. You, your friends, your LGS are fine with it so don't try to convince the whole internet.Quote:This has nothing to do with your universally consistent opinion that everything is terrible.

You are railing against the moral equivalent of a huge music fan sharing mp3s of out of print albums with his friends.

If I didn't proxy the cards, I would not have the cube, and likely would have quit MTG by now. I fail to see how that "helps" the game. Quote:This has nothing to do with your universally consistent opinion that everything is terrible.This is how I know you are a troll. Because I don't like SOM, MBS, ISD, or DKA, my opinion on MTG sets is "universally consistent".

If I didn't play the cube, I would have quit MTG. In fact, 5 of the players of my cube ALREADY quit, and only came back to the game because of the cube. So I fail to see how remaining a player and brining 5 people BACK INTO MAGIC is "bad for the game"Quote:He hates the game anyways. Yeah, I hate the game so much I spend 6-8 hours a week playing it and 2-4 hours a week tweaking my cube. I must be a real masochist.

And scummy.When you're not getting the value for what you are playing, when you cannot trade the card, cannot sell the card, cannot play in sanctioned tournaments with the card, you are correct, I'm not paying. So you and Asmodan can take your holier than thou BS and stuff it. Yeah, I proxy a fucking LOT. Deal with it.

Anyway, moving on to actually PLAYING the game...Drafted possibly the worst deck possible last night. It ending up being basically a ramp deck with no ramp. Which played about as bad as it sounds. But I did win a pack and a Sever the Bloodlines playing Magic Blackjack

Quote:It's played in tournaments, my friend just won a EDH tournament at GP Baltimore. He won prizes and is in some video on a website. None of which he would have been able to do if he was playing with proxies.Which doesn't make it a sanctioned format. Random independent people handing out prizes for Five Color doesn't make it a sanctioned format anymore than random people playing EDH for prizes makes it sanctioned. So yeah, he might have been able to because whoever gave out the prizes can do whatever they want... because it's not a sanctioned tournament/format.Quote:If I didn't play the cube, I would have quit MTG.

So I fail to see how remaining a player and brining 5 people BACK INTO MAGIC is "bad for the game"At the absolute best it does nothing if all they are doing it playing your fake cube. 'Coming back to the game' by playing in a cube full of proxied cards doesn't do anything for anyone other than let you take advantage of a product without paying for it.

I guess it's easier to ignore facts and think in ignorant generalizationsI wasn't following these threads back in Lorwyn, but the only set I can remember you being remotely positive about was RoE. So out of 14 sets you liked one, yeah... you're a paragon of positivity. You're overwhelmingly negative about almost every aspect of the game and almost every set that is released. I'm obviously not the only one here that's noticed it, so recognizing the fact that you are generally negative isn't much of an 'ignorant generalization'.Quote:Yeah, I proxy a fucking LOT. Deal with it.And I (and others) still think it's a shitty thing to do, deal with that.

Quote:And I (and others) still think it's a shitty thing to do, deal with that.Fine. I (and others) don't. For the record, I personally don't give a shit what you think about it. So we'll leave it at that. Quote:Actually, this proxy thing is a huge personality shift.

I don't think there are cheap decks that *always* win, if they always won, they wouldn't be cheap. There are cheap decks that can occasionally win against much more expensive decks. I agree with you, sanctioned tournament magic is way to expensive.And seriously, that was what, a decade ago?Quote:So out of 14 sets you liked one, yeah... you're a paragon of positivity.I guess you couldn't bother reading what I wrote and risk shattering your false impression of me. If you did, you would read where I said I LIKED Lorwyn, Eventide, Morningtide, Shadowmoor, All of Alara block, Zendikar, and ROEI'm no math wizard, but by my count, that means I liked 9 out of the last 14 sets. Sorry to dispel your simplistic notion of my MTG preferences. (I also immensly enjoyed the 6 sets before that, which puts the count of sets I liked to 15 of the last 20. Yeah, I'm such a hater)SOM sucks. MBS sucks. ISD sucks. DKA sucks. It just so happens that the standard environment right now is made up of sets I consider the worst ever to see print. That doesn't mean I'm a super pessimistic guy who hates MTG. It means I hate shitastic sets. And they just happen to be on a string of shitastic sets right now. They're entire philosophy behind ISD block seems to be "we don't care if the card sucks and is overcosted, if it fits a horror cliche, it's in". When you put "top down design" over "playable cards", you get shitty sets. Apparently they didn't learn their lesson from Kamigawa block, where they did the same thing, put design over fun, playable cards. I'm not an MTG apologizer. I love the game, and play quite a bit, but I'm not going to pretend a shitty set isn't shitty.

Depressing incidents from the 1-1 bracket in sealed:Game 1 - turn four Sorin, turn five Grimgrin.Game 2 - turn three Mentor of the Meek, turn four Bloodline Keeper.Shockingly, I did not manage to win either of those games.

Mentor of the Meek has risen quite high in my evaluation. Some removal (tap/etc) doesn't matter to him and if he isn't removed, he can take over the game like other bombs.
