Some other good ones:Drunk Nate Silver sends you a text at 2:00 am that says 'It's 9:32 am.' And that's when you read it.Drunk Nate Silver's McDonald's order comes out to exactly $5.00, after tax.Drunk Nate Silver starts to puke, grabs random container off bar, pukes right up to the rim of said container.Drunk Nate Silver shooting into the air in celebration, catching the bullets in a bucket as they come down.Lies, damn lies, and Nate Silver.

Quote:Ooo, I can repost from Reddit too!This thread is titled "picturs that actually made you LOL", which implies you've *already* seen them somehwere else, and has been the general theme throughout. So, what exactly is the problem with reposting pics from some other forum? Not everyone reads reddit, and certainly most don't read *everything* on reddit.
