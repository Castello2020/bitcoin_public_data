Also, I once was on a pedestrian bridge that passed almost over a carousel (in the image below it's to the right of the blue building). In looking down I saw a guy behind the bushes behind the building. His dog was running around in circles around him. I took a second look as it didn't look right and I see he's sporting an erection which he's quickly stuffed back in his pants as he started to walk away. I didn't have a cell phone, it would be quite a half mile run to run to the terminus of the bridge and do a 180 down on the grounds to catch up to him, and I had a young son a couple feet away who was occupied with something that didn't involve looking down. I wanted to yell at the guy but it went over so fast, and I had my kids around that wouldn't understand, that the whole event was over in less than 15 or so seconds before he disappeared. I'm really hoping he had to piss in the bushes and maybe had a piss boner, but everything seemed so odd. Weird. Hindsight is always 20/20. Damn.

In an ex-girlfriends neighbourhood there was a weird man. We would see him often waiting at the bus stop. He would always take the first bus that arrived, it didn't matter where it was going. If the first bus came from the other direction, he would cross the street to get on that bus. And once inside the bus, he would make motor noises. Very weird, a grown up man going "BROOOOOOMMMMM, BROOOOOMMMMMMM, BRROOOOOOMMM" inside the bus.Last thing we heared of him is that he jumped of a highway bridge.

There was a professor of photography at the university I attended. He was at all the bars, usually fairly well drunk. You'd see him at one bar, leave and go to another bar, and he'd be there, too. I never figured out how he did it.

There is a guy who wonders around between Canterbury and Faversham here in the UK in a whole Scottish getup including kilt and bagpipes. Sometimes on a monocycle, like the Darth Vader dude the whole internet knows about.

Back where I was born was this guy who was famous for collecting bottles. Seriously, he was constantly on his beat up bike, with plastic bags full of empty bottles hanging from the handlebars, and returning them for the deposit. Apparently he was an excellent student with top scores in everything. And he knew every name-day by heart. Nice guy, never caused any problems with anyone. Apart from the fact that police found 268 stolen bicycles at his home...

We had constant walkers, known as Pete and RePete in my hometown. I never knew if they were brothers or not. Older gentlemen. Always together, always similarly dressed in blue collar garb and ballcaps.EDIT: Well hell, they have a facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pete-and ... 2766929349

There was a woman who lived a few miles up the road from us (we passed her house every time we went into town) who had soda bottles, glass and plastic, of all sizes hanging from trees, on stuff like old tires in her yard, all painted with stripes/spots, etc.

For anyone interested just Google Earth Friend Gen. Rollerblading seems to be great for a body! Although she's probably lucky she's not big breasted. FreeRadical*

Well, we have Henry Earl here. He has been at it for many years now. His thing (one of them anyway) is to sing James Brown tunes and dance like James in exchange for money or a drink, doesn't really matter to him which. I used to see him quite often several years ago when I hung out downtown at various establishments. His JB act was actually quite good.

They were ogling too hard to pay attention to the power tools.At a guess - and I'm going to rely on blatant construction worker stereotypes here, because that's my prerogative as a Loungian - I'd say that they're absolutely fine with being able to wolf-whistle at a clothed woman on the street and tell her to "get 'em off, darling!" But when confronted with a naked woman who's perfectly happy and confident being that way, it becomes a threat to their egos, prompting a call to the cops to stop such brazen behavior!This scene from Easy Rider comes to mind:George Hanson: They're not scared of you. They're scared of what you represent to 'em. Billy: Hey, man. All we represent to them, man, is somebody who needs a haircut. George Hanson: Oh, no. What you represent to them is freedom. Billy: What the hell is wrong with freedom? That's what it's all about. George Hanson: Oh, yeah, that's right. That's what's it's all about, all right. But talkin' about it and bein' it, that's two different things. I mean, it's real hard to be free when you are bought and sold in the marketplace. Of course, don't ever tell anybody that they're not free, 'cause then they're gonna get real busy killin' and maimin' to prove to you that they are. Oh, yeah, they're gonna talk to you, and talk to you, and talk to you about individual freedom. But they see a free individual, it's gonna scare 'em. Billy: Well, it don't make 'em runnin' scared. George Hanson: No, it makes 'em dangerous.
