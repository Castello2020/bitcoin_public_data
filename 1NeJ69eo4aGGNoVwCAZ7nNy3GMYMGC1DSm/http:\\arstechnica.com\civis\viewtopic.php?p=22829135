Just got back from a short trip to Florida. When we were there it was tough to tell if the mixing valve on the kitchen tap was malfunctioning, or if the "cold water" was just poorly named.Returned home to upstate NY yesterday, and this morning I was so struck by the difference that I grabbed a kitchen thermometer. My cold tap water is running around 52f. I have a cheap infrared meter that I'll try later today to see if it agrees, but my hands tell me that it is at least close.So:Your cold water tap. Is it just plain labeled wrong, or does it deliver?Actual reading welcome as are other general comments regarding water quality. When we vacation we use store bought water for drinking and coffee, but tap water for ice and cooking. At home our tap water is municipal, but good to drink; it comes from a local lake not from hundreds of miles away.Yesterday in the airport my wife bought a bottle of water (in Florida) that claimed to be NYC water. It is fair to say that the water in Manhatten is good; but as far as I know it comes a fair distance to get there, mostly from the Adirondacks.

Depends on the season; during winter it actually is cold, during summer it's cool. Never had the misfortune of actually having warm water come out of the cold water tap.

Our tap water seems to be about room temperature most of the year.

Cold water supply temperature is roughly going to be your annual mean air temperature plus/minus a few degrees for seasonality and how deep your water lines run.

Turning on either tap here results in hot water. The "cold" tap eventually produces water in the mid-70s, but it takes 30-40 seconds to do so.

Mine is cold. I'm in the mountains and its well water. Sometimes in the winter the water is too cold to brush your teeth.I have to mix hot and cold for about 5 months of the year.

Well water here: Usually on the cool end year round.Manhattan water is indeed very tasty. It's the only large city I've been in that I've actually liked it straight from the tap. As an aside: Philly water is truly disgusting.

In the winter the water is actually cold, but in summer, any water that's in the pipes in the house gets heated to ridiculous levels; you have to let it run until you get to water that has been sitting underground before you get anything even resembling lukewarm. Even then, it's not going to be cold by any stretch; if you want actual cold water, you need a refrigerator or water cooler. Which is fine, because the water tastes like ass, so you won't be drinking it anyway.

You know, I always have preferred the taste of bottled water to tap water. Though, the worst potable water I've had was well water in Arkansas. Brushing your teeth with water that tastes and smells of rotten eggs is not a pleasant experience.

This is a huge issue for clothes washing. I don't care what P&G says: nothings coming out at 45°F.Also, raise your hand if you know your water hardness. You should!

We are on a well that pulls water from 120 feet down. Once it gets through the filters and the metal pipes, it is cold, cold, cold. And delicious.

I'm on Indianapolis municipal water, and it's cool in the summer (and will get colder if you let it run) and can be downright frigid in the winter.I actually kind of like being on city water. It tastes fine*, so it saves me $$ because I can just fill up gallon jugs straight from the tap and put them in the fridge to get cold. No need to buy a filter or buy bottled water or anything.* - We do have a couple of weeks every year (usually either early in the summer or late in the summer) when the water tastes like catfish piss. I'm told that it's due to low water levels in the reservoir(s).

"Cold water" doesn't mean "won't do shit in warm or hot water," which is what I thought for a while.

I rented a shack for a few years ("house" or even "cottage" would be too generous, but the price was right ) where the pipes feeding the kitchen sink ran on the outside of the wall, on the wall facing due west. In the afternoons the first 30 seconds of water out of the cold tap would be blazing hot, even dangerously so.Around here in "Climate Best by Government Test" the climate's pretty temperate, and the water out of the tap is accordingly cool but not cold.

I live in MS so tap water is about 75F in the summer, closer to 40F in the winter.When I worked in NV, all non potable water was pumped from the open pit, so was 167F when pumping started, about 130F in our buildings. When you flushed it got very warm suddenly.

Once you get the hot water out of the lines there's a difference between hot and cold. Until then, there isn't much of a difference though. Cold runs around 70 and I think the hot water heater is set to 120 or there abouts. In our guest house/rec room, you have to let the water run for ~15 seconds before you can even consider to use it on either setting as all the piping is run along the rafters and down a west wall. Eventually, you'll get cool water once it starts drawing fresh water from the well, but the well is only 35-40 feet down so it isn't *that* cool. If you need to cool off, that's what the swimming pool is for. (Once you've checked it for gators and cotton mouths first) AmigaPhreak

It ranges from cool to room temp.Depending on the season and how long I let it run.The water at my GF's house is ice cold for most of the year. It's awesome for drinking, but makes you use alot of hot water to take a shower.

Ours averages around 45. It can get a little warmer/colder depending on the season, and at work the upstairs lines are always warmer than the downstairs, which, I guess, makes sense.

In the winter it can get pretty cold but nothing like freezing. Summer, it is less cold but not what I call warm. Once it has run enough to be pulling water from outside the house tubes it is cold enough to be refreshing.For hot water, I keep it hot enough to call it hot but not hot enough to scald. I can shower with it full on hot if I want, I generally don't though except in winter when I feel like blasting out some steam.
