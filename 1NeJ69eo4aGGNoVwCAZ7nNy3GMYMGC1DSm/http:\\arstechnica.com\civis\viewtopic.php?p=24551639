Personally, if I got struck by lightning I'd be getting a full heart workup at the hospital. You also probably want to be installing some lightning rods on your house.

Resistivity of hard rubber: 10^13 ohm-metersResistivity of air: More than 10^16 ohm-metersIn short, rubber will do even worse than air at protecting you from extremely high voltages. If something can arc through air it can certainly go through rubber like no one's business.The best form of protection against lightning is to have an alternate path for the current to travel in. This is how a lightning rod works- since it is higher up, the current travels through less air and follows a path of less resistance. Think of it as a parallel circuit- most of the current will travel through the path of least resistance.

Re. shoes, I don't think the belief is that wearing shoes would make you immune to a lightning strike, but rather that lightning will prefer a path of lower resistance and so wearing shoes may make the path through your body marginally less desirable than another nearby path through inanimate objects.

I've been struck twice. First time hurt like hell. Second time I didn't even know what the hell happened until people picked me up off the ground and I woke up.

This might sound weird, but would it be possible for you to post a pic of where you were struck? I hear that lightning strikes leave awesome looking scars and I'm curious to see what it looks like.[ edit: I'm not sure why all the downvotes, this was a legitimate question. I appologize if I offended anyone. I have included a link about what I was referencing as far as the lightning scars go. they scars are quite interesting http://www.electricyouniverse.com/eye/t ... igures.jpg ]

Sobels wrote:Resistivity of hard rubber: 10^13 ohm-metersResistivity of air: More than 10^16 ohm-metersSo that inch of rubber in your shoes is a more desirable than the equal volume of air right next to it.

Metallica is more sue happy, didn't want to bring grief to the site, and putting Jason's head on Eddie seemed funnier, plus that conversation I posted above is where the Iron Maiden reference came from.

Quote:I hit the concrete floor and bounced back up to my feet, which were shuffling at top speed into a bookshelf. I remember thinking, "OK, going to die now. Do not fall down. Do not pass out."This is like... blacked-out kind of thinking. I'm not sure how else to describe it. Like if you stretch, really stretch, before your body is ready for it and your head goes numb for a few seconds. I remember back when I was in college this super high pressure front came through my neighborhood. Tornado in Maryland, 2001 I think? The air was all kinds of strange, and I got up and stretched, and my head did the 'going numb for a few seconds' thing. But I guess the air pressure combined with that sent me for a loop, and I collapsed. But I remember thinking "hey, I'm trying to sit back down in the chair but instead I'm sort of staggering forward and now I'm on the floor what just happened?"It was a really strange feeling. I can't compare it to being struck by lightning - never had that happen, thankfully - but it made me remember that sensation of... movement without direct control, I guess? Anyways, just sharing. Glad you're alright - but seriously, have a doctor check you out, mkay?

I remember seeing a documentary on lightning featuring a park ranger who'd been struck six times, at least some of which were while seated inside his vehicle...So, after you've seen the doctor, are you going to have someone suitably qualified come and install lightning conductors on your office?Edit: spelling (all thmbs tody?)
