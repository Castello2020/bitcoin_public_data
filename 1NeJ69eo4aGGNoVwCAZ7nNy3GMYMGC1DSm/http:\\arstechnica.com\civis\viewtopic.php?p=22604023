But yeah, using real cards tends to follow that.  <br /><br />Having 4 out of 5 cards be proxies is, to me, wrong on a bunch of different levels.  The usual reasons for using a proxy are as a placeholder for a card you're going to acquire, as a replacement for a card that is extremely difficult to get (cost/availability), or to replace a high dollar card you actually have but you don't want damaged through play.  When 80% of your cards are fakes its none of those reasons; at that point you're basically just stealing.</div><br /><br /><img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:" title="Rolleyes" /> <br /><br />A proxy has no value. Proxy's do not offer the same utility that real cards do: You can't trade them, sell them, or use them in sanctioned tournaments. That's what you are paying for when you buy the card. The value of a card that could only be played in casual formats and cannot be traded or sold is going to be nothing. <br /><br />Making foil proxies and selling them or trading them for real cards or $$ (like a lot of eBay sellers do), I think that's a big no no. But I'm not going to get bent out of shape over playing the cube me and my players want to play without spending $5000 on cards when the games are not sanctioned tournaments and we would get absolutely zero benefit to spending that $$.<br /><br />I accept that one fact of playing Low Cost Magic is that I basically cannot ever play in any sanctioned tournament ever outside of limited, due to the cost of deck construction being far to high be considered Low Cost Magic.

              In my mind, there's a scale.  On the left side, it reads &quot;Not cool, dude.&quot;  On the right, &quot;Cool.&quot;<br /><br />  Now zoom in a bit towards the middle.  See that there, a bit left of the center?  &quot;Emkorial's cube is 80% proxies,&quot; right there.<br /><br />  Zoom out, pan left a couple of inches.  Ah, there we go.  &quot;Wrong enough that I give a damn.&quot;  Just checking.<br /><br />  Somewhere further to the left you'll find &quot;That's, like, stealing, man...&quot; but you probably get the point.<br /><br />...<br /><br />  Odd as I may feel defending someone who has been on my ignore list for quite some time and likely will remain there, there you have it.

              Gonna come down on Em's side here.<br /><br />I've got nothing against using proxies to construct a Cube, especially if the Cube is still being tested.  Why splash out several hundred bucks when you're going to be replacing things?  <br /><br />To get a bit more controversial, the original developers (Wizards) aren't getting any money for your fifth-hand purchases of 12 year old cards from retailers. As abrasive as Em can be, he certainly buys products from Wizards.  Do you really owe RandomCardStore.com anything?  I'm all for supporting my LGS but they're unlikely to have the all pieces for a Cube, even if they're well stocked.  LGSes stock modern cards that are going to be used in competitive decks.<br /><br />Cubes are a communal game experience made up of people who already buy and play plenty of Magic.  One of my favorite parts of the spirit of Cubes is how free-form it is.  I've seen hardcore cubes that have $5000 in cards in them, but I've also played great Cubes that were proxied or contained reproductions or altered cards.  You aren't building a Cube for personal gain, unlike normal Magic.  <br /><br />My two cubes are made of real cards. However, if I wanted to make a sillier one or one constructed from older cards, I could definitely see making a proxy one.  I've also been tempted to start creating cards to fit holes in Cubes.

              I realize this is off-topic, but I've discovered a low cost way to play Apples to Apples. Just find the list of cards from the official game, and print them out at kinkos to play at home.<br /><br />Also, if you give them your copy of Apples to Apples that you paid money for a year ago to pay for the printing, it means you're actually playing for free!<br /><br />(I also figured out a really low cost way to watch DVDs)

But yeah, using real cards tends to follow that.  <br /><br />Having 4 out of 5 cards be proxies is, to me, wrong on a bunch of different levels.  The usual reasons for using a proxy are as a placeholder for a card you're going to acquire, as a replacement for a card that is extremely difficult to get (cost/availability), or to replace a high dollar card you actually have but you don't want damaged through play.  When 80% of your cards are fakes its none of those reasons; at that point you're basically just stealing.</div><br /><br /><img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:" title="Rolleyes" /> <br /><br />A proxy has no value. Proxy's do not offer the same utility that real cards do: You can't trade them, sell them, or use them in sanctioned tournaments. That's what you are paying for when you buy the card. The value of a card that could only be played in casual formats and cannot be traded or sold is going to be nothing. <br /><br />Making foil proxies and selling them or trading them for real cards or $$ (like a lot of eBay sellers do), I think that's a big no no. But I'm not going to get bent out of shape over playing the cube me and my players want to play without spending $5000 on cards when the games are not sanctioned tournaments and we would get absolutely zero benefit to spending that $$.<br /><br />I accept that one fact of playing Low Cost Magic is that I basically cannot ever play in any sanctioned tournament ever outside of limited, due to the cost of deck construction being far to high be considered Low Cost Magic.</div><br /><br />How is this any different from illegally downloading a videogame? I mean, you're only playing it, it's not like you're using it to enter into any tournaments or reselling it, so it's a victimless crime! I might be mistaken but I think that argument has been shot down by most respectable people...

              80% is a bit high, but this is very much a case of abandon ware. Emkorial can literally not buy from the manufacturer that which he is proxying. It's not like he's proxying Innistrad cards. He is proxying cards that have been out of production and only available on the secondary market by mail order for not inconsiderable expense.<br /><br />Don't hate. Don't create bad metaphors. This is closer to ScummVM than hacked xbox360.

              Soâ€¦ like I said, wrong on several levels:<br /><br />-	As pointed out, heâ€™s using the same argument that pirates use to justify what they do in that heâ€™s not making money off of it or reselling it so heyâ€¦ who does it hurt?  Iâ€™ll tell you who it hurts, everyone who plays the game.  The secondary market is an important part of the economic system of the game.  A key part of any â€˜collectableâ€™ game is the retention of value on the product.  If everything was available at the same rate as commons nothing would be worth anything.  If cards never went out of print or were lost or destroyed than cards wouldnâ€™t be worth much.  If no one buys cards on the secondary market and instead just goes down to Kinkoâ€™s and plays off proxies than that market tanks than that market dies and no one can reliably sell and buy cards, demand goes down, card values suffer.  <br /><br />-	No one builds a cube that isnâ€™t a fan of the game, itâ€™s not a â€˜new guyâ€™ thing.  Yet heâ€™s willing to hurt the value of other players collections, hurt the secondary market that helps sustains the game, and by extension the company that makes the game.  I canâ€™t say Iâ€™m surprised given his history of posting about Magic.  He shows up in every single thread to bemoan how &lt;LATEST SET HERE&gt; is the worst set theyâ€™ve ever printed and &lt;NEW STRATEGY HERE&gt; is completely dumb and only idiots play the game.  Yet he is always there and apparently always still playing. <br /><br />-	He, if memory serves, essentially â€˜chargesâ€™ people a pack to play with his fake cube for prizes.  So his argument that heâ€™s not using them for anything but casual person play falls apart there.<br /><br />-	It is, impact to the game or economics aside, just an all around scummy thing to do.  Again, I understand that the occasional proxy is necessary and part of the game.  Proxying a deck for testing purposes is fine, using a proxy for the reasons I listed before is no big deal, but having 80% of your 400 card cube be fake is none of that.  His recent crowing about â€˜low cost Magicâ€™ makes it even worse since, as rafadavic pointed out, nearly any hobby is cheap if you counterfeit everything.  I can â€˜low cost video gameâ€™ with the help of the Pirate Bay all day long.<br /><br />-	For a guy who decries Spikes and tournament play at every corner his justification that he wonâ€™t spend money on a cube because heâ€™s not going to get a financial return on it is laughable.  With that same logic essentially only players on the competitive circuit should ever actually buy cards because theyâ€™re the only ones that stand to see a return on that investment through winning.<br /><br />He can do anything he wants, but letâ€™s not pretend this is anything other than it is.

Rather everyone that plays put packs into the pot so that the winners gets something.<br /><br />Just like playing a $5 nickel poker game, he isn't charging unless he is taking a share as &quot;the house&quot; from the entry fee or each pot. And I'm pretty sure he isn't doing that. <br /><br />For example, you have 8 people and everyone puts in a pack cause that is the &quot;charge&quot; to play. If you then payout 4 packs to the winner, 2 packs to second place and 1 pack to third and fourth place you aren't netting anything as the house. If he happens to net positive packs over time I think it is because he is winning (which granted the odds are going to be slightly higher as the designer of the cube since you know every card that is and isn't in the pool) more than the average person, not because he is charging people to play...

              It's fun to say.<br /><br />Also, it's relatively strong and very old without having anything that really duplicates anything else.<br /><br />Tolarian Academy wouldn't be a terrible one either.  I know they try to somewhat limit the dollar value of these things though so I didn't want to go too crazy.  Isle of Wak-Wak is like 30-40, Wasteland is whatever it's currently at (ie a lot), Maze is 25-30.  Hell, foil Reliquary Towers are like 10.

All the players (including me) put in a pack and then we all play for them. I receive no special treatment, vig, or benefit from those packs.

I wouldn't. If I didn't proxy the cube, the cube would not exist. I would not spend any $$ on getting real copies. There is no &quot;money lost&quot; because no money would have been spent. <br /><br />As for &quot;hurting the game&quot;, people quitting hurts the game.

If your choices are proxying or not playing at all, I don't see the harm in proxying. You want to proxy all 100 cards in your ED deck, go right ahead. <br /><br />And like I said, the cards have a collectible value (hence CCG), and proxies do not effect that collectible value at all.

There is (by design) a lot of balance among the colors, so I can't go &quot;Man, I know I totally tricked out white, so I'm drafting that every single time&quot;, not to mention the huge amount of variance in card distribution when we create the packs to draft.

The casual market drives MUCH more of the value of MANY more of the cards than the small slice that is currently standard legal.  And you're right back to the 'well I wasn't going to buy it so it's okay to steal it' ideology. <br /><br />You can justify it however you want to yourself, but it's blatantly obvious that in the end you want the cards and just aren't willing to pay for them but also aren't mature enough to say 'Well I can't afford this so I'm not doing it'.

Real cards have at some point rendered revenue to WotC, paying them for their investment in producing a quality product. By proxying the vast majority of your cube, you're deriving value from WotC's IP, for which they charge, without anyone ever having paid for use of it. Your stance that the possession of a particular card having no utility is pretty self-defeating. If you didn't find value in having them in your cube, you wouldn't proxy the cards.

Sorry to dispel your simplistic notion of my MTG preferences. <br /><br />(I also immensly enjoyed the 6 sets before that, which puts the count of sets I liked to 15 of the last 20. Yeah, I'm such a hater)<br /><br />SOM sucks. MBS sucks. ISD sucks. DKA sucks. It just so happens that the standard environment right now is made up of sets I consider the worst ever to see print. That doesn't mean I'm a super pessimistic guy who hates MTG. It means I hate shitastic sets. And they just happen to be on a string of shitastic sets right now. They're entire philosophy behind ISD block seems to be &quot;we don't care if the card sucks and is overcosted, if it fits a horror cliche, it's in&quot;. When you put &quot;top down design&quot; over &quot;playable cards&quot;, you get shitty sets. Apparently they didn't learn their lesson from Kamigawa block, where they did the same thing, put design over fun, playable cards. <br /><br />I'm not an MTG apologizer. I love the game, and play quite a bit, but I'm not going to pretend a shitty set isn't shitty.
