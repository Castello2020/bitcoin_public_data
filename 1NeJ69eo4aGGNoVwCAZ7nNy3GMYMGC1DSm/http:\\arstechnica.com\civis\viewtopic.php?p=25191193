Quote:Ocean acidification is a decrease in the pH and carbonate concentration of ocean water caused by CO2 pumped into the atmosphere. Or reduced sentiment circulation in the oceans. Or reduction of river run-off caused by dams, aquifer depletion, farming, etc. Or as many as 4 other plausible explanations that do not involve CO2.But that would not fit into the favored agenda of blaming the energy industry.

If there is a reduction in vapor nucleation, does it follow there is going to typically be more vapor available for lower populations of nuceation agents. What kind of effect does this have on a typical cloud? Does this move it towards larger drops more quickly?Does this extend the lifespan of a cloud or does it cause water to precipitate more quickly? (or both depending on other conditions) In turn changing weather patterns? When vapor condenses, its losing energy, so does this concentrate energy into fewer more violent weather?So many thoughts, cool article.

Color me cynical, but does it matter at this point? Money is what rules this world. So long as combating climate change is seen anti-business nothing substantive will be done about it.

If you looks at the earth just like you look at your body it is easy to figure out everything you do to it has an effect and that effects on one part of it sometimes if not always affects other parts in ways that are not always easy to spot/predict. With the planet it just happens in a scale orders of magnitude more complex making it harder to comprehend.

Colour me cynical, but it really doesn't sound like these studies are anywhere near comprehensive or conclusive enough to draw much in the way of conclusions from. They are interesting, yes, and probably provide useful data, but to jump to the conclusion that ocean acidification adds to or multiplies global warming is very speculative, at best, right now. The article clearly tries to point in that direction, even if it doesn't state it outright, and a lot of people are going to jump to that conclusion.

In short, I don't know if there actually is a definition in science for being 100% certain on something. Not even Laws.A law is a definition of an observed phenomena. In physics, this is usually a mathematical equation that models some observed behaviour. These don't provide an explanation for why something works the way it does.A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for the way a law or collection of laws work. These will usually have predicitons that are not covered by the knowledge of the thing the hypothesis is for. Experiments are run and checked against the hypothesis, and the hypothesis is peer reviewed. If the hypothesis passes all of this, it becomes a theory.A theory is an explanation of how something works that is accurate to the best of our knowlege. A theory can be incomplete, or only valid within certain parameters. That does not necessarily mean that the theory is wrong, just that we don't have the entire picture yet.The Gallilean and Newtonian Laws of motion describe how objects move when forces are applied and how they orbit each other. These form the classical mechanics theory. Classical mechanics is enough to determine accurately when solar and lunar eclipses occur and the movement of the planets (so determine the trajectory for the Voyager and Cassini probes we have sent to the outer planets).What Classical Mechanics cannot calculate is the orbit of Mercury. This is because it is close enough to the sun that its orbit is being changed by the space-time curvature of the sun. Here you need the theories of Special Relativity and General Relativity. These predicted black holes before their discovery, the curvature of light around a planet, and more that have been proven time and again. Also, at non-relativistic speeds, Special Relativity simplifies to the classical mechanics formulation.The Quantum Mechanics theory has been proven time and again through experiments.NOTE: Although String Theory has the word "Theory" in it, it is actually a hypothesis as there hasn't yet been significant evidence to prove or disprove it.

I take "show" and "demonstrate" as meaning that evidence has been provided that supports the hypothesis. "Prove" on the other hand requires a higher standard.I don't agree with the claim that science can not prove anything. Some things can be proven, some cannot. For example, it's difficult at best to "prove" a species is extinct. You just provide enough strong evidence that it's a usable working assumption. However, it's not nearly so hard to prove a species is not extinct.

I personally doubt any of the efforts we put forth would make a real change to counter act the negative effects of climate change. Efforts such as these should have started 50 or more years ago imho.

Interesting article. I'm sure the comment section will, again, be very entertaining. The level which science has reached in adding variables to climate modeling boggles my poor brain. So less sulfur yields less nucleation. That could yield higher water vapor concentrations in the atmosphere. Isn't water vapor a greenhouse gas?

Suppose the C02 linkage survives sufficient scrutiny. It may generate the business need for companies to develop and market processes for adding CO2 to acidified ocean water rather than undergroud sequestration as a restorative measure. Just like strip-mining drove the business need for companies specialing in the remediation of that land after their ore output dropped below a cost-effective level. Who pays for the remediation is negotiable... the companies fulfilling the work contracts employed people and made money.Say what you want about whether that's how society should operate (exploit first, fix later), but it is a model that occurs with money-making acting as an integral force.

An alternative conclusion would have been that it does not appear to make enough of a difference and could safely be ignored...

Well, another reinforcing feedback loop, and one that was suspected for a long time.Anyhow, while there is a vanishing probality that climate models are false and there is no warming, the costs of doing nothing are so huge that not acting now (or rather 10 years ago) is beyond stupid.We are facing an increasing risk of passing a threshold we wont be able to recover from, and so far we reached the intermediate steps much faster than even the most pessimistics projections said.

A complex enough situation that you really need to model it explicitly.

where did this definition of 'acidification' come from? it was beat into my head in junior high that nothing is an acidic until its pH is <7. if an alkaline substance drops in pH it is still a base until it hits 7, at which point it would be 'neutral'. i guess saying that there are areas where sea water is 'less alkaline/less basic' isnt as scary sounding as saying that the ocean is 'acidifying?' Even 'ocean neutralization' would make more sense...

A solid proof using such an approximation shows that the result holds regardless of what value the error term takes within its allowed range. Similar practices apply to many others sorts of approximations as well - show that the error introduced is small (by some particular definition), and then show that any error below that magnitude makes no qualitative difference. Experimental conditions have nothing to do with it.

The former's chemistry allows the formation of sulfuric acid, the latter's does not. The article here is about flows of the latter. Not all sulfur compounds are equivalent. Quit being obtuse.

The level which science has reached in adding variables to climate modeling boggles my poor brain. So less sulfur yields less nucleation. That could yield higher water vapor concentrations in the atmosphere. Isn't water vapor a greenhouse gas?Yes. http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/featur ... rming.htmlWater vapor may be a greenhouse gas, a cloud is NOT water vapor. A cloud is condensed water(vapor). So the less Sulfur in the atmosphere the less water vapor is condensed into clouds.Quite simple you know...http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudent ... ds-k4.htmlYes and if there is less nucleation yields less clouds therefore more water vapor....

I am simply reminding everyone that science can not prove anything; it can only disprove hypotheses.So how do we know that hydrogen and oxygen exist and they commonly combine to form water? Has it been proven that this doesn't occur?

Even 'ocean neutralization' would make more sense...Its a directional term. If your pH is decreasing, you are acidifying. The term 'neutralization' would imply that the change would reverse direction below pH 7, which it would not. It has nothing to do with sounding scary.

Assuming that further research points to the conclusions of this paper being correct, is this something that would be relatively simple to counteract by deliberately releasing an appropriate amount of the appropriate sulfer compounds?(And yes, I know that counteracting a problem is not the same as solving it or removing the cause(s) of the problem. But since climate change is a long-term issue and we can't go back in time to undo what we believe to be the causes, counteraction and mitigation would still seem to be worthwhile topics.)

It's a perfectly appropriate word to describe the process of becoming more acidic; it does not require nor imply crossing the threshold of pH < 7. In fact, it's more accurate than "neutralization," because "neutralization" would imply a directed process that stopped once pH reached 7.00, which is clearly nonsensical in this context.
