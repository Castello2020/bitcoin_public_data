Planets are about 1.5 times Earth's radius—and the right distance from a host star.Read the whole story

Oh hey, what's up LV-223 and LV-426!In all seriousness, the atmosphere is the big question here, correct? These bodies could be dead planetoids like the moon with no atmosphere to sustain life, regardless of their place in the hospitable zone. We can't really tell if that's the case yet, as the article states.

So, if/when we get around to colonizing places like this in the semi-distant future, seeing as all infrastructure would be from scratch, what are the odds the colonists lose most or all of the tech within a few generations?

This article seems to be missing a lot of valuable information... that or I'm just really oblivious right now.After reading the article, I don't know:- How far away this star is in lightyears.- Who these scientists are, other than being associated with the Kepler mission in some way.- How statistical inference can be nearly good enough.- - We can't even confirm the planets' existence using normal methods, from what I gathered in the article, they have to be inferred from the lack of other effects... yet somehow we're determining the number of planets, their individual radii, their orbital radii, and more.

The reasons it could happen (imo) would be if we were to establish a colony either without ftl travel or simply to far away for trade to be viable. That in combination with the population being low enough for that to happen (< 10000).Add then that it's likely a decent ammount of resources will have to be spent terraforming before the fact. I'd think the most likely cause for such a colony would be religious fundamentalists wanting to get away from terra.Pysgard wrote:Alanthiras wrote:Wouldn't that be like double gravity? :xI'm quite fine here on lovely Terra thank you!

It's interesting to note, Ars Technica, that I went to downvote a spam post and I got a popup saying "parse error". Of course, when I refreshed the page, the post was gone. Not sure if you want me seeing "parse error" in those instances. Perhaps something like "We deleted spam comment." I'm sure my request to downvote includes some kind of ID, and you could store the IDs of the delete spam items in a table and do a check against that table if the ID I send isn't found or is marked "deleted". Blah blah.

I'm not going to do the math just now, but gravity on the surface of a planet is inversely related to the distance squared to the core.In other words, while the gravitational strength of the planet grows exponentially to its radius, what you feel decreases by the same rate relative to the radius. I believe you could have a planet with twice the radius and yet have Earth-like surface gravity, as long as the density is similar.

And as you said, since mass is proportionate to r^3, and gravity is inversely proportionate to R^2 (R being object's distance from the center of mass), at the planet's surface gravity would be 1.61gs.edit: first part of my post was chopped, and then I realized that much of my post was redundant..

However, its probably pretty safe to assume it is more dense due to its larger gravity. Short answer: not possible to tell.

It would be quite amazing if both of those planets in the habitable zone had liquid water and life. Can you imagine if Mars was that easily colonized? Our definition of life is so narrow. Being able to study life from another planet -- even within our own solar system -- would provide incredible insight. Being able to study life from 2 planets within another solar system would be even more incredible.

Oops, yep 4.17 x Earth mass. Had an extra 4/3pi there. so 2.61 G? Gah,. nope. 1.61 gravity.

I would not want us to be much farther from the sun.Just at the warm edge, in fact. I don't know the details of their modeling, but I can think of some possible explanations.Note that while we've had ice ages, we don't appear to have actually had a global freeze, and it looks like CO2 buildup can do a lot to prevent such an event. And we have had periods without icecaps, at which times the planet had relatively little margin for tolerating further heating before the planet would turn into a steambath with runaway greenhouse effect due to water vapor.Also recall that the planet had to stay cool enough for life to form and thrive even before it had its current oxy-nitrogen atmosphere. The inner edge may be the distance a young planet with a dense atmosphere rich in greenhouse gases requires in order to keep liquid water.

Did anyone read the linked article? they're saying they think both of these planets are completely covered with water, with no visble land at all - waterworlds - and maybe not even much of an atmosphere. seems to be an awful lot of conjecture just based on a few transits...

On further review this was via transit detection (duh, it's Kepler), but all they know right now is the radius of the planets in-system. Everything else is speculation and computer modeling.

Mars is further away from the Sun; surface radiation would be about the same as astronauts in orbit (i.e. manageable at early colony stages, and easily manageable when permanent underground settlements are built).

Earth, of course, is at 1.0 AU. The outer boundary depends on your definition and estimates range from 1.15 AU to 1.4 AU.Recent research (http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/new ... table-zone) shows the inner edge may be even closer, at 0.99 AU. That would mean if we were 1% closer to the Sun, Earth would not be habitable.

Someone might buy a piece of land in some very remote place and build a rocket connected to a big solar farm that collects solar energy during the day and then uses the stored energy to fire the rocket straight up into the sky all night long.
