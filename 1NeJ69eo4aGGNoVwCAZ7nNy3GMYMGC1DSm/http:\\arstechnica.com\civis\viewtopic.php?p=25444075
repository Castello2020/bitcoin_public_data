Is there some extreme gender disparity going on here? I can't see how the females could be promiscuous with males that only mate once unless males greatly outnumber females.

I was very confused by the end of this article. I kept waiting for the author to explain how this reproduction causes the death of male involved. Then I realized that the quoted term "suicidal reproduction" is just a misnomer for the process described at the end of the articleQuote:The huge amount of resources expended on mating, combined with the fact that survival in small mammals is pretty low to begin with, means that the males are unlikely to survive to mate a second time anyway. So instead, they simply tune their bodies to make the most out of the one chance they get. And at an average of 9.4 hours, it's hard to say that they don't accomplish this.I guess even biologists sometimes dabble in click-baiting.

So it might be that females don't actually mate all that much in total.

I wonder if given a few million more years of the same evolutionary pressures, some marsupials would evolve similar nigh-parasitic extreme sexual dimorphism to some species of Anglerfish, where the male mates to a female, latches on, and then atrophies to little more than a permanently attached set of gonads.

Two people mentioned that it doesn't explain why they die. I guess those two people didn't read the article closely enough. "The marsupials that engage in this "one strike and you're out" approach to mating all die off because of a general immune failure that happens shortly after mating."

I need to get a little marsupial costume for Halloween that says "That's right ladies, 9 hours." Maybe with a sleazy marsupial combover and shirt unbuttoned down to my waist.Actually, that would probably work best as a T-shirt.

Clearly this is not evidence for evolution, but instead evidence for the only competing theory! That theory is Perverted Design. Only a Designer obsessed with sex and violence and gluttony and all those other vices would create these Irreducibly Perverse systems we see in nature, as exemplified by these marsupials. I keep trying to have my local school board acknowledge this theory and teach it to the students, but they unfairly discriminate against my viewpoint! fferitt25 wrote:FoxHound wrote:I was very confused by the end of this article.

The males die off and that clears the way for the offspring to eat as many insects as they can while they're available, without their fathers competing for those nutrients once the bugs start disappearing.

Even if they could prove that the one thing causes the other, it's an unintended consequence of their own physiology.

Even if they could prove that the one thing causes the other, it's an unintended consequence of their own physiology.I have to agree with this. The wording suggests that it's individual reproductive behavior that is suicidal, while the details show that this isn't the case. It seems like the males will still die even if they don't mate. When I think of suicidal reproduction, I think of a spider or praying mantis being eaten by its mate.From the article:". . .there are mammals out there that engage in what researchers are terming "suicidal reproduction." The problem is that the behavior. . ."It also isn't obvious that death from immune failure is related to building up a store of sperm and then shutting off gonads, though I can see how that is plausible.In general it seems like the article would be better with a little more detail. I was surprised to see that the animals were only referred to as marsupials, with no species or common names mentioned (though I tend to skip over those anyway). Where they live wasn't mentioned either (from the paper: Australia, South America, and Papua New Guinea).Actually this first sentence from the paper helps explain things a little better:"In some marsupial genera but in no other mammals, escalating stress hormones during the breeding season cause immune system collapse and synchronized death after mating in all males (suicidal reproduction)."Personally I think this is a case where the "how" is more interesting than the "why".For example, I wonder if the escalating stress hormones are due to interacting with other individuals during the mating season. Would the males still die at the same time if they were raised alone in captivity?

"What sort of evolutionary advantage could this provide?"One thing that occurs to me is that it means that adult males aren't consuming resources that could otherwise go to the young.

Bradley (1997) proposed that these rapid changes are equivalent to accelerated ageing."What a harsh way to go!
