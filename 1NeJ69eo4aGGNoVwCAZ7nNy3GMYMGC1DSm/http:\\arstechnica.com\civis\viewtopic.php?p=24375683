And, I have a lot of Korean friends (hence why I know how bat shit crazy all of you are) and this is a common sticking point when conversations of beauty come up. I think they are damn fine (fine, as in okay, not dammmmnnn girl you fine!) as is. But their culture prizes wide eyes. To me, seeing someone with very obvious plastic surgery is a turn off, I like au natural, and really dig chicks that don't wear a lot of makeup. Yes, we have argued about this at length, drunkenly, while eating with chop sticks. Things get thrown...And its fucking easy to tell different Asian people apart. They don't look alike at all.

Maybe I'm not very good at facial recognition, but sometimes I have difficulty telling Asian people apart.And having visited Japan numerous times I can say that there are probably a dozen or so distinct facial types that most people belong to. At least in Tokyo.

I don't think I've ever been "confused" by people of the same race, regardless of their race, or my familiarity with it. A college friend's GF used to say she had trouble telling black people apart, (regardless of how dissimilar they looked). It boggled.
