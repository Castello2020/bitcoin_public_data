Onions are excellent. I love them raw, sliced thin on sandwiches or in salads, caramelized, on tacos, in French onion soup, pretty much everywhere.For a long time I thought I disliked onion rings. Then I had incredible onion rings at a pub one night and realized that I loved excellent onion rings, I'd just been receiving crap onion rings up until that point.

Yay for the onion haters! That leaves more for me!!Now we know why sweetpepper isn't called sweetonion. There's a middle-eastern dish called... mujadara that is rice, lentils and caramelized onions. It is one of my favorite comfort foods. Easy to make, good for you, and full of tasty onion.If you have a spare 8 hours, caramelizing onions in a crock pot is ideal. Toss them in, with a dab of butter or olive oil and a tablespoon or so of water set crock pot to low, cover and walk away. Stir them every hour or so. Perfect onions for french onion soup.

I've given up on ordering xxx-salads because I'm sick of finding onions in it.

I do not like the taste of onions. Generally, the closer they are to raw and solitary, the less I like them in my food. I like them fine in salsa, or ok caramelized in a dish, and just barely in onion rings, but added as a separate item they are a no-go. Burgers, sandwiches, pizza, chili dogs. I will order them without. If I get them, I may remove them, depending on how difficult it is or how much is on there.

Aromatics are a wonderful thing, onions included. In fact I don't think I've had an onion I don't like. Rare is the dish I make that doesn't have onions involved. Tomato sauce for pasta, or pizza? Onions. Chili? Onions, Tacos/Fajitas? Onions. Steak? Onions. Burgers? Onions. Crock Pot Pulled Pork? Barbeque Sauce and Onions. Roast Chicken? Onions.Short of cereal I'm not sure what I make that doesn't have onions in it. Hell even my home fries and omelettes have onions in them.

I was always an onion fiend, I'd put them on metaphorically everything. I still do, but things have taken a disturbing turn. I have no problem with the onion breath but lately onions seems to be causing ... a fire down below for lack of a better term. I feel like my body has betrayed me. Damn 40's.Quick tip: for faster browning of sauteed onions, toss a 1/4-cup or so of water into the pan when you start. It speeds up the onions giving up their own juices so it all can boil off and let the Maillard reaction start.By the way...Hound of Cullen wrote:There's a middle-eastern dish called... mujadara that is rice, lentils and caramelized onions.

If onions were a girl, I might consider marrying them.That's how much I love onions.Pickled, sauteed, grilled, fried, or raw. Yum.Also, red, yellow, or white...yum. The white ones get kind of bitey sometimes. I like red the best, probably.And wiki tells me that the Chinese eat 6 times as many onions as the US does. This surprises me, because when I think of onions, I think of soffrito, mirepoix, or "the trinity". Not chinese food.

You onion haters will never know the awesomeness of a plate of fresh Pierogi done the proper way: gently boiled in mildly salted water, then slathered in butter and onions (where the onions are gently sauteed in the butter until they are *just* translucent). OMG, NOM.

I like the taste of onions, but dislike the texture.So minced onions in food never draws a complaint from me but 1/4 of an onion of a burger? EWWW. I often order food with onions, then take them off. It leaves a gentle taste with no texture.If (as in your poll) I am only allowed WITH onions or WITHOUT, I have to vote without. Too bad, as I like the taste of onions.

I know it's heresy and a rejection of a core flavor and texture agent in the world of cooking...but no, usually I don't care for onions.The flavor is fine--I like roasts that are cooked with onions, I don't mind if onion powder is used. It's the texture that I can't stand. It's that way with most foods that I don't like.In some contexts, I'll put up with them. A very small amount of grilled onions on a burger is fine, although if I have the ability to customize a burger I'll ask for it without. Same for meatloaf--onions aren't a deal-breaker as long as they're not huge chunks, but given my druthers I'd just as soon avoid them (my mom has made her signature meatloaf with onion powder instead of onions for three decades now because I'm her favorite, much to my father's disappointment--he loves onions).And I like onion rings, of course. Everyone likes onion rings.But yeah, generally speaking I don't care for them. Tomatoes are much the same way. Tomato sauces? Yum. Tomato soup? It's a required accompaniment to a grilled cheese sandwich. Tomato juice? I drink it regularly. An actual tomato? GET THAT REVOLTING PIECE OF SHIT AWAY FROM MY MOUTH.

I don't mind onion rings, nor onions cooked in a burger or maybe even a steak cooked with some onions. Otherwise though? They can fuck right off, they permeate and takeover the flavor of tons of foods they are cooked with and raw isn't any better. Salsa? Welp Tomatoes can fuck right off too so what do you think? Yes that means I'm not a fan of pasta that can also, wait for it... FUCK RIGHT OFF! 131 posts • Previous 1234 Next
