I'm not good at higher math. I'm fine with algebra and geometry but much less ok with trig, and I fail pretty hard at calculus.I don't really dig comics much.I don't like Star Trek all that much - to me it's an acceptably fun show which is totally undeserving of the level of fanaticism that people have for it.I can't program (unless SQL counts; I am not convinced).I can't get into SCA (tried a few events in high school/early college).I don't like anime. I am quite weirded out by the lengths to which non-Japanese people go in their love of all things Japanese (or @otherculture), for instance lots of cosplaying and manga and anime action figures and whatnot.

I just like owning computer products, and consumer electronics. I've built my own computer, I play games, I just recently purchased good headphones, keyboards, etc.I have never, ever finished a game. Either console or PC. Not even once. I usually found the higher levels too hard, or lost interest when I figured out how much time and effort it would take to get to the end.And I was never a gamer in the obsessive way that some are, it was always entertainment, not a compulsion.I'm also not that nerdy in general, I'm just good a understanding how tech works. I don't read tech manuals for fun, I don't do any coding, and I don't have an encyclopedic knowledge of anything.Compared to a lay person, I'm fairly nerdy, but some of the hardcore nerds I know make me feel downright boring. I just pickup and retain general bits of trivial knowledge well enough to impress/bore random people.

There have been a few exceptions, though, where I've suddenly noticed that a show that I like quite a bit has canned laughter (HIMYM, Rules of Engagement).Also, I really hate how all non-geeky people think that geeky people must absolutely love Big Bang Theory. I can't count the number of times that relatives or friends of friends have recommended it to me because "LOL YOU'RE A GEEK, SO ITS FUNNY!"No, it's not. Maybe it's not funny to me because I'm a geek, and all the forced "LOL HE'S A GEEK. THAT'S THE JOKE" jokes just seem... well, forced. And lame.

Actually, the first season of BBT was pretty good. Maybe even part of the second season. It had some sharp writing and had some good intellectual jokes.But then, like most network shows that start off with some sparkle and a hint of intelligence, it got dumbed down to the "purty girl and socially inept guys hurr hurr hurr" level of TV.I stopped watching it at the end of season 2 or part way through 3. Just not very good. (While I like the actors and think they did fine, it was the writing that killed it.)

Therefore it counts. On-topic:I don't get almost any anime. As soon as there's a character with giant quivering eyes, I'm out.JRPGs. I understand that video games have to resort to melodrama to convey anything, but holy shitfucking Sheogorath, these are above and beyond.RTS. If it's strategy, why do I have to be fast? And it isn't strategy, it's logistics. Also I'm not any good.MMOs. I had something snarky to say, here, but I started thinking about MMOs and started yawning too hard to finish. Note that I lay the blame for this 100% on myself - if any game presents me an opportunity to grind, I will do it until I can't. I won't enjoy it, but I'll feel compelled to make sure I've leveled as far as allowed.Comic books, not really. I love Preacher, and Gaiman's Sandman run, but nothing else has really grabbed me. There's just not enough meat there, IMO. This, I assume, is because I'm really only interested in the story; I don't appreciate the art as anything other than a way to save descriptive prose. A comic book is just not enough content.Red Dwarf. Meh. I sort of liked it before the android showed up, but can't say much more for it than that. I love all of Blackadder, so British comedy isn't the problem. And I love Dr. Who, so British camp isn't the problem. I don't know what the problem is.Lexx is terribad.LARPing holds no interest for me. And I haven't played a P&P RPG since...2002?Tabletop gaming also doesn't grab me. Necromunda was sort of fun, I guess...but most of that was the setup.I don't really like Terminator. I think Aliens is better than Alien. I love David Lynch's Dune (noting that I also love the book). In fact, I almost never am bothered by differences between the book and screen versions (except for the Dresden Files show; that was intolerable).<this space reserved for future edits>* I am using strict definitions for SQL in order to make the funny. Every implementation of SQL I've used has included some kind of bolt-on scripting constructs which made the implementation Turing complete.

Speaking of Dune, it has always annoyed me that it is somehow classified as science fiction, when it clearly shares more in common with high fantasy like Lord of the Rings....I realize this is the opposite of an unnerdy conversation. Apologies. Control Group

Unlike 'geek', I've always considered 'nerd' to be a perjorative. As such, I'm quite happy to say I'm not nerdy I'm also not all that geeky these days, I'm not a gamer, I don't even have a PC, or care about the setup of my old, out-of-date laptop. I couldn't even tell you what the latest CPUs are any more... I'm not even sure there's any aspect of me that is geeky, aside from being rather socially isolated in life. I mean, I have you lot for friends. How sad is that? Actually, I suck But at least I'm not a nerd, that's something at least. I think I can build on this.

Due to the lack of leisure time in my life, I have neglected the following:- Never watched Babylon 5, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, or any Dr. Who since Sylvester McCoy- Just started watching Firefly, got to Ep7 so far.- Just started watching Deep Space 9, on S1:Ep5.- Never seen, "Chronicles of Riddick," "John Mnemonic," "Tape Heads," nor about half of new superhero, fantasy, or sci-fi films shown in the last 15 years. Other confessions:- Never been a fan of the Transformers, any era.- Did not think "The Big Lebowski" or "Napoleon Dynamite" were funny. They both confused and bored me.- While things like Jar Jar and Ewoks were a little far-fetched, they did not annoy me NEARLY as much as other people. - I's rather use Linux, but think Outlook and think AD are pretty tight and well-made

But I can't watch ND, not even five minutes of it, without wanting to punch that kid in the jaw. And that Pedro, too. I want HIM to punch ND in the jaw. In fact, I'd rather watch 90 minutes of them beating each other senseless than 5 minutes of the original film.I may be on to something here.
