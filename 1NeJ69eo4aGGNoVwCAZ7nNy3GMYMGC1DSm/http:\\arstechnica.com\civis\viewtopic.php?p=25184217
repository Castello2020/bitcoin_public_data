Can't we do a bit better than "a coin flip" determines an El Nino or a La Nina?There is SOME collection of forcing variables that lead to one or the other. And not knowing those variables and the temperature of the Pacific appears to have a pretty large impact on our ability to predict atmospheric temperatures.

Perhaps La Nina might be part of the broader system response, a natural damper on temps, and indeed, a mechanism transporting heat into deep ocean waters.

For one thing, there will probably never exist computers with sufficient power to do that, and, even if they did, very tiny variations that are unaccounted for end up making a compounding difference as time advances. So weather prediction is inaccurate, and will always be inaccurate, and because of that weather cannot be accurately predicted way into the future.

For example, a paper I just saw today shows that El Nino/La Nina became more variable in the latter part of the 20th century. No sign of a La Nina bias, though.

Generally, I think El Nino/La Nina conditions can be reasonably predicted less than 12 months out. It's not a cyclical or simple phenomenon.

Does this mean that warming was over-estimated before the la Nina? IOW, does this study suggest that the "climate sensitivity" is lower than previously thought. If so, that is the big news here.I remember, years ago, some skeptic suggesting that a lot (he may have said "all") warming we'd seen in the 90s was due to el Nino. Unless I mis-remembered, this is probably a sign that the "mainstream scientists" and "skeptics" should spend more time working together and less time calling each other crooks.--t

It hasn't warmed for 15+ years, but the globe is still warming? The salient point is that none of the models allowed for greater than a 10yr pause in temps, with a 95% certainty. Those models were clearly wrong, and all their predictions go out the window.

The heat content of the combined system is still increasing apace. It's just that the el Nino/la Nina phenomenon allows larger or lesser proportions of the the heat retained to be dumped in atmosphere or ocean in particular intervals. Since water can absorb much more heat than air, even if the total heat energy added to the system goes up by much the same amount each year, it's more well hidden when more of the energy can be directly transfered into water.The 'skeptics' are still completely wrong and nutty since they use this kind of thing to claim 'not a problem' or 'system is countering effects' and such, which are patently false.

Sometimes it seems like a blessing that global consensus moves about as fast as molasses -- which has been set in concrete and nailed into the bedrock. If not we'd have spent the 60s incinerating our waste so that the ashes could be spread over the polar icecaps. You know, to prevent the impending Ice Age.

It has <i>never</i> been the case that a majority of climate scientists predicted an impending ice age or called for such an ice age to be prevented via human engineering.It is a myth that actual climate scientists had a consensus of an impending Ice Age (or any consensus at all). It is not a myth that the popular press picked up the impending Ice Age banner and ran with it.Most politicians were more worried about their reputations with Time or the New York Times than they were with some obscure academic journal. The minority of climatologists actually predicting global cooling would have been sufficient cover.We did however, have an entire multifaceted Cold War going on to distract anyone from doing anything particularly stupid with the climate.

Those models were clearly wrong, and all their predictions go out the window.Actually, if you account for variables that affect the atmospheric temperature and that the models were not intended to predict (El Nino/La Nina cycles, solar cycles, volcanic eruptions) then not only has the atmospheric warming continued unabated, the models are bang-on.In other words, any conclusion (for or against the AGW hypothesis or specific models) is invalid unless you determine what the temperature would have been without the effect of e.g. the prolonged solar minimum. As it turns out without that we would be even hotter. As predicted.

No. Because climate sensitivity to CO2 was not determined by picking a single decade or so in which either El Nino or La Nina dominated the short-term data. Climate "skeptics," on the other hand, seem very inclined to pick a decade with a dominant La Nina and say it means sensitivity should be lower. Like the last decade. Quote:I remember, years ago, some skeptic suggesting that a lot (he may have said "all") warming we'd seen in the 90s was due to el Nino.The previous record for warmest global temperature was 1998, which was due entirely to the unusually strong El Nino conditions of that year. But that doesn't explain the pattern of the entire decade, and it certainly doesn't explain the pattern of the entire 100+ years of warming. Over time, La Nina and El Nino events cancel out their effects on the temperature data: the highs offset the lows and the overall pattern is no trend caused by either one. This is why real climate scientists don't base claims of climate sensitivity on a single decade of temperature data. Climate itself is generally determined over periods of 30 years or so, because the year-to-year variation in temperatures is relatively high and short-term forcings like ENSO, volcanoes, and solar cycles work on the timescale of about a decade. By using multiple decades of data as the starting point, you allow these short-term factors to mostly cancel themselves out and reveal the underlying trend. It's necessary to separate the signal from the noise. Quote:Unless I mis-remembered, this is probably a sign that the "mainstream scientists" and "skeptics" should spend more time working together and less time calling each other crooks.The "skeptics" need to spend more time learning what they're talking about and how to do statistics. The real climate scientists have already mastered those things and know best how to apply them to the climate. ooostephen wrote:It hasn't warmed for 15+ years, but the globe is still warming? Surface temperatures haven't risen very much over the last 15 years. But the climate system itself is still warming. 90% of the energy goes into the oceans anyway, and during the last decade or so the deep oceans have stolen an unusually high amount of heat from the atmosphere. We're still packing additional energy into the climate system at the rate of four Hiroshima bombs every second. Quote:The salient point is that none of the models allowed for greater than a 10yr pause in temps, with a 95% certainty.Completely untrue. Climate model runs routinely simulate "pauses" of ten years or greater. We expect such things to happen because over the short term, climate data is noisy and sometimes factors can conspire to make warming seem to pause for a bit. But this does not impact the long-term trend. Quote:Those models were clearly wrong, and all their predictions go out the window.Well you're completely wrong about the models, so your arguments go out the window. But it's actually better to realize that ALL models are wrong, but some are useful. Climate models have consistently proven their reliability, in direct contrast to the nay-sayers' claims about them. You're just looking for any ill-informed excuse to dismiss them because you don't like what they show.*edited to fix links and formatting*

Did you notice that the El-Nino-sensitive ("improved") model had overly large drops after volcanic events? Well outside of their confidence intervals.I'd also add that the Foster and Rahmstorf paper is methodologically and data-wise naive, and ends with a sentence that projects a linear interpolation of a 30-year time series for decades into the future.

Unfortunately this entire topic has turned in to a religion. There should be no "sides" on this topic. Here's a question for both sides of this debate. As a believer in human based global climate warming, would you celebrate scientific discovery that the planet is, in fact not in such dire straights as you previously believed?As a skeptic of human influenced climate warming, under any circumstance would you embrace mitigation of human forcing on climate if enough scientific evidence was available to satisfy your objectivity?I don't think people that lean hard in either direction are willing to embrace those scenarios. Too bad you people are in charge both science (funding) and policy (politics). It's big damned mess.

But that doesn't explain the pattern of the entire decade, and it certainly doesn't explain the pattern of the entire 100+ years of warming. More to the point -- you can correct for the effect of La Nina/El Nino, plus other variables like solar output. You take out all the spikes and dips from all these effects, and you get a powerful warming trend that has only accelerated in the last decades.Fundamentally the CO2 greenhouse gas hypothesis is that the excess* CO2 in the atmosphere means that the earth retains more heat, and thus is warmer, than it would be without that excess. Both the models and reality are in solid agreement on this.* Obviously this doesn't apply just to the "excess" and the truth of this hypothesis is the only reason our planet is habitable, which is why it's so silly from the get-go to argue that increasing the amount of greenhouse gasses won't increase the equilibrium temperature.

The intent is to intimidate and silence opposition. Scientific progress without question, is enhanced by increased scrutiny. Scientists with integrity should welcome thoughtful criticisms without regard to, or in spite of motive (which may in many cases be unknowable).You cannot control reactions against a well-conceived position, no matter how shocking it may be to your sensibilities. You can, however control your response (making the message more "listenable"). Scientists need to focus on data, not personalities, recognizing the possibility of a wide latitude of interpretations that can run counter to any number of preconceived notions. This is true in all branches of science, but especially true in emerging fields that rely heavily upon models.

The idea that some people want AGW or would refuse new evidence that disproves it is patently absurd.OTOH, it's been demonstrated plenty of times that no amount of evidence would convince many deniers.

Not to wax nostalgic on y'all, but Entergy has announced it will shutdown Vermont Yankee at the end of next year. This 600 MW BWR supplies nearly three-fourths of Vermont's electricity. Vermont Yankee went online in November 1972 and recently received a 20 year extension from NRC for its operating license. But it is not economically competitive with cut-rate natural gas and irrationally subsidized wind. Replacing VY's 600 MW(e) with natural gas will emit 2.5 million tonnes CO2 each year. 600 MW(e) with 90% capacity factor would need 810 2MW wind turbines at 33% capacity factor. NPP and wind both need 100% backup -- with nuclear you need it much less often but for longer intervals when you do. In three years levelized cost of wind will be about $97/MWh, CCGT about $63/MWh, 2009 dollars. Wind's current $22/MWh pre-tax PTC makes the two LCOE sorta kinda equivalent (as it amounts to an after-tax $33). These levelized costs are marginal costs of wind at its current low penetration of 3.4%. Cost of wind are projected to increase by at least 50% at total renewable penetration of 72%. But no one is planning for that.Sources: True Cost of Coal Power and NREL Renewable Energy Futures Study

So, when do the models say the warming will start back up? Is there any logic to it or are we just following this simple rule:If data does not support narrative, change narrative to support agenda.
