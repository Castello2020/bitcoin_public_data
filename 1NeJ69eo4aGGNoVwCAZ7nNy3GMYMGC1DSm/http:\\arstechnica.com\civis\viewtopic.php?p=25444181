Could have bought a data center from Google or Facebook, but no, they had to be fancy and spend a lot more to get a worse result.

The American people know that, if they pray and believe hard enough, Divine STUXNET will smite their enemies with bolts of lightning. Or by over stressing the motors in uranium enrichment equipment.I'm a bit relieve the NSA doesn't appear to have uranium enriching equipment.

There's actually something to be said for just buying huge EC2/Azure instances and leaving the datacentering to the experts. And then if they ever lose their data, they can just employ the backdoors they designed into MS's software in the first place to get it back.

Civil disobedience? Less likely with the Army than your average civilian, but I know if someone tried to get me to build an NSA data center right now, I'd be seriously tempted to induce 'construction accidents.'

We had a main switch blow at my lab one time. Big old bang we thought something blew-up. Evacuated two buildings, had the fire department in for hours. The electrical guys tore-down and rebuilt the system, never did find anything wrong. Not sure what happened, we were not even drawing much power at the time, none of the high power stuff was even turned on. Has not happened since. That was less than a megawatt system, a multi megawatt power system losing it is probably exciting.

Datacenter power systems are complex because they have to switch between multiple power sources without discontinuing flow to the hardware. Dealing with unstable voltage is a tricky problem of electrical engineering but its the materials engineering side that generally causes the most grief. Simply, the breakers get hot. Really hot. Instantly. Hot enough to explode; which is why in power substations all the parts are encased in armored steel shells. A breaker in a commercial datacenter power management center is generally a ceramic brick about 2" on each side with contacts on the sides. When they explode they tend to crack and blow vaporized metal gunk out the fissure like the liquid metal penetrator of an anti-tank rocket. The metal contacts and the way they're bolted in tends to keep the ceramic parts intact once the molten innards escape, and when the metal remnants cool all the chunks are stuck together.

The variables I can think of in Arc Flashes is voltage delta's between ends of the arc, air quality variables, and distances between the arcpoints. If there's some persistent change reducing potential needed for an arc due to some obscure air handling condition, then that could be it. Perhaps some collateral damage to other parts? I've never seen an Arc occur in my IT lifetime, but the electricians and facilities folks take the risk of them quite seriously.*Unless static sparks count as arcs, but I think we're typically talking about transformer equipment stepping down line voltage to three phase or somesuch.

Could it be sabotage? There are a lot of people who would prefer if the datacenter wasn't completed.

There are several remote admin and phonehome capabilities in the SquareD style equipment. The possibility of vulnerabilities being exploited at that level is interesting to consider.

I find myself in a peculiar situation.On the one hand, I don't see why the hell we're investing 1.4 billion in a massive datacenter to spy on *.On the other, if they're going to spent 1.4 billion, I would like to see the damn thing at least work.

If they are really getting arc flashes on high power equipment, there's a good chance there the initial cause of the arc flash vaporized into a fiery ball of plasma.

They can spy the whole world from a distance, but cannot even discover what's happening in their own buildings. Oh, the irony

With the scale of this one - no it doesn't have a yottabyte like some claim, but still a lot of storage - they really should be relying on experts that have experience with giant datacenters. There are not many.

dtich wrote:oh they should just hire google or amazon to do it for them. two hands for beginners... Several problems with this. First off, there likely isn't enough storage and/or processing power available from Google or Amazon. That in itself is kinda scary. Secondly, the NSA needs to have end-to-end security as well as chain of custody on the hardware to prevent any sabotage. This is something that the NSA shoudl genuinely be handing itself.On that note, the NSA does have other data centers. Their facility in Fort Meade is estimated to consume between 70 and 90 megawatts and that's smaller than what is being built in Utah. I would fathom that the Utah data center is being designed for over 100 megawatts of power consumption.
