Here's a funny situation: I registered for Pandora a long time ago. I get a "welcome to pandora" email today. I note the email address is the same as mine, minus the ".". I.e. I'm first.last@gmail.com and they registered under firstlast@gmail.comAs most of you probably know, Gmail doesn't allow you to register variations of someone's existing user ID where the difference is only a period, and will route any email to firstlast@gmail to first.last@gmail.So I tried logging into Pandora with the firstlast@gmail, didn't known the password. Requested my password, it sends it to MY email address, which I now log in and change it.So now I've locked the owner out of his pandora account because he registered it with my email address. Why would they possibly do that when they can't possibly own that email address?Amusingly the kid is 15 according to his birthdate.

Well he likely never had access to it, since it was just registered today. Either it was a mistype, or he thought his gmail address was valid.A. I don't see a reason why you had to change his password, kind of a dick thing to do.B. Just ignore it, who cares.C. Why is this even in the MCO?

It's kind of a dick thing to use someone else's email address. Even if unintentional, I don't care his reasoning, I don't want my email address used. He MUST know he doesn't have my email address registered.B. Too late. I did write to the company and they said they appreciate me letting them know.C. I couldn't figure out which section to post it in, seemed appropriate as I use Pandora on my iPhone

I get people thinking my gmail address is theirs all the time. I think one guy had it printed on his business card or something, because after some solar energy conference (which I knew he attended because I got his confirmation email) a ton of venders sent me messages about "Thanks for visiting our booth!" I've also gotten order confirmations with names and addresses, cell phone bill reminders with phone number and account balance, and sexually explicit emails from an exec of a social media company to his "top" detailing what he'd like to happen for his birthday.

I have had this happen on Amazon and southwest airlines, on Amazon I locked 'em out and then contacted support, Southwest I emailed them telling them an OMG TERRORIST!!! had borrowed my email.I also get people's bank account details from relatives trying to resolve wills, and email for various Boards I am apparently apart of... Who knew!(I have a common first and last name) it would look like J.A.Smith@gmail.com if my name was John Alexander Smith.

I always LOVE these Gmail posts. Because time after time, I get told that "no Gmail addresses ever duplicate" yet, I have no less than 5 women who share my Gmail account for some reason. They all have their names as firstlast@gmail.com, and mine was a beta name with a period in betweeen (which we all know means nothing) but due to this I get so much stuff it's incredible. I have spoken with an FBI agent after someone interviewed with them. I have explianed to a young woman's mother why I thought she might want to tell her daughter to stop taking nude pictures of herself and leaving herself notes on which guy gets which pics. I have spoken to the Grand Canyon Online University and explained that I do not in fact teach at their school and that their repeated attempts to coerce me due to my prior teaching assignments with them is falling on deaf ears. I have dealt with numerous family reunions that I faield to show up for "even though we reminded you weekly". I have talked to medical bill collectors, credit collectors, a sex linme that claims I defaulted them somehow, and a bakery who I failed to pay at my wedding to a guy named Cyrus (last name is my name).It's just nutty how bad it is. I even call the people direct when I get phone numbers from their confirmation of flights or reservations somewhere and they just tell me I'm wrong and I say okay and let it go. Ignorance may be bliss but I wnder how one could miss so many things like that and either be that stupid.... or they are getting some emails somehow.

I e-mailed him, forwarded his mail, and we laughed about it. But it didn't stop. After a while, I gave up, and since about the middle of 2010 I just log on to whatever the service is, change all of his info to curse-filled gibberish (Address: "123 YOURE A FUCKING IDIOT WHO CANT REMEMBER HIS EMAIL ST."), fix the e-mail address, and then log out & request a password reset so he gets the updated note. Hasn't really helped.For the two job offers, I've replied saying that I'm not the intended recipient, but that they should be aware that they're about to hire someone who's so stupid that he's been using the wrong e-mail address for a couple of years.

How did you figure out his real email address? See, I have no idea what my doppleganger's email is.Also doesn't help that I share the name of a guy who settled for millions of dollars with a very popular but incredibly weird now dead celebrity who's initials are "Michael Jackson". You should have seen the Facebook messages! And when I'd tell them off that they perhaps should not go around the internet threatening strangers they'd get all indignant and defensive. I'd ask them if their parents were related.

I keep receiving notifications from Chase.I once declined a transaction that requested approval. I had hoped that declining a transaction would be an incentive to fix the issue, nope. I received a mortgage payment notification the other day.

Some people were understanding, others totally confused and some hostile. One person got upset that I was using her cousins name. Another couldn't comprehend that the email was wrong and insisted that I had applied for a job and was trying to dodger her.No one has given me the real email of this guy though. :/

I own firstlast.org. A real estate agent in Florida owns firstlast.com.I have firstlast@gmail.com. The same real estate agent has firstmlast@gmail.com.I get a ridiculous number of emails about real estate transactions. This was particularly confusing because I used to do residential real estate closings. Now, every time I get one of these messages, I answer back and give the correct address (copying the right guy, etc), but he never has said thank you for that. I've long considered screwing up one of this guy's deals to teach him a lesson.

I suffer from a similar problem, but with my Apple ID: apparently it's popular amongst forgetful people, since I get a password reset e-mail about once a week, that I didn't request. Most of them are in English, some in Japanese, but I've also seen ones in French and Spanish.This would have been only a minor annoyance if not for the fact that Apple locks your account if there are too many password reset attempts. So invariably it ends up locked when I'm about to use it, and I have to reset it from iforgot.apple.com (I did not forget, dammit! ).In fact, I never memorized it because it's kept in my keychain. Alas, it's got even more annoying recently, as the reset interface now requires you to type in the password manually. Thank god I could bypass it by turning off JavaScript temporarily. They'd better not switch to using a soft keyboard like many banks like to use for their "two-factor" authentication. I thought I've shared my frustration before, but a quick search turned up nothing...

Kid registers with Pandora using a fake email address, which happens to be Saint's. The intention is to obviously send the spam elsewhere. I have no problem with Saint changing the Pandora password as revenge. Kid probably thought most likely the confirm email would end up in some old geezer's inbox and would be too afraid to do anything with it. I applaud Saint for kicking the youngster off his lawn.

There is a woman that constantly tries to use my wife's gmail address. She has even tried to have my wife's gmail password reset. This woman is a junkie scumbag meth-head who regularly is in contact with her lawyer trying to get advice on how to screw her husband over in their divorce. She is also asking for advice on how to fill out insurance forms for her 'injuries' at multiple work places. I swear, she gets a job, gets fired, and then emails her lawyer to find out how to screw them over.I regularly reset her passwords. I wanted to screw with her Plenty of Fish account by posting fake details, but my wife made me just reset the password. For some reason she really panicked over that one, and kept trying to reset it again. She must have tried about five or six times.Her husband emailed 'her' about the divorce, and my wife responded that she was sick and tired of reading all of these personal details about their life. He got belligerent, and told my wife off. She then emailed him copies of the correspondence that she had received, and highlited the incorrect email address. We have not heard anything about their divorce since.It just makes me wonder, when she does not receive any response to her emails, what goes through her head? Is she on the other side of this going on about how 'hackers' are ruining her life, and stealing all of her personal details? Jables

I got in early enough that I use my last name only. It's unusual, but I have one dude with my last name who occasionally overlaps. I get a few oddball things on his behalf, including his life insurance updates/billing notices. There's not enough info into there to contact him, and he's in another country. I have no idea what email he writes down that ends up as my own.

I registered with gmail very early and chose a name that matches up with a very common last name in Japanese. I regularly get all kinds of ridiculous emails from many different Japanese people. I continually receive some guy's itunes receipts so I know everything he buys, someone else's hotel stay receipts, shipping confirmations (so I receive the full address), obscene amounts of spam addressed to someone who is not me, and more. I've even gotten stuff that is clearly work related like spreadsheets and shipping manifests. Occasionally I will also get pictures from someone's stupid PTA events or whatever in Hawaii. I can't even count the number of times I've unsubscribed myself from stupid mailing lists. There is someone in Australia that keeps signing up for some damn casino mailing list that I will get every few months. I think I've unsubscribed from that one more than 4 times already.

Sigh...I remember the good old days when I'd get people leaving messages on my answering machine for people who don't live here, even though the outgoing message clearly lists my name, and I'd get rude replies when I'd call them back to let them know they didn't leave a message for the person they thought they had. These days I just delete the messages and if Person X misses their gyno appointment it's no skin off my...nose.The only email screwup I've had is for someone who apparently set up a Netflix account using my email; I reset the PW and confirmed there's none of my personal info attached, then left it alone.(and yes, "derp-elganger" is truly awesome and I will be using it whenever possible)

I still blame some of these issues entirely on Google, not the individuals. They let people create email addresses with dots in the name and then didn't process them properly. I don't know if that's been fixed, I pretty sure they've claimed it's never been an issue, but it absolutely has.
