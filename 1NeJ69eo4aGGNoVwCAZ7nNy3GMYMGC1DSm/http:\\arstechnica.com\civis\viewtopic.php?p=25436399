Quote:The history of the tech industry is littered with the dead—companies that rode a wave of innovation and wiped out hard. Some rode core successes for years, such as Wang, Digital Equipment, and Palm. Others, like Pets.com, crashed early and hard because of failures in execution.How much of the Pets.com crash was because the economy crashed as well?

Too much money spent on funny ad campaigns, not enough on selling stuff.[edited - used "actually" too many times in one sentence!]

The text on Qualcomm overstates the importance of CDMA a bit, and is incorrect on one detail:Quote:Since those earliest demonstrations, the basic framework Qualcomm built has gone on to be the basis for almost every major cellular communications platform around the globe, from GSM to LTE.The original GSM was based on a TDMA architecture. The 3GSM industry group then switched to a CDMA setup for the 3G iteration of the standard, but the original (and most widely deployed) had nothing to do with CDMA.

Nice article for a Monday morning read. Couple of companies (like Corning) weren't on my radar, despite my appetite for How It's Made (for non-US readers, a TV show about how the mundane things in life are made).

Kinda disappointed that Motorola isn't on there. They did pioneer the cell phone and a bunch of other areas.

If only TI would innvovate on the calculator front. It must now cost them now, what, 1$ to make a ti-83 that sells for 99$? Mean while, a Kindle HD only costs 140...Obligatory:http://xkcd.com/768/

Interesting article, and I enjoyed seeing TI get some love. I do have one small nit: Apple starts out with an apologetic statement to non-apple 'fans', then has to make statements about android and google. Come on, just celebrate the damn company and its history without the fanboy junk. You didn't apologize for including microsoft or google.

My current TI graphing calculator has a full color screen, and has enough processing power that it can run a GBA emulator. Much better than a Ti-83, don't you think?

They do lead in some tech fields still, just nothing consumer facing anymore. And they have been around since the 19th century.

Part of me thinks Nintendo should be on the list. The Famicom/NES basically single-handedly saved the video game industry after the crash of '84 and the SNES/Super Famicom, N64, and the multiple variants of the Gameboy were the industry leaders of most of the 90s. Even though its Wii U system isn't exactly selling, one could argue that Nintendo is the current leading innovator of motion controls, not to mention the 3DS is still the industry leader in mobile gaming and the company itself is the largest video game company by revenue. Not too shabby for a company founded in 1889 to produce hanafuda.Anyway, good article.

"Dont mess with Texas Instruments" unless your Commodore and drive them the fuck out of the home computer market!No mention of Commodore and its vertical integration that basically drove home computer prices into the ground and was responsible for making it affordable for avergage joes?

If you're not familiar with the Skunkworks, go read it up. It's a fascinating story of how the americans defeated the Mig russian aircraft supremacy in a time where the much needed Titanium material was in such short supply that the russians controlled the market, leading the CIA to set up a pyramid of shell corporations to trick the russians into selling it to them, then used it to build the planes that would dominate the sky.EDIT: Removed incorrectly cited plane model

Really, why would they do that?it's not like they will sell loads more if it would be like 40 instead of 80 usd...

My question is how many of these companies will still be around in 100 years? We have seen companies rise and fall on their own merits and failures. Some of these companies like IBM and Xerox have really dropped the tech ball in the past with failure to see passed their own preconcieved notions. Others only really dominate by market share like Microsoft. Then there is Apple, and whether it can live past one of its creators. We know what Apple is like with Steve Jobs, then without Steve Jobs, then with Steve Jobs again, and now it's once again without Steve Jobs. Good article, BTW. I am just suprised no automotive company made it into the 15.

The old batch that have already paid for their calculators graduate and a new batch are coming in and will buy new calculators at vastly inflated prices guaranteed! What could be better than that!

The long-time industry giants seem content with just updating their best sellers with a few more MPG each year, meanwhile upstarts like Telsa are pushing forward new technologies and have become the leading innovators in the industry.

While you mention TI's DLP chip in the context of a 3DTV, I find it odd you don't mention their DLP chips own virtually the entire digital cinema world, and a huge percentage of the rest of the projection world, down to the smallest pico units that are being integrated into cell phone devices.Also, Quote: These original silicon transistors had many moving parts that required hand-soldering.Moving parts? Separate parts maybe?

But I don't think you can separate fanboyism and Apple. They go together like politics and corruption.And I was once a long time Apple fanboy myself. Mac developer from 1984 to 1997.It's like a religion. A cult. No, really. True fanboys make their annual pilgrimage to the developer's conference to hear their messiah speak. They cheer at every word -- even if it is directly contradictory to what was said last year. ("who needs multitasking on a phone" -- "we now have multitasking on the iPhone", and other examples)It's not that Apple doesn't make great products. It's just that people need to stop treating it like joining a cult. It's been like that, elitism, smugness and all, as long as I've known it. And I've done it myself.

Their films are used on just as many displays as Gorilla Glass. Not to mention the hundreds of other products they have made over the decade that have gone into various devices. What 3M doesn't have is a Steve Jobs story like Corning (and I'll admit the Gorilla Glass iPhone story is pretty compelling).

They are antiquated, and it is just a matter of time before their phased out of the system. The only thing they have going is momentum at the moment.Most of TI's business is in chip sales, and calculators were just a retail product to that end.
