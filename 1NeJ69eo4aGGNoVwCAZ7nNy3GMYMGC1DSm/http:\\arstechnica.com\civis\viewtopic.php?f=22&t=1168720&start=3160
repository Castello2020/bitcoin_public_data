I might consider trying to find a more balanced reactor design that uses Uranium as well just to get more juice out of it. Our Mindcrack reactor uses two quad thorium rods and eight single uranium rods (which have to be replaced 4x as often as the Thorium rods). This is great because when you fuge uranium dust you get 16 uranium rods and IIRC 4 thorium rods per cycle, plus a Plutonium rod. You can also fuge depleted uranium rods for more thorium rods if you don't want to mess with breeder reactors. Even with two full speed Quarries running almost nonstop, that fairly modest 230EU/t reactor was burning up uranium faster than the quarries could replenish it. We were lucky that I waited a long time to build it so we could start off with a huge stockpile of uranium. IMHO, IC2 could easily double the runtime on the Uranium rods without unbalacing them. Forms of energy generation I considered but never implemented: Tree farm attached to a furnace that pumps out charcoal into simple IC2 generators. The downside is that IC2 gens output a pathetic 10EU/t trickle of power, so you would need a ton of them, and the total efficiency isn't great because the conversion process from logs to charcoal is kind of expensive and Charcoal doesn't burn terribly long. It might be more efficient to put the charcoal in Forestry's hobby steam engines and use that to drive a magma crucible converting Netherrack into lava to pipe into a Gregtech Thermal gen, but the breathtaking complexity of that setup is its own problem. The only reason this might work is because forestry for some reason gives you a lot more power per chunk of charcoal than most mods. If you really wanted to make it complicated you could run that coal through a Coke oven first to give it a longer burn time, and use the Creosote to run a semifluid gen for a little extra power.You get 1 thorium dust per monazite ore. A typical quarry will net around 12-20 monazite = profit.

Do you have to electrolyze the Monazite to get that? My experiance with that ore is that grinders won't process it and cooking it just gives you forcicium.

The basic solar panel isn't nearly as abusive as the advanced ones, simply because they take up so much space and require so much tin wire that ridiculous huge deployments become self limiting. Having to install a 32x16 array is a lot more work than plopping down one Ultimate Hybrid panel. Really, the high power solar panels don't make any more sense than a high power wind or water either. You can't make a super powerful real life solar panel by stacking 512 panels on top of one another. You're ultimately limited by the amount of total energy in the sunbeam and the size of your panel.Truth.I think rather than nerfing solar (I've never used them, even in tekkit), making other shit more viable would be better. Like if water mills prefered running water and became more efficient the more of them in a straight line you had. Maybe then you'd see cool damn type setups just because. Now? No one uses them.Thermal I feel is fine where it is, unless you go cheaty nether lava (which still requires tesseracts) it's pretty stupid how complex it is. It's where oil *SHOULD* be. Oil is meh. I want to like it. I like farming stuff. Oil generation is broken and to sparse. Each oil block should provide 4,000 mb worth is where I feel the ratio should be. Rather than the 1:1 it is now.Wind? Lol.Generators + tree farms are actually silly easy. I almost did this. Usually my first 4 or so real days in FTB/Tekkit I am running of 4-5 generators and charcoal. Blaze farm + generators is equally silly, at least from my creative tests.Nuclear is good. In tekkit it was retarded expensive. In FTB it is more reasonable. I still feel that reactor components and needlessly fiddly, and that shit should stack FFS. Fuel can be a problem unless you quarry constantly. If you want to go thorium, you pretty much have to go out yourself to silk touch coal.Fusion is to far out for me to have even have looked at yet. Thumb suck estimation is that the support network you would need to create the fusion "fuel" would make it not worth it.jandrese wrote:Do you have to electrolyze the Monazite to get that?

Making Deuterium and Tritium cells for the Fusion plant is by far the easiest part of making it. It needs a fair number of machines (QcD calculated 5 Electrolyzers and 18 'fuges), but what you're doing is pretty straightforward. Electrolyzers are fed by Aqua Accumulators to make hydrogen cells. The Hydrogen cells are then fuged to make Deuterium Cells, and most of those get fuged again to make Tritrium cells. Then you just load them into the reactor and pull the used cells to to recycle them.

Also the fusion reactor yields helium, which you could 'fuge to get He-3 and run that with Tritium to get even more power! (Or just quarry the end and 'lyze the endstone dust for even more He-3)

Seems like it doesn't make sense to try to switch once you've made the big energy investment in getting it running in the first place. The He-3/Tritium reaction just lasts twice as long as the regular one, so it's kind of pointless if you have sufficient infrastructure for 24/7 reactor operation anyway, which you will because that infrastructure is several orders of magnitude easier to build than the reactor itself.

Did you know you can harvest two layers of reed farm with a single sugarcane harvester? If you place the harvester at the dirt level of the top stack, and put one layer of blocks below that, then set up the lower farm such that the reeds touch the ceiling when fully grown, then the harvester will handle both levels at once. We only have two harvesters for the 4 layer farm on Mindcrack, which is good because harvester are fairly expensive in the early game when you want to get your power systems up and running as soon as possible.

Also, the Xycraft 12x12x12 tanks are ass simple to make and are far, far cheaper than the railcraft ones with the same functionality, but I don't think they're in direwolf.

wow, I just read through the wiki about the multifarms, and they really seem to be overly complicated. Although it appears that its possible to do a two level cane farm (or a three level wheat farm) with just one control structure. Not sure if that would actually work in the game though. Also a quick bit of math makes the 3x5 is the most efficient design, you get 156 farm blocks (per level) from just 60 control blocks (ratio of 2.6:1).TL;DR - I appears it may be possible to approach the output of a single layered reed farm with a double layered multifarm. Although it will costs 10 diamond w/ 2 spare tubes, compared to just 4 diamond the old way.

Here's a screenshot of our boiler setup. No need to pipe steam anywhere, just use it locally. Obviously if you're using LP boilers you only want to install half as many engines. As you can tell, space was at a bit of a premium for us, since we were keeping our entire workshop inside of a 3x3 chunkloader. The downside of xycraft tanks is that Nuclear Control liquid readers don't work in them. Nuclear control is pretty cool. I played around with it a bit on MindCrack:I should have tossed some stuff in the electrolyzer just to make the base power go above 0.

While you can't do a double layer reed farm, you can do a double layer farm of anything that only grows 1 or 2 high. So wheat, potatoes, carrots, netherwart, etc... are all valid options. Shame you can't mix and match the layers, with a wheat farm on the bottom and a tree farm on top or something.

BTW Jand, when we were trying to figure out the issue with the super-retard-ensators, I was reading through greg's changelog and *SURPRISE!!* he nerfed thorium cell burn time by 50% in the latest builds. So just an FYI if you want to recreate the setup in a future version.Edit: He also changed the fusion reactor, so if we weren't replacing the map anyway it would have eventually turned into a Fusion Computer and we'd have to make a new one!!!!

His new fusion reactor is even more retarded too. It puts out more energy, but people were estimating that you would need on the order of 144 fuges to keep it running now.

Just a note -- our Ultimate server is currently still using the default Gregtech config. That'll change very soon, and will require a manual cfg update on the clients, as it did before. Not hard to do, just a matter of replacing a couple of files in your ftb/Ultimate directory.

Oh yeah, Ghasts are obnoxious. The rule of thumb is: Don't leave the caves unless you have a bow or a jetpack. When attacking Ghasts only the tentacles are vulnerable to damage. Theoretically you can bat their projectiles back at them, and there is even an achievement for killing a ghast with its own fireball, but that's a dangerous game. The good news is that Ghasts have a puny little health bar so Arrows are deadly to them. Cabal wrote:Are you turning off "Hard Mode"? What's the big change there (Mass Fab?)?Hard Mode hits a large number of recipes as it turns out. The most basic IC2 machines become very expensive (the Macerator requires three diamonds for example) and the renewable power generators also become very late game items. The mass fab recipe is removed, many other recipes are nerfed (only 2 bronze for 3 copper and 1 tin instead of 4, and in the next version that gets reduced to 1 bronze), some recipes move over to the Rolling Machine (like mixed metal ingots) because everybody hates the rolling machine. Changing the configs server side is no problem, but on the client side it is a bit of a pain because you have to set the files as read only or the launcher will overwrite them every time it starts. If you don't change the client side configs the game will still work, but NEI will be wrong on a lot of recipes. I have to apologize for this. I thought that only Mindcrack left Gregtech on its stupid default setting, because who wants to deal with Gregtech hard mode BS, but apparently Ultimate wanted to as well.Anyway, none of that matters because I've turned off all of that braindamage (I think). You will need to unpack this zip file in the config directory on your ultimate install. You will then need to set all three files to read only so they don't get overwritten.

I didn't hear about the Advanced Solar nerf. I can't say I'm surprised though, Advanced Solars make the Fusion plant a total joke.One thing that strikes me is just how much stuff in Gregtech is 100% absolutely without purpose, and how much of the other stuff is way way way more effort than it is worth. And his response to people not using his utterly overpriced machine that is not as good as the generic machine in another modpack? Nerf the other modpack. It's a shame that there are some cool concepts in there ('fuging compounds to separate the materials for instance), but so much of the mod is just utterly bananas. The only saving grace is that most of the braindamage can be disabled in the config files.One thing that absolutely did not need to happen was his new Fusion plant. The old plant was already crazy hard to build and put out enough energy that it was somewhat troublesome from a lag standpoint. Making it even bigger and harder to build and put out more energy is totally unnecessary IMHO. Making it require a massive array of somewhat laggy centrifuges is not a good idea either.

In that Tier 2 solar takes Iridium now. Which if you had, you would not give a shit about solars, and would be riding iridium plated kitten powered death gliders or some shit.It's just totally nonsense to introduce it that early in the tech tree.

Fess up time: I've been noodling around in the Twilight Forest, clearing a labyrinth or two and failing at Lich's et al. I keep on failing at making the maps - I thought it was because my portal was in the middle and underneath the canopy of one of those huge forests. Some of the maps would show something, but usually only ABOVE the canopy, or an already completed small scale lich tower or something else inexplicable. 4 or 5 attempts later, I happen to watch Direwolf's latest video and realise I'd been making the map with the OTHER type of map focus rather than the 'golden' raven feather. *sigh*

Well specifically my apprehension stems from the fact that the new farms take fertilizer and it's analogues. Which of course is also used in great quantities to make Biofuel.whats the consumption rate like for fertilizer?The rest of it is an engineering problem. It's the supply ones that can't be solved after you flip enough turtles on the way down.

It depends on what you are growing, but the multifarm is pretty parsimonious with fertilizer. I don't even bother with fancy feeding systems, I just stick a hopper on top and drop in 4 stacks of fertilizer. It lasts quite a long time. Also, I have not tested this yet, but supposedly only apatite based fertilizer will be accepted. So you can't put compost in there like the farms of old--use it in the Fermenter instead. IC2 fertilizer might work as well thanks to the Forge Dictionary, but I have not tested it. Also, if you're looking for more Apatite, go up to the mountains. Apatite only spawns in rock at y > 64, so it almost never appears in flat biomes like deserts and plains. You need to flatten some mountains to find it. The good news is that a single apatite deposit will last you a long long time, due to the way it spawns in ginormous deposits. Check out ftbwiki.org for some screenshots showing how the different sections of the multifarm are laid out. The upshot is the North and South sections are quite a bit smaller than the East and West sections, so take that into account when planning what each quadrant will grow.

Fantastic. My usual problem just got even better - whenever I use a quarry in the Twilight Forest, the quarry and connected equipment disappears on restart. Annoying but not too bad as I just cheat the items back in and set it back up.This time though, it decided to build a new chunk right on top of the quarry item.I don't even think that tree on top of it was even there initially.edit: apparently the issue is caused by enderchests. Use item tesseracts and all is good. Hopefully this also fixes the issue with portals resetting in the TF.
