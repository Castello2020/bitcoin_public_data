Yeah, they are sharp. Kevlar gloves are your friend. Alternatively, or for a bit of variety, try spaghetti squash as well.As for me, down three pounds in a week that included a wedding. I am exercising a few days a week to get back into it, and eating a very veggie and lean meat filled diet, with a bit of brown rice or bread thrown in once in a while. As a bonus, I am also more alert, and therefore drinking less coffee.

I feel like I went too far getting rid of all sugar this week. I'm going to start eating fruit again and hope that doesn't negatively affect my tongue re-training (to get to the point where avoiding candy bars isn't just a matter of willpower but an aversion to nasty tasting processed sugar).I also think I'm going to start working out now. My wife keeps telling me that it's easier for men to gain muscle that helps burn more calories throughout the day. I want in on that.

Haven't moved much in the past 2-3 weeks still bouncing between 205 and 210 although now that crossfit is ramping up I'm hoping to still be able to get under 200 for the race. It's just been tough with traveling and events the last couple of weeks and I have opening night for Peter Pan tomorrow so I haven't had time to prep much healthy food. Next three weeks are going to need to be focused.

I dropped off the wagon because it got stressful with the final paper, presentation, and exam for my class and big meetings for work which involved some 14 hour days. Getting back on the wagon once I have a free moment to go grocery shopping (which I should have done last night, but all I wanted to do was dick around on my first free night in a while).

I want in on that.You definitely should be working out. Regular exercise is the healthiest thing you can do for yourself, even if it's only 15-20 minutes a few times a week.This is personal preference, but I find it's a lot easier to control my exercise level than it is to control my diet. If I run a few miles in the morning I can still eat a cheeseburger and drink a couple beers without feeling guilty. I might not lose any weight that day, but it doesn't set me back like it would if I was only counting calories.

Its been a month since I commited to get rid of 10 or more pounds. I have failed, I am down 9. Not too bad I guess, catch is I am out of town for 5 days as of Wednesday which won't be helpful. Still, 9 pounds, at least I am under 155 now. Fail but still small win imho.

Today marks one year since I committed to resolving my weight problems once and for all. I guess I'm posting not for congratulations or positive feedback, I get quite a bit of that in real life, but more for anyone else on Ars that silently reads these threads and needs some kind of motivation. Perhaps this can help. I have been pretty unhappy with my weight for a long time, starting from high school I'd creaped up from 195 to finally 324 when I stepped on the scales May 16, 2011. Last winter I finally resolved to do something about it. I'd like to thank dferrantino for his comment in Control Group's thread on home workouts. While nothing there screams inspiration, the response and comments on the book made me think it was worth at least reading. I purchased the 4 Hour Body after reading that thread, and slowly started weaning myself off the grains and sugars. May 16th was my official start date, and I haven't looked back. My philosophy has generally shifted since the start, I'm now eating a more Paleo specific diet than suggested by Ferris, but I think the most important thing for me was committing to a plan and focusing on preparing my own meals. Today I eat out maybe 1 meal per week (it wasn't uncommon for me to do 10+ previously), I generally just buy raw meats and vegetables and prepare everything from scratch. My smoker has made making a weeks worth of protein easy, and adds tons of delicious calorie/carb/whatever free flavor to everything. Burying the lead a bit, but this morning was day 367 (screw leap year) and I weighed 216.2lbs. I've lost 1/3rd of my body weight in the last year, without making any changes to physical activity (intentional, for obstinate reasons). This has solely been the result of moderating what I eat. I'm not done, and today I start the second phase which does introduce physical activity, but I thought a little post for my anniversary was appropriate. One last thanks, to GodFather for subtractthefat.com. I know there are other trackers, but seeing the regular references to it on ars and seeing all the posts of graphs in this thread made it an obvious choice to use. Having that daily data has actually helped me more than I'd have imagined. So, here's my 1 year chart.

Hell yea dude! I've been stuck hovering around 205 forever. I just need to get to 195 to hit my 100lbs mark myself and I thought I'd have it after having a good first quarter but mid-april until about Tuesday have just been bad with tons of eating out and traveling. 5 straight days of performances coming up (peter pan then 2 improv shows monday and tuesday) mean I'll be eating out and celebrating a lot so I'm not too hopeful, but maybe by June I'll break through. It is definitely doable for those who want it, and its not ALL that hard.

Excellent work! Since you own the book, what are your opinions on the workout plans within? I need to get into things, and I plan to start with a bodyweight workout to start. It is also possible that with my back injury I may never be able to weightlift again, and so I am looking at things like calisthenics, isometrics, etc. From the linked thread I am considering buying Ross's book, but I really need to start on this ASAP. I know I am well above 360ish because my scale errors out, and I need to get my health back in line.*edit* And one major problem is that I have no place to do pull-ups. I really do not trust any pullup bar to hold me at this point.

It takes more mental effort than anything else to commit to a plan, and more to stick the course, but for me the positive feedback I got from the scale and from my clothes reinforced the need/desire to stick to the plan.

I can't recall the thread that started me thinking about bodyweight exercises (though the Lounge does inspire me in most things), but I eventually found the book "You Are Your Own Gym" by Mark Lauren and the corresponding Android app which go into far more detail on bodyweight exercises and a staggered training program. I haven't actually started it yet, this evening is workout #1, but a friend has finished the first 10 week program and really looks great so far. Mark's got variants on each type of exercise, so if you can't do a pullup (I can't) there are alternatives to that until you can get to that point.

Congrats, kmeeks. And I think you are not giving yourself enough credit. Iowa isn't exactly a model of health, from the people to the food available. It's very difficult when you're surrounded by the bad food you want to avoid, even if it's just in the ginormous quantities of otherwise healthy food. Keep it up!

OK, I've posted here a couple of times before and received mixed advice (which I think I tried all of) regarding being in generally good shape, but being unable to burn off my remaining lower abdomen fat (spare tire), seemingly no matter what I try.Now don't get me wrong, I'm not projecting blame on the advice, or some mythical force working against me, or anything like that. I'm just either "Doing it wrong(TM)", or not "Doing the right things(TM)", and I'm trying to figure out which it is.So here's the deal, I got myself in moderate shape doing a mixture of P90X and Insanity through the summer of last year. I trimmed myself down to about 175lbs, still with about 15-18% body fat (mostly in my mid-section), and I think a good portion of that was altering my eating. For the better part of a year and a half, my general intention on any given day is to limit simple carbs to an absolute minimum. Taking in no more than 150g of complex carbs, attempting to take in about 1.5g of protein per lb of body weight (that one I struggle with daily), taking in roughly 60g of fats in a day, split evenly between saturated and unsaturated, drinking plenty of water, and... well that's about it.Last September, I started working out in the gym at work with an older co-worker (I'm now 30, he's 49) who has/had been a physical trainer for a good portion of his life and is still in tremendous shape for his age. He works out constantly, eats cleanly, stays active, and looks great. We struck a deal since he was looking for a lifting partner, that if I wasn't a scrub, could hang with him, and we meshed well, that we'd just work out together, no charge, no fuss. Thankfully that has been working out great, and short of unexpected absenses from work from either of us, or trips, we work out 4 to 5 days a week together (the missing day is usually if I play ice hockey on thursday nights, in which case I'll do lighter cardio that day).Our typical regimen, which is nothing out of the ordinary, follows the following schedule:M - Chest and BicepsT - LegsW - Back and TricepsT - "crazy cardio day", which is usually supersets of chins/elevated pushups/decline situps/power cleans/dead lifts - or if I have hockey, I'll shoot for like a 45 minutes/3.5 mile variable treadmill run.F - ShouldersWe don't tend to follow a strict set of workouts from week to week, but will fluctuate workouts to mix things up and keep fresh. So chest one week might be a mixture of incline bench press supersetted with standing straight bar curls, flat dumbbell press with hammer curls, incline flys and one-arm preacher dumbbell speed reps, etc. The next week we might do smith flat bench, incline dumbbell, mix up the straight bar with the EZ-curl, whatever. We also finish up each day (except leg day and if we do our crazy cardio routine) with our ab routine. That's variable as well, but it's usually something like 30 decline sit-ups holding a 10lb plate, immediately followed by 20 laying leg raisers, 20 crunches, 20 laying knee raisers (laying on your back with your legs at a 90 degree bend as if you're sitting in a chair is the starting position, pull legs up and straight until your ankles are in front of your eyes, accelerate legs back down, stopping them at the start position), 20 heels to heaven, 30 laying toe touches (legs straight up in the air, reach up and touch your toes keeping your core tight throughout).The gist of it is we'll do similar muscle group workouts each week with slight variation in order and specifics at a times. We usually work out for about 45 minutes each day, but we don't BS, we don't take extended breaks. In fact we focus on pre-exhaustion on some days as only giving ourselves just enough recovery time to do the next set with a good number of reps. So our weight workouts actually wind up being pretty moderate cardio efforts, with dripping sweat and heavy breathing on every day.I also do my best to get in 3-4 cardio exercises in a week. This can be 3 or so miles on the treadmill, or doing an Insanity video (Pure cardio, Plyo Cardio Circuit being a couple of my favorites)So with the basics laid out, my physical history since we started has been pretty good. My strength has gone up consistently, with very few plateaus in the last 8 months and pretty solid muscle mass gains. In fact I'm physically larger (muscularly) in all parts of my body than I've ever been in my life, and plenty of people have taken notice. Yay, that's great and all, but what's eating me is that while my legs have almost no body fat, and my chest/upper back/arms very very little, my stomach is still a major fat deposit, as are my rear love handles (like right behind the point that your external obliques stick out) and central lower-back.My weight has also increased to an average of around 188lbs in that time, though I'm not concerned with weight nor am I unhappy with that fact since I have visibly less body fat at 188 now than I did at 175 on the way down. It's just that every single part of my body from my face to my ankles has visibly changed in dramatic ways in these 8 months, except for my lower abdomen! I mean other than one point where it dropped a couple of inches to where it is now, and I went from a 36" pant to mostly 34" pants, it flat out has not changed. I think my core strength is pretty damn good (we do all of our squats/leg exercises with full range/no belt and no injuries) and you can see my upper abs without issue. The mid/lower ones are just... obstructed.What's worse is that with the rest of my body changing for the better, my stomach staying the same actually makes me look _worse_ now in many ways with my shirt off than it did when I was just... soft. I mean it looked bad then too, but everything did, so it just blended in with the rest of the nasty.What the hell can I do? I'm at my wit's end with this, and though I've no intention to quit, I feel like after 8 months of pretty focused and serious training that I should see something change for the better in that area AmigaPhreak

Taking in a few hundred fewer calories is much, much simpler to accomplish than burning it.Working out tends to make the areas you're working bigger, not smaller. Also, the muscles you work out doing crunches are not the same muscles that are going to pull your gut in.

I appreciate the replies, and I probably set myself up for what you said based on my tangential whining about my gut and what I do to work out. I actually didn't intend to focus so much on what I do for my abs, that was much more a "oh! I'm listing what I do and I forgot to mention ab workouts", than it was, "I work my abs out like crazy and I still have a gut! Waaaah!".I'm very aware, and have been for the better part of a decade, that positional weight-loss is a myth. In fact I preach it to my wife regularly because she has very specific weight gain, and her past habits keep telling her to work those areas out. I'm also aware that working out makes things bigger, that's kind of the plan, in fact I'm not really worried that I'm about to develop my core muscles into a balloon belly, though, so I haven't sweated that fact.I want to have a muscular (but not ballooned, just fit) physique, and I feel like I'm on my way to succeeding at that from a diet/muscular level. I just have this one, completely disproportional area of fat that I'd like to impact more.On the subject of diet, as much as I mentioned the type of stuff I eat, I didn't mention the amount. Based on my calculations/research, at my age/height/weight/activity level, I'm at ~2800 calories a day for pure maintenance (30, 6', 188lbs, 5 day a week workout (with some twice a day)), and roughly 2400 calories for fat loss. Outside of a couple of recent trips where there were one or two bad days, I average between 2200-2500 calories a day, on top of the exercise, without getting wiped out.I also am not in a position where I can easily (read: without workout partner conflict and loss of current strength) switch from a lifting/cardio regimen to a pure fat burn workout. Like I said, even our lifting is done at a pace/intensity that basically makes it insanity with weights.Additionally, I'm averse to the "lose weight" title you both use. I mean yes, I know what you mean, but what we're both saying is that I need to lose body fat, not necessarily total body weight. I don't care if in the end I'm 10lbs heavier than I am now, as long as it's lean muscle. A number on a scale means little to me. I also don't need this to be done by next week, so if I gain 1 lb of lean muscle in 2 weeks, and lose 1 lb of fat in 2 weeks, and stay the same overall weight, I'm completely happy with that.So I guess to refine my request. What can I do to better add to/improve my fat loss while continuing to do my normal strength routine, and not go catabolic and lose muscle mass/strength (at least to any significant degree, and not too long term).

You can't do both at once. Hence the "bulk" and "cut" phases (I believe that is the correct terminology).Personally, I would just say that you should cut calories, not worry about "pure fat burning" or whatever. If you stop gaining muscle mass...oh well. Your body fat will go down if you burn more calories than you eat. Worry about muscle when you are at your target body fat percentage.

your carbs are still high, low carb is like 30g-50g a day. abs are made in the kitchen. its all diet. the fat on the stomach is a genetic guy thing, so its the last to go, it just takes time.2800 calories for maintenance? 2400 for fatloss? I'd be shooting for 1800 or something.also, doing cardio, isnt going to really help you loose weight unless your doing some ultra marathoning or cycling 100 miles a day, the cardio wont help much at all for weight loss.

I'd be shooting for 1800 or something.also, doing cardio, isnt going to really help you loose weight unless your doing some ultra marathoning or cycling 100 miles a day, the cardio wont help much at all for weight loss.I was doing a 20-40g total carb a day average for some time, but saw very little actual benefit from it. Also, when I mention up to 100g carbs a day, that's practically all complex carbs with a pretty decent amount of fiber mixed in as well. So a couple pieces of fruit (usually banana's and cherries, with an occasional orange), and mostly vegetables or nuts account for the rest.On the cardio front, I don't just do it for fat loss, I do it for fitness primarily. I like to keep active and have some endurance, the potential benefit to fat-loss is just a perk. Also, most of the insanity videos I choose to do on my own time would average to about 325 calories burned in a 45 minute video. That's not a small amount to just dismiss when factoring these. I mean if it would be between taking in 1800 calories a day without cardio, or taking in 2125 calories and doing the video, I'd choose the latter (obviously taking in 1800 calories and doing the video is also an option, not dismissing that).I guess my question is... what is "takes time". Having your stomach not change in size in 8 straight months of consistent training and controlled eating is... well frustrating. I'm not saying I should have a washboard stomach by now, but something would be nice.I guess I'll give a shot to further cutting my caloric intake and see what that gets me. I just don't agree directly with the "cut calories will cut weight" because the body isn't a simple machine. I can cut calories and my body can choose to canibalize muscle for energy while leaving the fat reserves, and all that does is set me back further.

Do you think sticking with it will give you different results in the future?".If you want to make sure you burn fat, cut your calories and avoid easily digestable carbs. You should be trying to keep your blood sugar as steady as possible.This means leaving out some fruits, rice, potatoes, breads, etc. Shakes and protein bars are another source of loads of easily digestible carbs. Good for energy, bad for blood sugar.You can try searching for "low glycemic index" on Google. Might be something different to try, if you are frustrated with your current results.

This helps keep your blood sugar and insulin levels down, since if it gets too high it signals your body to store glucose. When the levels are low, it's a signal to your body that it's time to burn fat. The idea jives with the science, and in practice has worked out pretty well for me, even when I am eating complete shit....and it looks like as I was writing this AmigaPhreak posted the other ways to manage it.

Good for energy, bad for blood sugar.You can try searching for "low glycemic index" on Google. Might be something different to try, if you are frustrated with your current results.I wouldn't say I'm resistant to it, just that I hope it doesn't actually turn out worse than my current problem On GI impact, I actually am not a fan of just using the GI index of foods. Reason being, well, it's probably easier to read it if you're not familiar. Basically GI doesn't take into account the carbohydrate content of the food by weight, so in some cases it mislabels something as bad for glycemic impact that aren't, like carrots. Most of the figures stay around the same for most foods though, so either is a good general metric.The only protein shake I use has 30g of protein in 11fl oz, and has 160 calories and 5g carbs (with 3g fiber, only 1g sugar). I get it for that very reason... well that and it actually tastes pretty damn good. My other protein intake is from salmon and lean chicken/turkey breasts, primarily.dferrantino, I realize that my body cannibilizing muscle is toxic, but that doesn't mean it won't do it. There's plenty of research I've read which seems to indicate it can be pretty easy to go catabolic, either through cutting intake too much or over training. People who are just interested in losing body fat without maintaining or improving their lean muscle mass don't really have much of a concern with that, and is why you see those girls and guys who starve themselves that are, what I call, "soft skinny". Their measurements are within the range that they want, but they're just... squishy.I'll start trying to slow my eating more as well, thanks for that. I am a notoriously fast eater... well, when I'm not jabbering, then I'm the last to finish.Mental note: talk more when eating Pysgard

That's mostly due to my significant twitching (i.e. jumping off the bed) and talking in my sleep, at times. However I always feel rested and don't wake up for just about anything without significant effort. It's really one of the only things in life I've been consistently good at As far as time goes, outside of times like now (Diablo III release), I average somewhere around 7.5 to 8 hours a night (~11 to 11:30 pm sleep start, ~7am sleep end).

Officially down 10 inches as of yesterday (44 pants to a 34) and I had the first day of my adult life under 200 this am (198.4) 3.4 more lbs before I can say I've lost a 100 lbs I can't tell whether playing like a child for 3 weeks straight (Peter Pan) or crossfit helped me get through this plateau, but I'm not complaining ronelson

After several weeks of being lazy and stupid I'm back on the horse: back to the gym and paying more attention to my diet. A friend of mine has turned me on to the Leangains program. Does anyone else here have any experience with intermittent fasting and/or Leangains? The client photos are pretty impressive and his work is pretty solidly backed up with scientific research. I just finished my first fasted cycle, and it wasn't nearly as hard as I thought it might be. I've picked up about 2-3lbs since April, but I'm hoping I can knock that out quick and work on getting below 180lbs this summer.

I am now three days back on the horse myself. As usual, I have no idea what my top weight currently is, and have no way to easily track it without buying a premium scale. Which is fine, I assume I am around 360ish because it takes considerable pressing down on the sink to level out at 340 (top weight on my scale).One comment about anyone wishing to purchase the Four Hour Body book - all of the diet information is pretty much word for word found on the blog. There is also no real 'structure' to the diet, and the author feels that measuring things is 'too much work'. Which is fine for him, but I like the structure. What is interesting is that except for rice, that diet is pretty much the exact same diet that I put myself on eight years ago to lose nearly 100lbs.Combine that with some new lentil recipes that I have been using, and the diet is extremely easy to get used to. That is when compared to other 'low carb' diets where I was basically trying to eat calories through greens or other low-calorie vegetables. I am quite curious to see where this goes.

I eat the same number of calories (1860) every day between 2PM and 10PM. It's harder to overeat when I'm only eating twice / day. I'm down 48lbs in the last 10 months. I've tried keto, paleo, WW points, calorie restriction, calorie restriction with IF, and eating around maintenance while lifting heavy. Everything worked (other than eating maintenance, should have seen that coming) it just was a matter of how long I could tolerate it. What works best for me is no food restrictions, just limiting calories. I've been pretty regular about exercise. I'm 2 weeks from finishing C25K. LoseIt just sent me an email noting that I've logged exercise at least 3 times a week for 8 weeks.

I think the benefit of fasting is that it re-sensitizes your body to blood sugar. If you eat all the time, your blood sugar stays at elevated levels and any drops to what would be normal levels tell your brain you need to eat. Especially if you eat alot of carbs (which makes your blood sugar swing around more than fats or proteins).When you have a 12-16 hour fast, a lower blood sugar becomes your new "normal". So meals become more satisfying and you don't get as hungry in between.Just make sure to drink enough water.

Anybody have advice for the easiest way to measure body fat at home? I'm thinking of getting one of those scales that measure body fat but I'm not sure how reliable they are.Right now I've just been using the method where you measure your waist and neck. For a while it was a useful, if inaccurate, metric. But since my weight loss has slowed down and I've started to bulk up my waist isn't really shrinking anymore. I can tell I'm still losing fat, but it would be nice to be able to have some real data to analyze rather than just looking at myself in the mirror. I guess I could take pictures of myself as a cheap solution.

I have plastic calipers I got off amazon. My understanding is the scales are very dependant on how much water you have been drinking to send the waves through your body, as well as your temperature. Last time I used one, I had to change it from regular to athlete to get a good reading on my mother in laws scale, so right there its fudging the numbers somehow.

I've been really struggling with motivation lately. I trained hard and was very strict on my diet for months but the past two months I've been getting in the gym even just once a week. I know I've shot my diet to hell and back. I've started the Leangains routine and am trying to pick my meals more carefully now, but I'm still having a lot of difficulty finding any motivation to get back in the gym. I'm going to start running again today, which is likely to be brutal since I cheated with a few cigarettes the past couple weeks. I'm just very frustrated with my complete lack of motivation. I was down to about 182 and getting ready to bust through the 180lb mark, and this morning I was back up to 187. How do you guys stay motivated?

Yea that, and just having the goal in mind. That being said the last 10 days have been really shitty food wise, although I attribute it to moving and having friends in town. Next week is back on the horse for sure.

I'm down to a size L shirt (from XXL at my heaviest).I'm down to size 38 pants (from 50s at my heaviest).My weight is bouncing around in the mid-220s.Shooting for 199. If I can just get down to a weight that starts with a "1" I'll be happy for the time being.

You can do it Norrick! I just touched on 198 before bouncing back up but I'm hoping for a solid two weeks to get that average under the line.
