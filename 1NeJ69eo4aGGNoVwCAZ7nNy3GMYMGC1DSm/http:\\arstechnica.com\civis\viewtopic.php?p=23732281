Isn't it time to stop reporting on stuff Steve Jobs may or may not have done, is accused of doing or is supposedly totally awesome for? Unless it directly relates to Apple today, let the guy rest in peace already.

No, because this stuff is interesting and people like reading about it.I propose that Ars display a hit counter on stories. Maybe if it's transparent which topics draw the most interest we can finally do away with comments like these.(Just the other day I was reading about a letter from the 50s that a 12-year old kid wrote asking Frank Lloyd Wright to design a doghouse for his dog Eddie. Surprisingly, Lloyd Wright actually drew up a plan for a super cool doghouse. Just because a guy is dead sure doesn't mean it's not worth finding out more about him.)

Pretty appropriate that Ars would report on it

Please explain where the saving of the several hundreds of thousands (oddly small?) of dollars comes in.

I'm not sure how this penchant for candidness and honesty squares with the revelation yesterday that Jobs was willing to engage in abusive patent litigation as a response to employee poaching.It seems to me that the more information that comes to light about his private life the more good and bad that we will see. Hopefully the next generation of creative leaders will learn from both sides of that coin.[edited to expand on the initial thought]

Basically, if you don't like the subject or the people involved, don't read the article. If you have an issue with the writing style or editorial decisions of Ars, bring it up with them, but don't try and say that a given person is now off limits to talk about because they're dead and by implication of no more interest to anyone.

Just because a story generates a lot of comments doesn't mean the comments are always just two sides fighting. That sometimes happens (perhaps unfortunately), but often the topic merely engendered spirited debate, or sharing of relevant personal anecdotes, etc.

I've been reading Ars for over a decade, but I have yet to come across the option where Ars takes over your browser and forces you to read articles you don't care about.A little help activating it? Maybe I need to clear my cookies.

The best way to gauge interest in a story is to check what percentage of comments are not related to gauging interest in the story, or alternatively, how many comments are of the form: "If you don't like <this topic>, don't read the article!".

Hopefully the next generation of creative leaders will learn from both sides of that coin.[edited to expand on the initial thought]I think the honesty here isn't at odds with that particular revelation at all. Jobs "honestly" didn't want Palm poaching Apple employees, and he was "honest" when he said that he would go to great lengths to prevent Palm from doing that. Now, you may find his threat unethical (I'm not really arguing either way), so you might be assuming that contrasts with Jobs' honesty as an "ethical" behavior.But if you look at it more from Jobs' view, Palm was doing something "not cool," so he threatened to retaliate with something that was even more "not cool." That's pretty much classic Jobs right there.

Slow news week indeed. Not particular interested in reading all about Job's life, but this was at least an interesting anecdote.

Pixar has been Disney's cash cow for a long time. On occasion Disney makes something truly worthy (Wreck-It Ralph comes to mind- excellent movie), but I'd say that yes, most of their films of the past 2 decades have been awful.

WTF? A claim about saving "several hundred thousand dollars" on a $7 billion deal is a joke, full stop. That's smaller than a rounding error. We're talking mathematical epsilon levels of relative insignificance.

It just doesn't read well since non CEOs aren't going to hear "saved several hundred thousand dollars" in the full context where it means "nothing important".

Quote:Disney CEO went to Steve Jobs to find out if Disney films “sucked”Exactly what part of this article supports the headline above? It sounds more Iger called Jobs to talk, and Jobs shared his opinion on Disney films. Wouldn't be out-of-character for the guy.

It's slightly confusing, because it seems Ars' headline writer doesn't seem to understand that Iger was being sarcastic, so I think people are actually going to come into the article thinking that Iger and Disney really, somehow, saved themselves several hundred thousand dollars on a 7 billion dollar deal.

I believe Disney movies have improved noticeably since Pixar took over. Princess and the frog and tangled are two examples of Disney that were well above the quality seen before. Meet the Robinsons was one if the earlier movies delayed because Pixar rewrote slabs of the movie (which helped a little)...But if he had asked "does Disney suck", all you'd have to do is point to the article "the mouse that ate the public domain" - a great read and a candid piece in the mass destruction caused by that little mouse - you'll never see Mickey the same light again...http://writ.news.findlaw.com/commentary ... igman.html

In the third last paragraph, you used both CEO's (incorrect because no additional abbreviation occurs aside from what the acronym already indicates) and CEOs (correct).

They couldn't afford his usual rates, nor could they afford to outfit the home with all the furniture and other accoutrements Wright created as part of the design. Wright did all the design work for a budget they could afford, in exchange for a promise that they would have it built and furnished as Wright had envisioned.http://www.samara-house.org/welcome.htm
