Having been very out of shape for decades, although I have never been very heavy, I can sympathize with needing to ease into exercise. I was so fucking proud the first time I ran a mile without stopping to walk. Take it slowly, but make it a part of your life. I have to regroup again, and start P90X over again because of my ankle, but with the weather being better, I may just use the time to go running and do the 8 Min routines with dumbbells and ankle weights instead, just for a change. In the meantime, I put on almost eight pounds because I was still eating the same diet. I'm not worried about it though. It'll come off again.

Not gonna lie, very demotivated today. 3lbs is nothing. Quit freaking out over nothing and stay the course. Yesterday I weighted the same when I woke up and went to sleep. Today I weighted 3 lbs less when I woke up. For me, that's a shift of 1.7% of body weight in one night. I have no explanation, I ate at maintenance yesterday, it's just noise. Your body weight can easily swing inside a 5 lb range throughout the day. Think about how many measurements you would have to take to identify the .17 lbs / day loss your current *estimated* 600 cal deficit should get you. Oh, did I mention your scale claims an error of .2 lbs?

I've had issues with my knees, hips, IT band, and ankles yet some folks just put on shoes and go running with no plan or training and have no issues whatsoever. I'm still working on getting to running a mile without a break. I might be able to do it now, but I'm forcing myself to stick to the C25K program lest I end up with yet another injury. I will be fucking proud when I can run a mile without stopping, because hopefully it will mean I have conquered the myriad of depressing injuries.

Age 30 male weight 155 height 5'9".Hitting the border of normal bmi as a wake up call, the idea is to increase my exercise and return to my usual weight of 135 ish. Well aiming at 140s as I want some fat on me. Causes of weight gain: cake and sweets binging at work. I work high intensity job where after an hour I feel numb an dizzy from brain glucose low. For two months I've not had a pool to swim out of and have reduced both frequency and intensity of activity. No more. I bike every day to work 4.2mi for 25+min one way. Got gym membership so I can swim my usual 2k a day. Get up and stretch more in the office. 1week in a statistically insignificant 2lb reduction. I feel better though. Muscle aches oh how I've missed thee.

Ok, minor freakout averted. Thinking about it more, I'm pretty sure that it was from the PF Chang's I got and had for lunch for two days. While the calories in one serving were fine, the sodium was through the roof so I'm sure I was retaining water. I'm now sitting pretty at -7 pounds lost the last month. I'm also juuuuust slightly back in the green on Subtract the Fat from my last weight lost push in July. And yes, I know I was freaking out over probably nothing, but when your doctor looks you in the eye and seriously suggests getting lap band surgery, the stakes for not losing weight are just slightly higher. She's scared me straight.

Think about how many measurements you would have to take to identify the .17 lbs / day loss your current *estimated* 600 cal deficit should get you. Oh, did I mention your scale claims an error of .2 lbs?I find that what helps me is using one of those online weight tracking tools. Their graphs clearly show you when an unexpected weight gain or loss doesn't really count towards your running average.I also need to lose about 100+ lbs. A couple of months ago I decided to try to lose weight (yet again), but this time (yet again) I think it'll stick. I know everyone's motivations and methods are different, but here are mine:1. I hit 264.8 lbs. at the beginning of February, and 265 lbs. is my "ZOMG I'm way too fat" weight.2. In the beginning of March I really wanted to buy a particular camera lens, and I realized I couldn't afford it just because I was spending way too much money on eating out everyday.3. Lent had just started, and I didn't know what to give up. Fast food seemed like a good idea.4. My wife had lost 50+ lbs. over the last year despite having a husband who was clearly not dieting with her.So the first thing I did was to stop going through the drive-thru everyday. It was tough for the first week, but after that it was fine. What really helped was that my wife and I were still going to my favorite (sit-down) restaurant every weekend. Looking forward to that throughout the week really helped keep my mind off of fast food. However, I started gaining weight (that peak on March 19 in the graph)! I decided to stop eating sweets (e.g. a Snickers bar) for my daily snacks and switched to bananas and apples. What really surprised me was that a banana could get rid of my hunger between meals. For some reason I thought I needed a hearty high-calorie snack, but the banana worked just fine. Then I started having more faith in the food I ate being able to satisfy me if I only gave it some time (instead of eating something horrible until I felt full).During this time I learned the difference between being hungry and having a craving. I realized I couldn't really handle sweets. If I ate just a doughnut my cravings came back. I find it much easier to resist the doughnut in the break room than to resist a craving for days. Some time this year I also made the switch to eating only whole grain bread and avoiding stuff with HFCS (e.g. like in BBQ sauce, jelly, bread, etc.).During my wife's weight loss she became a fan of intermittent fasting. She tried to get me to do it, but I thought she was crazy. If I didn't eat for a few hours I became cranky and felt like crap. However, a few weeks ago I accidentally skipped dinner and then accidentally skipped the breakfast after that. After realizing this I decided to skip lunch to try for a 24 hour fast, and it worked out great! The idea that I could go that long without food and not even feel it (i.e. no crappy feeling and still able to do some yard work) freaking blew my mind!The lowest I've weighed during my adult life was about 244 lbs. I weighed in at 248 lbs. this morning, and I'm really hoping to go past 244 lbs. by next month. Attachments

I just realized I didn't mention my methodology. I was sort of inspired by Dr. Fuhrman's diet. Counting calories is a pain, and it hasn't really worked for me in the past. Instead, I'm focusing on slowly and permanently giving up "bad calories", and I'm letting my body tell me when it's full.My intention is to never go to a McDonald's ever again. I simply can't handle it. However, I'm still eating potato chips. I love potato chips. I also intend to never eat a snickers bar again, but I'm still eating flour tortillas. I hope to eventually give up eating potato chips and flour tortillas, but for now I'm still going to enjoy them.Even if I manage to lose a bunch of weight my fear is I may end up just gaining it all back. My goal is to focus on my normal BMI diet (which should also help me get to my normal BMI) rather than focusing on a temporary diet.

Nice job! ^5I'd love to get to the point where my body will tell me when I'm full and when to stop eating, but at least for now it doesn't. I'm either ZOMGHUNGRY or UNCOMFORTABLY STUFFED, and I can still feel hungry immediately after eating dinner... unless I overeat and my stomach hurts. There's really no in-between, satisfied feeling, so I have to count calories so I know I'm eating the right amount.Now I'm going to go run without anyone prompting me to do it other than myself (THBMan usually reminds me but he's away). shots

They come in a bunch of different flavors and might give you the same satisfaction as eating potato chips. And I think they taste better than most chips anyway.Another thing that works for me is knowing meals at fast food places I can get that are healthy. A chicken breast footlong at subway without cheese and a light sauce is like 500 calories. A caesar salad at McD's with balsamic dressing is like 150 calories. Their little fruit/walnut things is like 200 calories. That way if you cave in and go for fast food you can still eat healthy.

Good point. I've been concerned about the inevitable point in the future when I'm visiting friends and they want to eat out. I'll try to remember those and come up with other ideas in case I find myself at a fast food joint.

I'm in no way defending the science or theory behind it, but Jack Kruse's Leptin Reset Rx worked where everything else failed for me. One of the primary effects is supposed to be regaining control over cravings. I only did it for two weeks and broke through a year long plateau. The diet boils down to this:1. Eat your first meal within 30 min of waking. Should be very low carb and 50g of protein.2. No exercise3. Eat three times a day, 6 hours apart, with zero snacking. Last meal should be 4-5 hours before bed.4. Eat according to a paleo diet. No grains, legumes, milk, vegetable oils, etc.,.1 and 2 are easy. 3 and 4 can be very difficult. Some people consider no snacking or eating before bed as crazy talk The majority consider paleo crazy. Notice calorie restriction or counting calories is not on that list, yet most people who do it loose weight. There is a huge thread about it over at the Marks Daily Apple forums. I mean 21,770 posts huge in only 10 months. For some reason it's mostly women posting about it even though that forum has lots of men.http://jackkruse.com/easy-start-guide/http://www.marksdailyapple.com/forum/thread32345.html

Mine also had a "minimum" of 5 hours between meals, last food at 9pm and crazy amount of water (5l/1.3 gallons a day). Was losing 1.5 kg/3.3 pounds a week that way without any excercise.

And at $7 for just about all their meals, it's only mildly more expensive than McDs or Wendy's. Panera's my other option, their greek salad is great and you can skip or skimp on the dressing to keep the calories down. At the very least, it is better than patties that have been in a warming bin or on the grille for hours and toppings that aren't exactly fresh and no bun to weigh it down, topped with fried potatoes.And it has only been said a million times, but DRINK MORE WATER! Most people seem to mistake thirst for hunger. Eating your bananas and other fruit also helps because unlike your Snickers, these foods have a high water content.

Burrito bowls are fantastic, healthwise. Even with the cheese and sour cream. Skip sour cream and get guac for tasty and nutritious fat content.

Most of their food tastes like it should be good for you, but even their basic salads and sandwiched are really high in calories.

There are other chains that are essentially the same as Chipotle's such as Moe's and Salsarita's, if anyone reading this doesn't have a Chipotle nearby. And I skip Chipotle's rice anyway. That lime crap is vile.If you have one nearby, I really love Roly Poly for a wrap that is both nutritious and tastes good.

Some of the sandwiches at Panera come close to 1,000 calories. And they sound perfectly healthy, so you'd never guess without checking first. When I'm in weightloss mode, 1000 calories is more than half of what I should be eating in a day. Just figured I'd give folks a heads up. katespace

I feel really good about my progress. I had my first 3 minute runs on Couch to 5k, and... they weren't that bad! I was shocked! For someone who has been sedentary for as long as I have, I feel like being able to run at sub-10-minute-mile speed for 3 minutes straight is a huge accomplishment. I'm a little nervous about next week's 4 and 6 minute runs though. I'm still doing it on the elliptical until I can get my weight down to ~240 or so because the elliptical is lower impact and I really don't want to have my Achilles's tendinitis flare up again and prevent me from exercising. Once I hit that mini-goal, I'll go out and hit the pavement. Also, once I get there, I'll be able to wear the jeans I fit into around my wedding ~3.5 years ago(!). I also moved into the next 10s place down weight-wise, so that feels pretty darn good. (Why yes, this is the polar opposite of last week's meltdown. )You can see where I started last July, where I started backsliding, and where I started up again at the end of March on my chart. Back in the green, and hoping to stay there for the foreseeable future. dferrantino

Should be done with family gatherings for the near future, so back to weight-loss mode. I've been good about maintaining through PAX, a birthday, and an engagement party, and was quite happy to see that the 5.5 pounds I gained Friday and Saturday were mostly gone when I weighed in this morning. Starting this week about where I left off before PAX, with a very ambitious goal in mind for the rest of it. It's also been very strange seeing my average finally meet up with my spot-weight.

Just figured I'd give folks a heads up. almost all the Panera sandwiches have lots of cheese and creamy or sweet sauce on them. if you pick off half the cheese you can probably save a good chunk of calories. i usually dissect my sandwiches to make them smaller and scrape any extra sauce off before i eat them or order a half sandwich, they do have that option.

gained 7lbs at my fraternity alumni weekend (that was weighing myself this AM, I didn't weigh myself fri sat or sun) Ugh. Really need to work hard the next few weeks, my goal of under 200 by the Vermont City Marathon (I'm in running in the relay) is totally doable, but I really need to focus. I did buy a jump rope to work on my cardio, I figure even if I don't want to 'work out' I can still do 15 minutes of weight lifting (some dumbbel squats and curls) and jump rope for 10 or 15 mintues to do SOMETHING every day..

Those red/green charts are great motivators - not sure I want to see one for me as whenever I am travelling and having fun its only gonna be red which would bum out the mojo. Anyway, committing here to get rid of 10 pounds in a month (did 2.3 pounds this past week). Should be doable; gonna need to keep on that eliptical for 40 minutes at least 5 times a week and cutting back on the red wine.Keep up the good work folks.

Quote:When I'm in weightloss mode, 1000 calories is more than half of what I should be eating in a day. Just figured I'd give folks a heads up. If you are in weightloss mode and you're eating the full sandwiches, you're doing it wrong. The half sandwich you get in a choose two is its own damn meal. I think it's actually a pretty good deal considering you get two meals at about the same price as a single meal elsewhere, myself.Then again I also stick with the greek salad (190 cals, up to 10 more *if* you use all the dressing) and the tom/moz panini (380) in a choose two, so even if I go all in it's not too bad. What you really have to watch out for are the baguettes, 150 cals each and at least around here they'll toss an extra one or two in.Quote:"Not the best from a caloric intake" to me implies that there are maybe a couple hundred extra calories.Extra compared to what? I was going by fast food, for example McDs. Big Mac, 550, Large fries, 500. That's over the calories in your panera to start with, a lot less filling... but it's cheaper. The $ to calorie ratio at Panera is much better than just about any fast food joint. They make it far too easy to blow up your waistband on the cheap.

Turbo2Takes me 2-3 weeks to put on 10 BUT I find but takes me 3-4 to take those 10 back off ; well, I guess if I got serious and took out anything nice to eat on the weekends and basically did no booze I could probably do it in 2. 2 weeks of a miserable life though! Into everyone's life some wine and steaks and pizzas and burrata must fall else why bother being here.

At least for me, I can quickly put it on and take it off when it comes to 5-10 lb. swings just because so much of the weight gain/loss on that small of a scale is just all the extra waste in your body that comes with eating larger, unhealthy meals.

Into everyone's life some wine and steaks and pizzas and burrata must fall else why bother being here.In the past when I've done a Cyclical Ketogenic Diet I pretty much swung 5-10 lbs every weekend. Zero carbs all week, then carb load for 24 hours, back to zero. The water weight gain and loss is something I always find interesting.For "real" loss, fat loss, it definitely takes me longer. 2 or 2.5 lbs a week is about the best I can do when I'm serious.

I think it's really just a case of "to each his own."Most people don't realize that the calorie counts at Panera are so high. I was just trying to be helpful. If you like the food and you can eat it and keep within your calorie reqs, more power to you. 12980 posts â€¢ Previous 1 ... 274275276 ... 325 Next
