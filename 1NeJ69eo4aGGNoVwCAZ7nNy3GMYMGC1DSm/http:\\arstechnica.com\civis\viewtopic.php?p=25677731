The political shield barrier against net neutrality seems to be defeated by renaming it to something different, apparently!

About bloody time a sensible bill on network control came down in Congress.

If Congress can't get enough of its shit together to ensure good-quality Netflix connections for all, then democracy is over. Consumer interests are a nullity. We should kill all the prisoners and leave the continent by canoe, each of us going our separate ways.

This sounds like an awesome bill. Which means it's more likely to waste away and die in Congress.

I worry about the wording of the bill being so video distribution focused; the points and provisions made are sensible, but tailoring the bill to video traffic specifically simply opens the door for the same kind of behaviour on a different kind of traffic down the road (audio, streamed web applications, etc...) - why not just make the bill target generic content?

Maybe I'm wrong but this is one of those issues I don't worry all that much about. There are a lot of things in need of regulation and protection and I would certainly support this bill but I feel this is one of those few times when "free market capitalism" will actually work well to protect the consumer. If you start enforcing hard data caps on me or choking my video streaming I'm going to switch ISPs and I really believe that smaller ISPs (or not so small ones) will jump at the chance to steal a huge section of someone's customer base by offering "no caps" or guaranteeing "no throttling". Of course I expected something similar to happen with the ridiculous texting charges too and it is but it took a hell of a lot longer than I thought it would. On second thought, yeah lets pass some laws.Edit: So apparently this is basically just reddit now eh? Someone posts a story and if someone has an opinion you don't like you just destroy them with downvotes. You know I wasn't rude, insulting, or in any other way inappropriate. I expressed a line of thought that you may not agree with (or may think is failing to take other factors into consideration) and that used to be fine on Ars, people would respond and you'd talk about it, I guess that isn't how we're going to do things any more. Maybe I should just start thinking of witty one liners and try to get them in early enough to gather some yummy upvotes.My thanks to those who replied to me pointing out some of the flaws in my line of thought and educating me on other situations.

Legal video as defined by the RIAA/MPAA would be covered, but if they wanted to throttle your torrent traffic, even on only suspicion you might be pirating videos, they could and not break the law. It also doesn't cover other legitimate uses for large data transfers either.They need to treat the entire internet as a fat dumb pipe, open up the last mile to real competition, and be done with it. There is too much of a conflict of interest in media holding companies also being ISPs.

Tie it to something like Netflix, which most people enjoy, and now you've got a lot more support.

I like Net Neutrality (at least in the all to common markets with out competition), but how will this be policed? I don't like the idea of the FCC monitoring all ISPs to ensure compliance. Otherwise, there is a lot to like here.

I have seen YouTube and Netflix both throttled with my home connection. It's particularly frustrating because if I connect to a VPN my internet overall gets a bit slower (and CPU load increases) but suddenly and seemingly magically YouTube and Netflix both load more videos more consistently. It's ridiculous that it's legal for cable providers to throttle their competitors.

You'd think that, but you'd be wrong. Even ignoring the massive collusion that has taken place between the larger ISPs, the fact of the matter remains that it is insanely expensive to lay new wires down, thus making it less attractive for someone else to step in.

The bill looks like it would protect services like Aereo, and (if I read the article correctly) appears to make other rebroadcast legal.

Because that's what we have right now with "self policing" by companies who have vested interests in anticompetitive behavior and captive markets with near-monopolies.You, the consumer, are the chicken. And you look delicious. If you trust Comcast, Time Warner, Verizon, or any other to act in your best interests, instead of their own self interest, you only need to look at the historical record to see evidence to the contrary.

Considering I can VPN in to school and get better youtube service than through direct Fios, I think its time to do something. This bill however, doesn't seem like it can solve the CDN negotiation issue.

One thing I found interesting was the requirement that the FCC approve the methods used to measure usage based billing. Does anyone else think that if it became to cost prohibitive to meet the requirements that it could lead to companies completely abandoning such practices and going completely unlimited? I could see this happening. I like this bill, but since it has too much common sense I'm sure the lobbyists are already in full force buying off our congressmen.

Senators writing consumer focused bills. Excellent. Of course that is why it will never pass what with the government run by big business buying votes.

Of course, neither is as good at the lobbying game as the Comcasts, Verizons, and AT&Ts of the industry - they have years of greasing palms behind them. But there are business interests who are for this stuff (aside from the obvious disruptive little startups like Aereo, of course.)

On second thought, yeah lets pass some laws.I agree with you entirely except on one point. The markets aren't competitive in many regions. Many people have only one option for decent high speed internet. The cost for entry into the market is high and many forces, not the least of which is government, create further barriers. I don't like government telling ISPs what to do with their networks, but if they are going to use their monopoly to stifle competition, regulations may be needed.

I can't wait till all the ISP Gaming Packages which allow access to Steam, Xbox Live and PSN. Or music packages for Spotify or iTunes.Choosing bits and pieces of net neutrality are dumb. Who knows what's going to exist in the future that won't be covered. We need to have laws for the whole thing.

This bill sounds like a great idea, but it doesn't have a chance of passing. Republicans are vehemently opposed to anything approaching Net Neutrality, and this is squarely in that vein. They believe that, if you want to compete, you should provide a better product that everyone wants or build your own network. The problem with that is how the government has, essentially, given cable companies practical monopolies in their various areas for decades now. Only now are real options for networks popping up, and even those aren't terribly good in some areas. To build your own network would not only be prohibitively expensive, but the current providers already have a leg up that would allow them to out-compete any start-ups. That's why Verizon FIOS, municipal fiber, and city-wide WiFi are so important. Unfortunately, Verizon quit expanding FIOS and the other two are growing only slowly.

Argh, more dancing around the issue. Hey, let's pass a zillion bills that enact net-neutrality piece-by-piece, with lots of omissions and loopholes, creating a complex tapestry of regulation, instead of... just freaking passing a net-neutrality bill. Better than nothing, but I'd rather have a comprehensive law that mandates that ISPs be dumb pipes, rather than a regulatory nightmare that requires an ever-larger population of lawyers to understand.edited: typos

Some videos on Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, whatever, are specifically licensed to play on a computer but not a TV. Amazon is contractually required to block those videos if they know you're using a television to watch them, as in the case of a Chromecast.How a television is any different from a monitor, I have no fucking idea. But that's how the contracts are. If you ran an HDMI cable from your PC to your TV, you could watch just fine because it counts as watching via your computer, but stream via Chromecast and the same screen becomes a television.
