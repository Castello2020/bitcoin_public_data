Is the video processor in the S3 the same in the Note 2?

Both you guys ordering the Note 2.I strongly recommend you order the invisi-shield from Zagg right away.Specifically this onehttp://www.zagg.com/invisibleshield/sam ... hields.phpJust get the screen cover. I didn't remove my tmob plastic wrap on the screen while I was waiting for the above to ship.That screen huge & 1 nick or drop or scratch while in pocket & you will really regret not having a protective cover on the frontTurn phone off, battery out, spray the front with the water based sol & apply the screen & squeegee out the water & walk away for an hour or so till it dries outYou will get a perfect bubble free installfor security I used avast! from the play.google.com shop & its free.The other one (also free) is LBE Privacy Guard but you need to root your phone for thatAllows detailed settings per appEnjoy your new phone Pysgard

I never liked those shields. I don't like how they are tacky, how you can hook them with your nail. I like the clear smooth ones from MonoPrice. Undetectable, under a buck.

Isn't it Gorilla glass or somesuch?As far as screen protectors go, the only ones I like are Moshi iVisor series - easy to put on and guaranteed bubble free (because they only adhere to the sides of the phone/tablet, leaving a layer of air between the protector and the screen).http://www.amazon.com/Moshi-Protection- ... axy+note+2There is one for Galaxy Note so I will maybe get one for Note 2 but I hope that I won't have to.

I'd advise against any of the Zagg, BodyGuardz, BestSkinsEver... style screen protectors for the Note 2. If you use the stylus it will leave marks in the protector as they are much softer than the Spigen style ones.

ETA 11/9 per FedExOddly enough, I'm more excited about this than I was the iPhone 5. Every since I got a new MacBook, I've been using it more and my phone less. Now it's just occasional email, text, web and phone calls. I'm really excited to see how it is on a much larger screen.The non-app GV integration will also be very welcome.

Has anyone seen one in person yet? Is the AMOLED stripe change noticeable? I despise PenTile displays, but Anandtech made it sound like the new arrangement improved it substantially.

The protector doesn't tear it just leaves an indentation from the stylus tip. Check out the XDA forum for other reports.

Looks like I'm due for delivery tomorrow. I can't wait. I'm even more excited than I was for my One X!The Anandtech review talks about a Samsung cover that flips. Anyone know where to get it or what it's called?Quote:The Note 2 likewise comes with a lineup of flip covers that replace the battery door completely and have a soft lint-free felt material that cleans and protects the display, and a pleather top side. I grew accustomed to using Galaxy S 3 this way, and seeing it continue to the Note 2 is definitely welcome. Samsung gets the value of having a consolidated accessory lineup, and the Note 2 continues that by making the flip covers compatible with all the Note 2s the same way the flip covers were interchangeable between international and USA variants of the Galaxy S 3.edit: found them on Amazon http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_ ... over+note+

So you didn't have any attitude in your first reply, because it sounded like you did. If not, then I apologize for the big misunderstanding, but...you chose the insult path with your unnecessarily mad reply:Quote:I don't keep my keys and my phone in the same pocket. So I really have no idea. But you seem pretty determined to prove you're an amazing fiscal economic genius by buying a cheap screen protector instead of a nice one.

Get a room you two. Also, mine is at the local sort facility....I wait. Fedex is usually here before noon, so hopefully very soon. I'm going to leave the glass naked and apply the Zagg style coating to sides and back, and possibly corners of glass. My iPhone has 0 scratches from 2.5 years of having its own pocket and only accidentally cohabitating with keys a few times.

B00772FX9W), the keys will scratch the protector. I do like the feel of it though, works great for both touch and while using the stylus.

Pretty slow going relative to the KeyboardWith my Note I find the stylus useful mainly for free form notes and for annotating pictures or screenshots. Any other text input I do is easier with the soft keyboard. I'm not very artistic so I don't use it for drawing but I have seen some fairly nice sketches done by Note owners.

So on the iPad there's an app called Notability. You make notes with a pen or finger, drawings, whatever, and it sync directly with DropBox in PDF format. Then you can view them anywhere and have them backed up. Is there an equivalent I can use for the Note 2? Making notes that I can't pull up instantly on any of my other devices is useless to me.

An acquaintance of mine has a Note 2 and the hardware is fantastic to hold. I'd love one. But the cheapest I've found it is $729 and the bootloader is locked so I can't rid of Samsung's bullshit build of Android. Pass.
