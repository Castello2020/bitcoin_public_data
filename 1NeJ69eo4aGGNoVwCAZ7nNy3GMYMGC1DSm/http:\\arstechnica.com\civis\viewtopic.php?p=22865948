The Celeron 300A and BeOS coverage drew me in. When I got over my fear of the DoD threads I signed up, then subscribed when that became necessary.

I think I was directed here from from Perl-centric place, I spent a lot of time in the Tech forums reading stuff.My first venture to write in Ars was a 'how to' bypass administrative lockdown of Windows XP CMD prompt; that didn't generate much other than contempt for trying to bypass administrative lockdowns, even though I thought it was a neat hack, at the time.(it's still a neat hack, I still use it a decade or more later).I stayed on for the GESC forum. I subscribed, eventually, so that I could join in the IBTL, PC++, and quote-towers of doom Lounge shenanigans.Never did quite fit in with 'the crowd' though My Ars usage these days is ************* Lounge******** GESC** Observatory** Tech forums content.* Main-Page Articles linked from the clickies at the bottom of threads.

It was a long time ago, but I'm pretty sure I got here via a search for hardware reviews and reading some of Hannibal's stuff, which then led me to lurking the forums (which I did for a loooong time before signing up).

Reformed slashdotter (not to be confused with a notdottir), here. Lurked around a bit, found people smarter than me, wasn't sure I like the feeling, lurked some more. Created an account several years later. 99% of posts in the Lounge and 99% noise.

Sadly, I couldn't afford one given that I had a perfectly good computer. Apparently it was also the last good Compaq ever manufactured. Started out as an AMD K6-2 400 MHz, 64 MB of SDR-100, onboard ATI Rage video chip with 4 MB of video RAM, 8 GB Bigfoot hard drive. By the time I stopped using it four years later, it had 192 MB of RAM, another 15 GB hard drive in there, a Voodoo 3 2000 PCI video card, and a K6-2+ overclocked to 550 MHz.That computer ran beautifully and handled everything I threw at it for a long, long time. Was very happy with it, but eventually it got long in the tooth.(Edit: Also, I'm somewhat alarmed at how well I can remember in detail the specs for a computer I stopped using ten years ago.)

I did a search on the DDR vs Rambus memory to settle an argument some coworkers were having. I found the article here, but my coworkers didn't take much notice.I think I read a couple of the overclocking articles and posted a couple questions about a Diamond Rio mp3 player. 9/11 happened and I posted a couple times in the threads that were opened up to everyone.Then, I pretty much ignored Ars for about a year until I had an honest IT job and started reading the Lounge before I subbed. And damn, did I post whore a lot after I subbed.

I started reading articles here in 2009 when I was doing research to build my own PC, and registered as Techweasel to comment on articles and whatnot.In 2010 I wanted to change my name, so I subscribed for a month, then Aurich nuked me by mistake ( ) and comp'd me a year as an apology. I haven't let my sub lapse since then. You fools are addicting. The Boardroom has saved me from at least one career-limiting move, and the VR and Lounge are just plain fun to read and participate in.

I had a friend who got completely suckered into buying a Dell with a 1.4 GHz Pentium 4 and 256 MB of Rambus memory. The salesperson fed him the most preposterous line of bull about the faster processor and new memory type and he didn't know any better at all. I think the memory alone cost him $800 at the time. It was only after he'd placed the order that he mentioned it to me and I told him that he was buying a piece of crap covered in gold spray paint. He was incredulous, but I pulled up the relevant reviews of processors and memory and showed them to him. Then he was appalled, but I think it hadn't shipped yet and so he was able to cancel the purchase.

In 2000 (or possibly late 1999), I was searching for info about dual CPU motherboards & came across a review here - after that I kept coming back, but it was still a while after that before I discovered the forums.

You know it was back in September of 1999. I was just starting Grade 10 in High School, taking my second year of Communications and Technology classes (which consisted of photoshop, 3D Studio, Flash animation, etc) and Computer Programming II, which consisted of Turing .I've always been into computers, its the first hobby my parents showed me that I really sunk my teeth into. But I can't honestly remember how I found Ars. It must've been a link randomly out of yahoo search, or off an anandtech or something that I read back in the day.Unfortunately my email archives don't go back that far anymore (only to 2003) and due to some stupidity a few years ago I lost a bulk of data from my school days (fail).Either way I've been here reading, and posting all way through high school, college, retail jobs, government jobs, private sector jobs, etc. I've aged 13 years from 16 to 28. I've grown a beard, adding 13" to my hair, changed girlfriends 6 times. Gone from a 24" TV to a 84" projection and 46" Plasma. From a 486 and a PIII 450 to a 8-Core Mac Pro. From 128MB of RAM to 12GB of RAM. What a ride.I've moved only once, had a few surgeries, including a summer in '02 when tons of you wrote me awesome messages on a guestbook my then girlfriend setup . Ars has helped buy me a 24" monitor so I could see better, given me many friends, and a place to come home too when the rest of the internet is typing like a 13 year old text messaging moron.And you jokers have been here through all of it.<3 <3- CG
