He basically talks about hitting somebody in the head over and over who has a concusion. He talks about going after crabtrees ACL injury. He says cut off the head and the body will die over and over when talking about a player who has had concusions. He also adds the "first one is on me" while making the rubbing money sign with his hand. He tells players to make sure to touch or hit his head everytime they are on the pile.It's pretty bad in a Cobra Kai! sort of way.

He specifically, while being filmed for a documentary, told his defensive players to target Alex Smith and Frank Gore's head, Michael Crabtree's knee, and Vernon Davis' ankle during the playoff game against the 49ers.

Via TMQ, transcript of an NPR interview:Quote:PESCA: These people who Williams tried to imbue with aggression included, he soon noted, his own sons, top athletes, Williams said, but once just small children.WILLIAMS: I told their Little League coaches, my kids will play fast. They're going to play nasty. They're going to play tough. Please don't slow them down.

Don't know if there are others like him in the NFL, or if he's one of a kind, but either way, it seems like Gregg Williams coaching career is over.

I think it all fairness, for these guys it's a job. Guys that win a lot get paid and guys that lose a lot get fired. Holding winning above all other considerations probably isn't ethical, but the fact that it happens isn't exactly surprising.

But telling your guys to take cheap shots in the pile before the refs pull you off? To me, it's not even about the bounty program anymore, it's about a guy who was maliciously trying to harm people, and being in a position where he was able to coerce others into doing it.

The reaction I mostly heard from ex-pro and ex-big-time-college players was pretty much a resounding shrug. The general consensus was that coaches were always aware of injuries on the other side and exploiting those injuries definitely came up in meetings. The Herm quote has become a joke, but you do play to win the game. At the pro level, winning is incentivized far, far above any other concern.I'm not saying it's right - but the faux-outrage and disbelief that something like this could possibly be going on is ridiculous. It's a violent game. Hitting the other guy so hard that he can't go on or at least is thinking more about protecting himself than the play has been part of the game for a long time, for better or worse. Literally everyone that's old enough to play even junior high football was alive when the biggest defensive highlight show on TV was called "Jacked Up".It's cynical, I admit, but the big public crackdown seems like PR spin. The NFL ignored concussion studies until it couldn't anymore, and now they're "fixing" it. It's extremely important that the NFL convinces the general public that dirty players who flaunt the new rules and deliver excessive hits are what makes football dangerous. That's something they can sort of police. If the conversation turns to the actual science and the fact that repeated, sub-concussive blows to the head can cause serious damage, the NFL is in a much more uncomfortable position.

I read about this crap this morning. Gregg Williams should never be allowed to coach or be associated with NFL ever again. Ever. Also, someone should take out his ACL, or "turn his head sideways" Jerk.

They are focusing on limiting the major hits that can destroy a players career with one hit. They are removing plays that have little to no effect on the game except to injure another player. They are taking steps to ensure player saftey while not throwing out the entire sport. How is that difficult to understand? Of course it is PR, big hits that end a career is what gets media attention, repeated hits for 8 years of HS/College ball and then professional career don't.

Of course it is PR, big hits that end a career is what gets media attention, repeated hits for 8 years of HS/College ball and then professional career don't.But the entire sport isn't safe. That's sort of my point. Arguably, a bit hit the ends a guy's career is better for his long term health. If playing football is fundamentally bad for your brain, the sooner your career ends the better off you'll be. I absolutely agree that they can't change that without fundamentally altering the game. I completely get why they don't want to turn the NFL into flag football. But refusing to make drastic changes does mean player safety is not the top priority.

I don't see why it would. I mean, if the argument is that cumulative hits to the head cause damage over the long term then stopping late hits isn't going to address that completely; RBs and WRs get hit in the head all the time, for example.(Note that I'm not saying they should totally neuter the sport on the basis of this rationale. As far as I'm concerned, if someone wants to do something that might end up in them getting seriously injured, that should be their free choice to make.)

There's a difference between being hit when you're ready to be hit, and when you're not. After the whistle, more damage can be done. That's what I mean about late hits. Penalize the shit out of it. I'm not talking about the one full step rule on sack attempts, either. That was miscalled by refs several times. I'm not saying that I know what needs to be done, by any means. Don't change a thing about the way the rules are now, but increase fines and suspensions for blatant acts after the whistle, and "bounty" shit like this. It needs to stop.

As kind of an aside, I used to work with (and am still distant friends with) a scientist who works almost solely on testing and improving PPE (personal protective equipment) including sports gear. He devised quite a few tests for helmets that apparently are now becoming standardized and required for any new products that get approved by NCAA/NFL type associations. Really smart guy. I haven't talked to him in several years, but I did see him on TV once, talking about the direct improvements that Riddell made in direct response to some of his testing and monitoring methodologies. Cool part was, when we used to work together, part of his lab was a deep freezer filled with cadaver parts...including human heads.

Quote:Because they would have to start using flags if small blows to the head were going to be considered.In flag football, you don't get a helmet and you still take blows to the head. It wouldn't address the issue and arguably would make it worse.The reason concussions are talked about is because they are a noticeable and measurable injury with serious side effects, many in the very short term and some in the short term. Once someone has one, their brain has a high likelyhood of swelling. A second concussion in the same game can kill that person. Small hits may cause negative side effects later in life or they may not, but they frequently do not cause A) brain swelling, B) increased risk of death within 24 hours, C) increased risk of seizures within 24 hours (see Chargers), D) loss of balance and cognizance that can lead to further serious injuries, head-related or otherwise, or E) continued concussion-related symptoms for weeks or months (see Sydney Crosby, Rodgers, Roethlisberger).Quote:The general consensus was that coaches were always aware of injuries on the other side and exploiting those injuries definitely came up in meetings.This I agree with. If a guy does anything from tweak his ankle to get a concussion, you test him. But you don't intentionally try to break his neck or ankles or eye-gouge him in the piles. If for some reason you do think actions that are prohibited by the rules are okay, you shouldn't be surprised when there are consequences for getting caught.Quote:Cool part was, when we used to work together, part of his lab was a deep freezer filled with cadaver parts...including human heads.My wife works in the anatomy and biology department at a college. They were renovating her new lab space when she started and she found a human skull in a jar. She told the department head, who shook his head and muttered, "Again?" Pysgard

I just caught the end of an NFL films story on Kurt Warner and watched the hit that essentially led to his retirement. Blindside hit on a QB out of the play by ... the Saints. Whooops. I'm a bit surprised they didn't edit that part, being part of the NFL Network and such.

IMO this course of action puts them in an even worse position.If cigarette companies responded to health studies with a fancy new filter and were careful to make no mention of the fact that smoking was still fundamentally bad for you, they'd be hammered for it. Rightly. Even if they never actually say the new filter makes cigarettes safe, the combined implication is grossly irresponsible.Honesty and full disclosure seems like a sounder legal strategy if something is dangerous and you can't really mitigate that danger.

Arizona, Green Bay, Minnesota, New England, Philadelphia, and Washington have 5. Have to make room for the sucky teams like the Browns and Bengals that only have 2 divisional opponents in the second half. Wonder who the NFL things is going to be out of the running early? It is a good thing, means teams leave their starters in at the end of the season when it might otherwise not matter as much. You're never going to see the Steelers sitting out and losing to the Browns for the finale, that would be all kinds of wrong.

If the NFL were serious about cutting back on player injuries they'd quit adding Thursday night games. They started last year making an emphasis on conference games late in the year to make them more meaningful.

Quote:It seemed like last year was only 3 or 4 of the last half were intra-conference. /toolazytocheckYou mean division games, not intra-conference right? There would be 12 intra-conference games a season versus 6 division games. That would be 6 or 3 per half on average. 5 may be statistically much higher than 3 but it's not that much when you can only count in integers, and as mentioned it balances out the teams with 4 in the first half.
