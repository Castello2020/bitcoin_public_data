When you bring heightened emotions and anger into a rational conversation, that's where anything and everything becomes impossible to do because you cannot rationalize with an emotional person.I also call bullshit on Linus' comment about cursing being a part of Finnish culture. Dude needs to take a chill pill.

Linus comes from a different generation of developer and an older, freer time on the internet, before everyone had to pretend to be nice to everyone. And you know, he's Linus Torvalds, he ain't got to explain it.FFS, Microsoft wrote the software that made it a household name back when its developers would get into profanity-laden screamfests during meetings. There's something to be said for just getting everything out of your system, then going out for a beer with the person you just had a knock-down with.

In a world where the OS is named after you, there is going always to be a battle of egos. Granted I think that Torvalds has found this methodology in being an asshole fruitful, but it doesn't mean it is always right. You catch more bees with honey, or that's been my experience. When you have a disagreement with folks the best is to co-opt them and recruit them to do better but in a way they feel good about it. Right now Linux is on a big upswing and that's great, but this mentality won't go over well when Linus is out of the picture.

It is possible to be assertive and straightforward without being a complete jackass. Linus being a jackass has nothing to do with managing the Linux kernel.

I wasn't aware that acting like a preening egotistical jackass was an ethnic trait of the Finnish people. Most anyone I've ever met from that area has been quite polite. The whole thing reeks of the kind of justification you see in self diagnosed 'Aspies' on the Internet so they can act like jerks and not get called on it.

There's hurt pride here on both sides, it looks like. Truth and bluntness without *any* tact is lazy. But there is validity to the fear of communication being hampered by too much tact. Simply put, they should both acknowledge each others opinions have basis in reality, realize that there is a sliding scale of tact not a binary flag, and work on. Also, be the change, not preach it.

This seems less about being "professional" and more about being "courteous". Mr. Torvalds doesn't seem to get the concepts of manners, civil discourse, or polite discussion. While he might be correct in advocating a more direct management style within the Linux development community, he doesn't have to be rude, arrogant, or obnoxious to do that.

It isn't about bluntness, honesty, PC, or tact it's about rationalizing abusive behaviors.

It's a bit embarrassing, but I doubt Linus will change. It's rude, and it's bullying, and when he says it's part of the Finnish psyche rather than a choice he makes, it's just an excuse.In the end, it's not that big a deal. After all, developers have had to deal with the quirks and behaviour of Richard Stallman for decades... Linux is too big for one man to derail, even if he did create it...

I don't know Torvalds and it's impossible to judge a person by a few publicized sound-bytes, so I'm speaking very philosophically as I wonder this aloud: isn't the whole "I speak my mind", "I say things how they are", "I don't sugar coat things", or "If you don't like what I have to say, that's your problem" just a ruse? Isn't the person saying those things always an asshole?Again, not speaking about Torvalds personally because I don't know him enough to judge him. Whenever I meet someone who spends a lot of time saying rude or intentionally abrasive things, it's because they're generally a mean spirited person; all the "reasons" they give for their rude and abrasive personality is simply a way for them weasel out of sounding like a bad person. Everyone probably knows these types, and they always seem to have something rude or mean to say about everyone and everything, and usually don't seem like very nice people in general.

For what it's worth, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates both built some extremely succesful companies by being assholes to their employees when they thought they needed a good chewing out. Then again, they would also sprinkle bits of praise now and again. (a distinction would be these people are voulenteers, but I don't think that it's an important factor).

"help Linux development circles become more welcoming to those who prefer polite collaboration over confrontation"she's not even asking for polite collaboration, just basic manners and rules of conduct. you can be confrontational without being violent or rude. people like Linus can only be assholes because they are in a position of power. his position is akin to the richest 1% arguing they are an oppressed minority.

Abusive behavior is well-suited to intimidation, but it's about the worst possible way to inculcate voluntary cooperation. Frankly, most of the people in the field have a high enough IQ that they're used to having their work valued highly, and if all it gets them is a threat that some goon will smack them upside the head, they have about a zillion other choices.In the end, this isn't about politeness: it's about effectiveness in shepherding the shared objective. If somebody needs to be told their contributions are unwelcome, it matters how they're told only insofar as most human beings will not voluntarily come into situations where verbal abuse is the likely outcome, with the possibility of contributing a lower probability.So I imagine Mr. T, should he be capable of learning, would profit from a few moments reflection on how to get MORE of the quality he wants, rather than being creative in bludgeoning those who he doesn't value.

If you're dragging it out with a Luke mind, sure, but you can't treat strangers or people not used to your style that way. Not should you expect those who don't take it well to just Man Up and deal. No, it's EVERYONE'S job to work to communicate. No one is so privileged or valuable that you don't have to adapt to other people's communication styles. For a community supposedly about free expression and contribution, this sounds a lot more like Microsoft on one of Ballmers chair throwing days. Seriously, Linus, we all know you're a cantankerous old bastard. No ones asking you to put on a dress and play tea time. Just dial it down a notch and stop acting like the kind of insane corporate clown you claim to hate so much. Either that, or give up the claim that Lunux is a community and just call it your personal fiefdom, if you can't play well with others

Sharp's verbiage here is rife with the sort of vocabulary and dialectical text styles that the "social justice" folks on the Internet tend to employ.While I'm all about people being nice to each other, that particular Internet subculture (the "social justice wank" folks; not to be confused with people who actually work towards Social Justice instead of just getting angry about things online) tends to frequently be unnecessarily confrontational and of in itself, while demanding that the other subcultures that its adherents enter into should conform to their particular sensitivities.As such, I'm not particularly inclined to take her side on this matter.

First of all - don't take his "Finnish culture" comment literally. I'm willing to bet it's just to point out that cultural sensitivity can go both ways, and thus is a non-argument.Secondly - this guy Linus could easily be objective without insulting. Take for instance:"...not telling people clearly enough that I don't like their approach, they go on to re-architect something, and get really upset when I am then not willing to take their work."It's pretty damn easy to say "Your approach doesn't work with the current architecture. I won't accept anything along those lines if you go through with it."Objective, straight forward, and little emotion. Obviously the dude just enjoys belittling others. I wonder how much his wife has had to deal with the bullshit.

The problem is that all the Linux contributors can't go for a beer because they're all over the world. Effective internet communication and collaboration is vastly different from effective personal communication and collaboration.

Linus obviously doesn't want anything to do with such a culture. That doesn't make him unprofessional, and speaking ones mind doesn't make them an "asshole." They just do things differently than others and hold different values.

I wonder if Torvalds would change him tune if someone popped him one. POW, RIGHT IN THE KISSER. He seems to have no qualms threatening and verbally berating others, because he sees himself as the alpha dog. Wouldn't hurt for someone to knock him down a few pegs, and teach him that treating folks like garbage can eventually catch up with you.

Management by perkele is highly effective because it dispenses with ego, ambiguity, and platitude in order to get results. If something is awful shit, call it so, and move on. As a Canadian, I loathe American management style, where every project has a committee struck in order to meet endlessly and verbally fellate one another long enough to come to some sort of highly-diluted consensus. I realize that this a cultural difference, and that neither way is "better", but I *do* prefer a task-driven authoritarian approach: Thoroughbreds on the design board have the tendency to come out at the end as thoroughbreds rather than dromedaries.

Linus Torvalds seemed like such a soft-spoken guy back in the days of the Revolution OS documentary. Now he has me cheering on RMS and the GNU Hurd. I hope he kick's Torvalds' ass with it someday.
