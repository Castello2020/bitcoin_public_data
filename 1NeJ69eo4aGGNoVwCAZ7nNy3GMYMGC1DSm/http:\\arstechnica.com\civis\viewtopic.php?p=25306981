One should point out that the report indicate there MIGHT be duplication and some these IT programs only eppeared to be duplciates of others. I read multiple articles on this same report only one so far quoted the full statement where the word might was used.

In my experience the biggest net positive in the centralization of Gov IT is the inherent de-duping. The legacy stuff was rife with it. Not to mention incredibly poor security due to rank obligations. Full disclosure: I'm a contractor, I could be biased.

I've seen many a fiasco get started because people at 64,000 feet high saw two similar applications and start thinking "we should combine these". Just because it sounds the same doesn't mean it is the same.By the time you get all the competing requirements settled out, two systems that would have cost $1 million apiece end up costing $10 million combined.

The F-35 has increased over 93% beyond initial cost estimates, so a bit of duplication in IT seems par for the course.August GAO reports the F-35 total program cost now estimated at around 400 Billion, and that's assuming things work out from now on. Vanity Fair has an excellent long-form (7-page) investigative article which casts some doubts on whether things are working out at all, let alone from now on. http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2013 ... eed-martin

The thing I find most amusing about this article is that while I enjoy the context provided by the fact that the duplicated efforts is equal to around 1 1/3 the cost of an F-35 (A, B, or C?), I actually think I'd rather they waste extra money on duplicated IT efforts rather that hideously overpriced and underwhelming hangar queen.

As a former code monkey for such projects, duplication of effort is the *least* of potential savings. You'd be better off starting with the layers upon layers of low level bureaucracy that exists solely to serve the "process" -- a process those layers are busy making more complex and inefficient because they really have nothing else to do with their time.

Those of us who liked playing around with computers when we were at school, and so took it up as a career, tend to hold on to a profound misconception of the purpose of "IT" as some noble endeavour, which is contributing to human progress. We are sadly mistaken. It is really a excuse for those who liked playing the system, learning only the curriculum and getting their jollies from team sports when they were at school, and so took up management as a career, to build empires and hoard budgets. It is perfect for this role. Unlike services, you can convince the people with money (governments, investors) that it is a form of production, like manufacturing. But, at the end of the day, there won't be a warehouse somewhere full of physical objects you can count. Hence the proliferation of all manner of flim-flam methods of accounting and development methodologies, in public-sector IT, and patents in the private sector, to pretend that the ~50% of IT projects that are pointless have provided "value" of some kind.

Only 12 out of 590 investments indicated potential duplication. I'd say that number is quite low but the one program that is sticking out from the report is HHS - Secure One costing 195.59 million which is making up the majority of the 321.25 million figure.I'm not sure on GAO's math here because even if you remove duplicate programs you will not recover the costs of all of the programs to reach the 321.25 million figure. At best you going to save money by cutting out the cheaper programs and save that figure.For argument's sake let's assume you combine the programs and only spend the maximum cost of the highest program. (For example, If program A costs 30 million and program B costs 10 million, you would save 10 million from de-duplication and spend 30 million). My quick analysis and shaky math below: DHS - Net savings of 6.67 millionCBP program spent 23.60 millionICE program spent 6.67 million DOD Health - Net savings of 3.01 millionHealth Care Army program spent 6.84 millionHealth Care Other program spent 9.85 millionDOD Dental - Net savings of 4.83 millionDOD Corporate program spent 9.82 millionDOD Common Access program spent 4.99 millionHHS IT Security - Net savings of 60.9 million Enterprise IT Security program spent 14.97 millionIndian Health program spent 37.02 millionFederal Information Systems Security program spent 8.91 millionHHS-One program spent 195.69 millionHHS Medicare - Net savings of 2.13 millionMedicare National Coverage Database spent .83 millionMedicare Local Coverage Database spent 2.96 millionTotal savings if you remove all the duplicate programs per agency from report = 70.87 million Now this is a far cry from the 321.25 million figure that GAO puts out. Unless the agencies are just going to cancel all these programs you not going to get to the 321.25 million figure. Anyone know how GAO is getting their 321.25 number? Am I missing something here?Report can be found here:PDF of Report

I being an ex-IT government contractor find this not shocking at all. However that is not to say it isn't i'm just numb to it after years of exposure. Here's a few facts to fill in the gaps for those who haven't had to deal with this as their FT job. 1. The different pieces of the government do not play well with others and they do not like to share. Once the accountants find out they start every fire possible on who is going to pay for what and the never see "the big picture". It is borderline a pissing match "well we paid for it why should you get to use it?" and "I'm not paying my staff to do your job" and other like comments. 2. This is also the same government that basically punishes people by staying under their annual budget. We would get threatened to have less money the next fiscal year because we had money left over at the end.3. The people who get the final say, and come up with these projects, 99% of them have no IT knowledge outside of Microsoft Office applications. They see it on TV and say make it happen. I wish I were making this up. It gets better if they don't like what you have to say i.e. "This is a waste of money" "We already have something that does that but without this one feature" etc You get told essentially you are a contractor and are replaceable. 4. I'm going to stop here because i could go on for days and even provide a novella on each situation edit: for grammar

Now seriously, this is to be expected of any large organization. I've seen it in many companies, where divisions dismiss corporate projects as having pie-in-the-sky requirements or need the projects done before the large effort can be completed. So smaller, redundant projects sprout all over the place.--B

Jobe1983 wrote:"You don't think they spend $20,000 on a hammer and $30,000 on toilet seat do you?"That line amuses me because I know where each of those comes from. The gold plated hammer was actually a tactical repair toolkit designed to be used outside the sonically shielded envelope of attack submarines. Someone was tasked with making a toolkit that wouldn't make any sound when used in that role, they did so and then two toolkits were ordered for each submarine in the fleet and the research costs were spread over the number of units ordered resulting in a very high per piece cost. The kit was still a tiny, tiny fraction of the cost of losing a submarine because a tool rattled around at the wrong moment. The toilet seat was actually an entire lavatory, the planes had been flying for 50 years or so and their service lives were extended after wing inspections showed usable life left so they underwent an overhaul. Part of that overhaul was a new lavatory, which required a custom very large mold to be produced to make the single piece toilet enclosure because the original molds had obviously not been hanging around for 50 years, and again that mold was used to create a lavatory for a handful of aircraft again leading to a high per-unit cost and of course costing significantly less than developing a new airframe (the seat by the way was a cheap off the shelf unit). Both were cases where money had been prudently spent to offset much larger costs but because they had high per-unit costs some politician decided to roll them out as a soundbite. There is PLENTY of waste within the federal government, but these two "well known" examples weren't.

I have been working in the DoD for over 26 years and have watched the “creation” of IT as we know it today take place. If you are doing the math, then you will realize that my time in the military started before the explosion of civilian internet. Back in those days, the internet (a lot of us still called it DARPAnet back then, even though that was the wrong term by the late ‘80s) was mainly used to transfer files between main nodes in the defense network and also in our university/research systems. A huge amount of what became the government IT structure was truly discovery learning. This is very important to remember when assessing why things may not work so well today, from a duplicative effort standpoint. The bottom line is that many of the technologies we take for granted in the civilian side were created by and for the military just to solve problems no one had known about before. Another key thing to remember here is the scope of the issue. There is literally no other organization on the planet that has to deal with the range of IT issues the DoD has to deal with. Besides being the largest employer in the world (by quite a lot – DoD currently employs about 3.2 million people – the only civilian company in the same league is Walmart with around 2 million employees), the DoD also has to be able to communicate on every continent, across (and under) every body of water, in the sky and in space. And, they are expected to handle that communication with 100% uptime – no one in Congress wants to hear about our critical systems going down – ever. Combine that with the fact that these systems literally have to survive combat conditions, and you begin to realize how difficult it is to form an IT “structure” for DoD that is consolidated. Should the dental IT structures be consolidated? I guess so. Should you consolidate the IT structures for controlling weapons systems? Definitely not. I am all for saving the tax payers money, but, as one poster noted above, you need to be very, very careful when you take a look at the largest organization in the world and start nit-picking the IT systems. On the other hand, we absolutely need the GAO to do this. If we don’t have someone come in from the outside once in a while and tell us where we are messed up, we can’t improve. Unfortunately, the consolidation efforts have taken their toll. Usability is at an all-time low in military networks. Despite numerous articles about DoD adopting new technology like Blackberries, iPhones, iPads, etc, the reality is that those devices are used on maybe 1-2% of DoD networks and, most likely, you just won’t be able integrate any modern devices into DoD use. That is not to say the DoD doesn’t use smartphones and tablets, it just means that those devices are pretty much standalone or sandboxed to the point where your $1000 iPhone (the DoD doesn’t usually buy “locked” phones) is pretty much… just a phone. If you can get an iPhone, it will be locked down to the point where you cannot add music or photos or videos, no “unauthorized” apps (forget apps that cost money), no connection to the iStore, and, of course, all texts and emails will be monitored, logged and recorded (which is not that big a deal – that is the same for all DoD IT services). BYOD on military networks is not an option, for fairly obvious reasons. Worse, though, use of the physical IT networks has gotten ludicrous. Right now, if we want to move ANY device from one physical network port to another network port (think, I want to move this printer across the room), it requires a trouble ticket and (you can’t make this up) the ticket goes to another post 300 miles away where the IT services for our region have been consolidated. The contractors who run the admin services there will look at your request in a timely manner (think 2-3 working days) and then either fly someone out to our location or send a contractor locally to come in to the room, move the device to another port, call them to authorize the port change, and then leave. This was done in the name of “consolidating services” to “save money” and “improve security”. And I am not on some small, out of the way post – I currently work on one of the largest military bases in the country – we have over 3000 personnel in my unit alone and we are the smallest unit on our post. So, now, it costs the government at least $1000 for me to move a printer across the room. Brilliant.

How do we know these duplicated IT projects could be successfully combined? Does anyone in the government fully understand all these systems, and know that they are compatible?Sounds like yet another boondoggle of spending for IT consulting: the de-duped Whatever 2.0 would cost billions and never be completed, while the legacy systems would have to be maintained and enhanced. Even if the system was completed, there would be a total scorched-earth turf war over who got to run the new system, which could get ugly. (That's all "cyber command" ever was - a huge turf war to create a new 4-star general and add a layer of management on top of all the layers that were already there.)

The F16 was the last planeproduced that was a win-win for the US and US taxpayers in terms of air superiority vs cost. The F-35, while a very cool plane, is not worth the cost. FYI on the F-16:"In May 2013, Lockheed Martin stated it has enough orders to keep producing F-16s until 2017, with more orders possible."As for the F-35 "In production with 1763 planned, currently 13 for testing"You do the math as to how much 1763 of these planes will cost.

Brilliant.I work for a government in Canada that did the exact same thing, in the name of "efficiency" and "saving money". Before they started, we'd get a call about an application support issue (which was usually someone walking over to our office and asking), and resolve it typically in a few minutes.Now people aren't allowed to talk to us, they have to send things by email (or phone) to another office on the other side of the city. It takes those people currently 2 days (and counting) to look at the ticket, and then send it back to us because it's an applications call. At that point we can actually do something about it.Smart users have learned to cheat the system and CC us while sending the email in, and we inevitably have the problem fixed before the new "efficient" office has even looked at it, let alone realized its something they can't do and send it to us. Less fortunate users just get to wait a few days in the name of "efficiency".The whole thing is a total joke. This is what happens when politicians and career managers start interfering with the people who do actual work.

I think the F-35 should be the metric we use for measuring all government cost. NASA's budget = 100 F-35's without maintenance. See how that brings everything into perspective?

This would be one of the reasons people laugh at the "nothing to cut hysteria" whenever it comes to reigning in the budget.There is always waste to cut. If small businesses can find waste a giant leviathan like the US government can find waste.
