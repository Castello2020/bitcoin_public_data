I suppose I just hadn't seen him work out, until recently. The proliferation of solid token makers in DKA probably helped.

The second he rotates he's a 10 cent junk rare

Mentor of the Meek in the more control-ly lingering souls deck would probably be good. If nothing else, drawing a shitload of cards is always hilarious.

You guys realize we are talking about limited here right?Or at least we originally were till people just wanted to use this as a time to dump on how bad the current standard is. rc_ian

Had a good time at GP: Seattle this weekend, even if I didn't play in the main event. Finally got my Mana Drains and foil Cities of Brass signed by Mark Tedin, played some games against an old friend at R&D, and picked up a couple foils that I'd been looking for. Cannot recommend attending such an event enough.

Quote:You guys realize we are talking about limited here right?Or at least we originally were till people just wanted to use this as a time to dump on how bad the current standard is.I think the current standard is actually really good. There are a lot of viable decks and things are changing at a fairly rapid pace. Mentor is decent in limited, not exactly a bomb but definitely a card to consider highly.EDITTo compare, think about it this way. He's a vanilla 2/2 for 2W and his ability requires another creature to trigger. Elvish Visionary was 1G for a vanilla 1/1 that immediately drew you a card. So even if your trigger creature is only a single mana it means that best case scenario Mentor is going to require 4W to cantrip. Obviously that gets better if you can trigger him more than once, but he is also very fragile.

Being fragile (unless it's X/1 fragile) is pretty common in ISD, given the variety of removal in the format. His effect is huge and requires a kill/exile spell rather than just a tap/pacifism. The synergy with the large variety of white ETB creatures (doomed traveler, token makers, etc) means you almost certainly have a few sick synergies with him.On similar note, Loyal Cathar has been amazing for me. As long as I'm base white, he's great. Young Wolf has been similar. I like that they both enable demonmail hauberk, which I've been snapping up late and getting good value out of.i've also had some success with decks that are near-mono green. Green has been under picked in my experience, and I've been able to get pretty potent creatures decks going with some splash removal and prey upon keeping opponents under control.

The synergy with the large variety of white ETB creatures (doomed traveler, token makers, etc) means you almost certainly have a few sick synergies with him.His effect isn't that huge unless you can trigger it multiple times. Yeah, it has some synergy with Doomed Traveler but if your big turn four play is making a spirit token and paying a mana so your three drop becomes a cantrip isn't what I'd define as huge. Again, most of the decks that want to run him don't want to make all their bears cost three instead of two. He's great if you have a reliable and repeatable way to trigger him (Stitcher's Apprentice for example) but otherwise you're running an aggro deck and kneecapping your curve to do it.EDIT:Again, don't think he's a bad card. But he's not a bomb and I wouldn't want to try to draft around him. He's a value card that you throw in to a W/X deck if you've got a reasonable amount of ways of triggering him. If you draw cards with him be happy, but he isn't a win condition.

Finally broke down and bought Cursed Scrolls this week. Could have got them at half the price two weeks ago. Never been a fan of them in MBC (I always rocked 4 tombstalkers to just finish games fast) but that was before Liliana.I know Magic is doing great but Hasbro firing all those people doesn't bode well on how much better Magic will probably be required to perform by the suits.

We had a good weekend. The silly store near me had two boxes of Planechase(set of 4 per box) for $50 each.Also picked up 2 Gleeful Flames event decks for 18 each. Will probably go back and pick up a box of Archenemy for the hell of it.

The transition for the old ui should be beginning soon on production servers. Seems like you can use either the current v3 client or the new client for some period of time.

You can also apply to be in the beta to see the new UI. I got in after a few days, I think they're hurting for public testers.The new UI is better (and looks less 90s) but it's not mind-blowing, so don't get too excited. KParks

The instructions were on the main MTGO window (the one that lists the top clans, etc) as of a few days ago. I can look it up again tonight if I remember.

Did a quick Google look-around as I finished up lunch.. was this it?http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/a ... /12062011dfollowed by:http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers ... a_id/1151/I got to a sign-up page for the Beta but there was an option for a dxdiag submission, I figured I'd do it at home on my gaming PC since I'm on my work computer now heh.Yam-Koo I'm not sure the UI could be any worse at all, at this point any improvement will be mind-blowing I've been looking for screenshots but haven't found any to drool over, yet. Actually if the UI is anywhere near usable I'll probably completely migrate to MTGO aside from my Thrax-EDH and Legacy Enchantress decks. I've dropped my local MtG group, well rather just their Facebook grouping as it tends to be filled with just very new, very vocal know-it-alls or guys who are trying to be smart purely by being contrary; the old group I used to play with has split in different directions, majority moving to different states for whatever reason, the guys who are here refuse to take part in the group, too. Bummer, though, I still enjoy the game a lot, I just don't care for Standard, Draft, or Modern much though which is what 99.99% of the group lends itself to while at the same time being somewhat hostile towards any other format.Thanks again for the heads-up though, didn't know the new client was anywhere near ready for showing let alone testing.

I'll never understand the MTGO ethos of "we'll put out a format, it will sell well, and we will then turn it off on an arbitrary date for no reason, because we hate people paying us $$ to play". Back when triple NPH draft was going on those things were firing left and right, I can't imagine how much $$ they were raking in, then one day, "Sorry, event is over, that thing you want to give us $$ to play, yeah, you go ahead and hold onto that cash, were good". Epically dumb. I took a look at the card list and it seems OK, there are some BROKEN cards that I pulled from my cube after a single session (Treachery). But 720 card is pretty big for a cube so your chances of seeing it go down. Quote:They won't say "we're printing foil power9!" but I think the suits will be giving the raised eyebrow stare more often.Not anytime soon, but I have zero doubt that day will come. The second profits start to slip, the "promise" of the reserve list will get tossed out the window and they'll start reprinting duals and the like to goose profits. Reprinting reserve list cards is a gold mine, and most shareholders don't like their companies to sit on gold mines too long.

I just opened the worst sealed I've ever opened, and 0-3d a draft for the first time. I tried two different builds out of it, both were terrible, and I had serious trouble drawing more than one land in two of the games. Any suggestions on how I could have built this in a competitive way?http://i.imgur.com/TPN3g.png

http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/A ... y/boab/186Ouch! Dude put Ponder in a modern deck (where Ponder is banned) and then made it sound like he practiced on MTGO with it against other decks, which he couldn't (as Ponder is banned). So either he's just playing against his brother in unrestricted casual (could be and that's fine if he told the truth) or he just outright made up the results of the matches and he's been doing that for years.I don't want to crucify the dude, and again, I think testing at his convenience against friends (of average or slightly above skill) is just fine. But the one single selling point he had over Ben Bleiweiss (who previously wrote the column) was that he tested against tourney room decks and not just casual roomers.Ben also mentioned opponents by name/MTGO handle, which I sometimes thought was inappropriate (although I enjoyed him calling out people by name who played dragonstorm in the casual room and other completely degenerate decks and enjoyed seeing names of people I'd played against before; it made me feel like I was part of the whole magic experience), given that he was beating up on non-pros, often with decks even more budget than his building on the budget builds.I thought that maybe van Lunen stopped that for that reason, but maybe he stopped listing names because he invented the games or always played against the same two or three buds.OTOH, if it's just real life testing he's doing, it'd be nice to feature his local store / kitchen table and people to humanize the column a bit with some photos, especially since he's not letting us feel like we're participating in a community by reading the column (even though I don't think I ever played against Ben myself, personally).I'm not sympathetic to the view that he doesn't have time to write + playtest a deck every week so shortcuts are acceptable.OTOH, I am sympathetic to the point of view that wotc doesn't print enough wicked cards to do the sort of thing Ben did back in Rav/TSP -- as most of his best decks weren't about turning creatures sideways.I mean how many different asshole things could you do with cloudstone curio in every freaking color? There's not much similar to that in modern sets. Losing stacked damage wrecked a lot of the possibilities for incremental advantage decks, too, which were a budget specialty. Plus the whole mythic and planeswalker thing.

I'm confused since you first say you opened a sealed pool then say you oh-three'd a draft. Also, you only have Seance, Divine Reckoning, and Curse of Stalked Prey for rares that I can see. So yeah... terrible sealed pool Pysgard

Is this one of the 4-pack sealed, 30 card minimum decks?I would go g-w-splash. All your green is low curve and fixing enabling, you have 2 or 3 bears in white, and I think splashing blue for stalker, spectral flight, and silent departure is your only hope.

There are enough spirits and enchantments that it's honestly not terrible in the main.Yeah, it was 4 pack sealed. The fourth rare was vault of the archangel, which I think was by far my strongest card. Unfortunately my white and black weren't really deep enough to build a deck without splashing blue for reap the seagraf (without color fixing.)I played a deck very similar to what Asmodan suggested, but without the faithless looting and rolling temblor, adding the rakish heir and crossway vampire. Round 1 I played a bad player playing green redwith big green dudes and removal (2xprey upon, harvest pyre, brimstone volley.) Game 1 I won a close one thanks to him making a couple of misplays. I didn't see how my aggro deck could get through fast enough before his creatures were all bigger than mine (2x villagers of estwald in particular) so I swapped decks into BWu hoping to get vault online. Game 2 I mulled a 6 land hand into a 1 land hand with a 2 drop and a bunch of three drops. I never drew a third land, and he finally killed me around turn 8 or so. Game 3 was close, with me stabilizing at 2 life and beating in for a while, but I drew 4 lands in a row and he drew a brimstone volley to finish it (with 11 cards left in our decks and me with all but 1 land in play.)Round 2 I played a deck with skirsdag high priest, midnight haunting, tragic slip, tribute to hunger, a couple doomed travelers, and some other stuff. Both games he had the priest out early. The first game, I thought I could double geistflame it since he only had 1 black up, but he used tragic slip on one of his spirits and made a 5/5 that I couldn't deal with. Game 2 I never drew anything to kill it and he killed me with multiple 5/5s.Round 3 I played a fast RB deck. Game 1 he opened with reckless waif into neonate into removal into removal, and I got steamrolled. Game 2 I swapped into BW and I curved perfectly into a turn 5 active vault of the archangel and destroyed him (despite turn 1 waif again). Game 3 he opened with turn 1 diregraf ghoul, turn 2 walking corpse. I traded every chance I could, and I ended up stabilizing with massive regenerating unruly mob and a handful of 2/2s. I had him one turn away from lethal, and he flipped traitorous blood to steal my untapped guy, hit me down to 1, and then cast fires of undeath.It was a massively frustrating experience all in all.

I don't think the stacking damage thing was that big a deal. All it did was make sac effects stronger than they should have been. IMHO, the loss of incrimental advantage came from planeswalkers and WAY overpowering the 6 drop spot. Jon Finkle was talking about it in some article or something, he nailed it by saying that so many games tody are decided by who sticks the first 6 drop. It makes the game way more swingy, which is good for variance if thats what you want, but terrible for deckbuilders and players who want to build decks that win by being a little better than the opposing deck. You can't get an incrimental advatage over a titan. You need to kill it and drop your own. Which is why decks looks like they do today.

We'll still have huge splashy cards like whatever the next version of the Praetor series looks like but the titans are just too good.

Quote:I don't think the stacking damage thing was that big a deal. All it did was make sac effects stronger than they should have been.Fuck me running... we agree on something. Damage on the stack also led to a bunch of situations where it was not very intuitive (wait... he is about to hit me, but you sacrifice him... and he still hits me after he's dead?).I'm also not a fan of the titans. They are so overwhelmingly strong that it is extremely difficult to justify anything else in that slot. It even bleeds down to the five drop slot, because honestly they're generally so far and away better than any of those that it's hard not to just say 'I'll pay one more and just play a titan'. I'm also not fond of the fact that so many *other* potentially cool creatures at or around that cost get passed over because they just can't compete. Really a six mana creature in standard *should* do something big and impressive (and likely win you the game) but the titans are not big impressive dudes. They give so much value even if they are immediately removed it's difficult to claw back even if you deal with them. Primeval Titan is probably the worst offender, closely followed by Grave and Sun Titans. Sure, you kill their six drop Prime Time, but now they're sitting on a two or three turn clock with the Inkmoth Nexus and Kessig Wolf Run they dug up.

Just crushed a draft with Endless Ranks of the Dead. Do I get an achievement for winning a game despite drawing 5 lands in a row, late game? Emkorial

Quote: It even bleeds down to the five drop slot, because honestly they're generally so far and away better than any of those that it's hard not to just say 'I'll pay one more and just play a titan'.I agree. I think it's why Sphere of the Suns is seeing so much play: 2 drops don't really matter (except snapcaster but you aren't playing him on turn 2) but a sphere gets your6 drop out a turn before the other guy.

Yeah, I've never had luck with zombies, even with the captain.I just 3-0'd another swiss, 3rd in a row. G/W humans was so ridiculously open. I had 3 gatstaf shephards, I was getting 8th pick priests and pilgrims of Avacyn, elder of laurels, deranged outcast, collar of avacyn, etc. Only lost 1 game to mana screw.On the other hand, went a pathetic 1-2 in a 4pk draft. The idea of those things is appealing, but yeah, I may have finally reached the point where I'd rather draft a good deck than try to open well.

However, you really need to move out of Swiss into 8-4. Same level of prize support (as compared to 4-3-2-2 which pays out one less pack for no good reason) as Swiss and the level of competition is much much higher.
