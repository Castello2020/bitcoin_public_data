Concussion issues are being DOWNPLAYED by ESPN, not overblown. I've been through them and the post-concussion syndrome. I've been through just about everything (short of killing myself) that these ex-NFL'er describe. I wouldn't wish this on anyone. You may think people are making shit up, but they are not. There is no just shaking it off. Actual brain damage does not heal. Congrats to you for getting through your football days without concussions. Many of us did not. And just because you didn't go through it, doesn't mean the damage isn't real.

It's a dangerous game. That danger can be minimized but never fully excluded. Injuries happen. Hell, how many people break their neck stepping out of the shower each year? I think the NFL has done and is improving what's possible to minimize injuries. No player is ignorant of the dangers they face; most of them have played the game at least a decade before turning pro.

Quote:Concussions are a matter of degree often. And light concussions happen to people quite often and they don't even realize it. The brain has a remarkable ability to repair itself.Where do you come up with this stuff? Do you understand anything about how head trauma works? The brain does not have a remarkable ability to repair itself. The brain, much like the rest of your CNS, is fragile. Once something breaks, the body may be able to stop further damage (may!), but the damage done is already done. This is why ALS, MS, CTE, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases are so debilitating. The worst part is, is that the very small amount of damage that causes some these diseases is almost never noticeable when it occurs. The damage is ongoing and cumulative, however, and 10, 20, 30 or more years later reaches a critical mass where the symptoms are very visible. Nothing can be done at that point except slow the disease progression and treat the symptoms. These are progressive CNS diseases that the body can NOT recover from.For an example, read articles 1-34 at this link or any of the 153 articles here for a better understanding of brain trauma and progressive neurodegenerative diseases. There is still a lot more research to be done to determine exact causes and hopefully some clinical research into repairing the damage, but we certainly have a wealth of scientific knowledge on head trauma that you should read about instead of spouting your non-scientific and incorrect beliefs. You are demonstrably wrong and until you take the time to educate yourself fully, you should not be repeating your non-scientific nonsense where anyone who might incorrectly make a decision based on it.Don't mistake me for saying that playing football will inevitably lead to any of these diseases. There is only weak correlation at this point, no causation. These guys who have committed suicide and whose brains show signs of neurological damage could have been exposed to a chemical that caused it, bumped their head going down the stairs or in the shower, by crushing beer cans on their forehead, or some combination. Who knows? I am only pointing out that the brain does not have a magical ability to repair itself from head trauma, regardless of the cause.

Who knows? I am only pointing out that the brain does not have a magical ability to repair itself from head trauma, regardless of the cause.That's true in a literal sense, of course. However, the brain is capable of "rerouting" itself in many cases, such that in effect an injury to one part of it can be entirely mitigated by making use of resources elsewhere, much like a traffic system can continue to function perfectly well if a sinkhole develops on a side street. At least, that's the way my neurologist explained the general function to me; my condition, unfortunately, is akin to that sinkhole appearing on a major freeway with no other roads around, which is why I'll always have symptoms.Anyway, the point is it's not that unreasonable nor unrealistic to say that the brain "has a remarkable ability to repair itself". It does, it's just that it can only do so up to a point and as more and more evidence comes in, it's looking like football, like some other sports, has a tendency to take players' brains well beyond that point.

Quote:However, the brain is capable of "rerouting" itself in many casesBut that is not repair. Your CNS is using previously unused but intact pathways. If those pathways are then damaged, it will have to find another unused pathway. When you run out, you run out.Quote:such that in effect an injury to one part of it can be entirely mitigated by making use of resources elsewhereNot exactly true. Even though your CNS may be using some other pathway, the damage itself has not gone away. Inflammation in particular is progressive. Without getting into it too much (read some of the research I linked to), inflammation can cause some cells in the brain to become too aggressive and start attacking other brain cells, and then those cells start doing the same thing. This is why these things get worse over time after the trauma is gone. It is just not visible until too late, when the brain starts to run out of alternative pathways to use or memory is destroyed, or both. The damage has been worked around, but not mitigated.Quote:Anyway, the point is it's not that unreasonable nor unrealistic to say that the brain "has a remarkable ability to repair itself". It doesAgain, it has nothing of the sort, and insisting that it does in the face of scientific evidence to the contrary is not helping anyone.I am sorry to hear that you have transverse myelitis. I hope you have a full recovery.

I don't know, a part of my degree is in Computational Neuroscience, but I'm sure with your authoritative and didactic tone, you think you know more than me. I actually studied the subject, did computational modeling work with various neural subsystems, and performed research in several Neurophysiology and Neuroanatomy labs.For instance, the brain suffers light trauma every time you sneeze...you can effectively get a "concussion" if you sneeze hard enough. So everyday bumps, falls, accidents etc and other types of trauma can have similar effects. In those cases, the person never realizes what has happened. Brain cell death is a common occurrence, and "rerouting" of signaling pathwsys very commonplace. This is a form of "repair", but it's a repair of function, not form.I have a co-worker who is missing almost half of his left frontal lobe (tumor). You'd never know if you met him.Severe concussions have different pathologies (and they are quite rare...even in football). Here you have a hard enough inertial impact that causes the brain to actually bruise itself on the skull's interior. This is severe trauma...which still can be "repaired". But there's obviously a limit to how many of those severe impacts your brain can take.

I'm just pointing out that it can compensate for damage up to a point such that it's a kind of de facto "repair" from the perspective of the person involved. Obviously, in the case of some brain injuries that doesn't happen and, worse, some injuries are so severe (and/or cumulative) that they prompt degenerative conditions, as you mentioned.Quote:I am sorry to hear that you have transverse myelitis.

And what happens when your brain has to reroute over and over because you're getting concussions over and over?That is what it's really about. Not one big one, which is still bad but you can still recover from, but repeated concussions. It's probably not good for your long term well being if your brain has to reroute over and over.

It's probably not good for your long term well being if your brain has to reroute over and over.More importantly, the damage that was done is NOT repaired, and is causing continual inflammation and aggravation. Even though brain function is not impaired in the short term, the damage is demonstrably not repaired as shown by the long term results.I am emphasizing this because I feel it is important to impart correct knowledge to be used in decisions about whether your kids play football or not. This isn't an ACL injury and making your decision based on poor semantics has strong consequences.

The 4 players from the Saints who were given suspensions have officially appealed. One thing I completely agree with the Player's Association on is that Goddell should not be the one who hears the appeal. He shouldn't be judge, jury, executioner, and then also oversee the appeals process. The PA has filed a grievance around that to try to get someone else to take that role.The other thing the PA is claiming is that Goddell shouldn't be able to pass any judgement at all since the events in question came before the current collective bargaining agreement. I don't buy that at all.

I don't buy that at all.I agree in principle that Goodell should not make the initial judgment and hear the appeal, but I blame the NFLPA for it. The commish's office has been the "court of every instance" since before the current CBA. That should have been a deal breaker in the last round of negotiations, and for whatever reason it wasn't. Maybe it wasn't a CBA issue, but if not...why not?

I think this has more to do with the publics perception of what constitutes an appeal, then it does with this particular case and the NFL's system for discipline. Doesn't the NHL have someone below the commish handing out the penalties? How is that working out for them ...I am not sure what type of system for the NFL would result in more fairness, having a panel of players, coaches and/or owners is just going to create a mess. Having a guy underneath Goodell hand them out and appeal to Goodell is just going to create a process without any real impact on the decisions (or give the league the opporuntity to backpedal on decisions based on public/NFL outrage).It is on the NFLPA, CBA, owners and coaches to make that an issue and they never seem to (at least not publicly.). The NFLPA calling foul now is a bit late to the party, and is just advocating for their players in the court of public opinion.

I think the issue that makes it complicated (and leads to strong labor unions in pro sports in general) is the players aren't employed by the league. They're employed by the team owners, and the league is effectively a cartel the owners all belong to.There's probably no other sensible way to organize a pro sports league, but labor gets a lot more say than in a typical employer/employee situation.

The big problem is, there is no fair way to do it. Every faction (Commish, Owners, Players, Fans) has a different POV on what constitutes fair. If Fans had their way, everyone BUT the player on their team would get suspended. If Players had their way, players would never get fined or suspended, if Owners had their way, players would play simply play for the love of the game and we fans would tithe the NFL. So talking about fair is going to get you nowhere. In the end Goodell is CEO of the NFL, only answerable to the Owners.

The worst part is that the players union is a joke. What's the point of having a union that concedes to the owners/signed players every demand? I really don't know why they don't carry insurance for every player that played. 15% from every player with an addition 5% from the owners should be enough to self insure. I wouldn't mind seeing the colleges dropping in 10% of football revenues so that college players can have a safety net.

Some good news for football: NFL players living longer than general populationQuote:The main conclusion of the NIOSH study, which it says was commissioned by the union, is that players in the study had a much lower rate of death overall compared to men in the general population. This means, on average, NFL players are actually living longer than men in the general population which contradicts a popular notion that former NFL players live into their mid-50s.Out of the 3,439 players in the study, 334 were deceased. Based on estimates from the general population, NIOSH had anticipated 625 would be deceased.(h/t to daring fireball)

Keep in mind there is a big difference between being deceased and suffering from injury. The study isn't taking that into account. It would be nice to know how ex-NFLers compare to the gen pop on ability to walk, general motor skills vs where they were in their 20s, arthritis, dementia, Alzheimers, post-concussion syndrome, depression, etc. You know, generally all the stuff you have to worry about after getting multiple concussions.

Most of those diseases are terminal, though. If you get Parkinson's, you are likely to die in a relatively finite amount of time - if not from Parkinson's directly, then from complications. It's not like if you get it at age 40 you'll live to 90 so long as you have someone to push your wheelchair around. 50 is a little more realistic.
