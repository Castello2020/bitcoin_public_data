WTF. I'm glad I have a playset of Personal Tutors, somewhere (from the mystical tutor banning era), but WTF.

Maybe I'm missing something obvious, but how would this really be useful? The thing with the Miracle mechanic is that you have to play it immediately, right? So taking an extra turn immediately after your draw phase doesn't seem that special.

How sad are you when you draw Temporal Mastery at the start of turn 2. "I only need to be one phase further and I could play this..."

Soulbound could be tracked pretty easily by overlapping the long edge of the two cards. Miracle...we'll see. Even if it won't be broken in standard, I don't love it. It seems too good in the old formats.

Hmmm, avoiding spoilers for AVR is going to be challenging Mostly came to say that I did two Cube drafts on MTGO this weekend. It was the first time in like three years I'd drafted on MTGO, and I had a fantastic time. Drafted a very solid W/b aggro deck the first time, and a bad B/w reanimator deck the second time. If it weren't for some misclicks (like giving my land protection from white instead of my creature with Eight-Tails), I'd have made the finals in the first. I correctly scrubbed out the second draft tl;dr Had fun, looking forward to the Cube returning. If you didn't catch it this time, you should next time.

Putting commanders on the bottom of libraries is sweet. Not happy with Giselbrand, if there is anything I've learned by building and playtesting and rebuilding my cube umpteen times is that lifelink is an EXTREMELY dangerous mechanic in limited. out of 400+ cards in my cube, precisely *1* has lifelink, and it's an enchanment (Armadillo Cloak). Given his CC, it probably won't matter since we won't be drafting him with unburial rites, but it still gives me the heebie jeevies to see big evasive lifelinkers. They've always been completely busted wide open in draft (Exaulted Angel, Sphinx of the Steel Wind, Chancellor of the Dross, etc)But I'm just really loving the Miracle mechanic in draft. I love the "Oh shit!" moments in MTG where you need to topdeck like a boss to suck out a game, and now they have an entire mechanic for it. I can see them being problematic in constructed. I mean, you could Top to keep sticking the new Time Walk 3rd card down, god forbid you hit a second one, to stack your turns up when you are that many turns away from comboing off. Overall I'm liking the set so far, but I've found a good limited environment usually rests on the backs of the uncommons, so we'll see what they all look like.

I think soulbond is a nice compromise in keeping both Wrath and Terror relevant, given that formats generally reward one to the detriment of the other.

When Soulbound guys ETB pair them, or when another unpaired creature ETB's, pair them.

I wonder if you can pair them up. Like if you play the new paladin and the Wingcrafter do you end up with both of them as flying double-strikers?EDIT - Yes... apparently so. That's fairly nasty.

Yeah it was from the same guy who came up with Yawgmoth's Birth Certificate (basically listed as a Mythic Rare reprint of Yawg.Will for Avacyn), the clincher was listing Wizards as an LCC as opposed to an LLC and the number crunch already not jiving with what's been spoiled richleader

Love that LSV played a deck with Shadow of Doubt in it; always wanted that to be playable.Vexing Devil should have been a 4/4 or had first strike: is it really more fair if it trades with Delver, Nimble Mongoose, etc.? Why should fairness error against red yet again?Why is blue being treated as if it wasn't making giant zombies this whole time? Why isn't white hating it as much as black (which doesn't get to take part in miracles?). Hell, Liliana's the one who saved everyone and killed the big bad. OTOH, they've yet to show us the draw backs of living in Angel Land and I'm sure there will be some.Gisela's cool and all, but I wish the ability was less splashy as the casting cost puts it out of the range of what red/white decks actually like to do, which is typical for red-white legends. Feh. Firemane Angel would have made a nice reprint for the self mill decks. OTOH, it's not nearly as intimidating (either in or out of the yard) as it was back in Rav days.

random planeswalker is... random?I guess that's one way to deal with the fact that there are a few people invested in kamigawa but it's hated enough that they won't be able to revisit it for 20 years.And why bother with another blue walker if we're going to have jace jace jace all over the place in return to ravnica in just a handful of months, anyway?The flicker focus of the set seems weird. I get that it represents things being saved. It's still weird.

I think it might be an instability flavor, kind of like a non-horrible phasing. I kind of like the mixing of planes via planeswalker. This is probably the most obviously out of place one. Kind of like those western's with Jackie Chan. And dear god, I hope they still have time to cancel a kamigawa block return if its fall 2013.

I'm hoping the flickering comes through as a useful mechanic in draft. I think it's nice to have versatile spells that help counter removal.

Tibalt must have taken a shitload of development to make a fair 2cc walker. Article was pretty good covering the issues, like having to give them low loyalty as to keep them from acting like decent life gain spells in addition to being a walker, etc.It's funny how exciting mythic miracle fireball is when it's really just... earthquake... that you have to draw into.It kind of sucks that the rare spoilers are outpacing the c/ucs by so much this season. It's USUALLY true, but never to this extent, imo?

Seems really good to me. At full price, it's 5 mana to do 2 damage to them and kill all of their delvers, spirits, and snapcasters.

LSV compared it to Flame Wave, which looks right. It's even castable without the miracle cost, though not super efficient at that cost.I really like the new PW. It seems fair for the RR cost. Not super game-breaking but an incremental advantage sort of thing and needs to be in the right deck.

Seachrome Coast is $17. Darkslick Shores is $18. Not really meaningful except that it's a counterpoint to pro-mythic zealots who said manabases would be super cheap now.Obviously you could have gotten them for less early on. But when people were shelling out $20 for shocklands, they weren't doing it just because they knew current lands would rotate in a year but because they were the best lands since 1993 and were probably as good as things were ever going to get. So probably not the best benchmark by those using "mythic=cheaper lands" argument.

In the pre-Mythic era it's entirely possible that even more of the set's value would be in the lands for a set like this.

The scars lands are one of the very few time I played MTG speculator, I picked up playsets of all of them for about $3 a peice when they came out and have been unloading then for $15 a pop over the past few weeks. I'm setting aside each sale to fund an AVR draft when it comes out. Any dual that can come into play untapped on T1 will always be worth something
