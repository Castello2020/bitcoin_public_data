We can't know how significant epigenetics is until scientists define it.Read the whole story

I think Ars is overblowing the significance of epigenetics. Phenotype is not determined just through gene sequence and epigenetics. Epigenetic's effect on phenotypic variation between human beings is probably marginal at best.

Quote:She called genetic determinism, the idea that your genes dictate who you are, a "straightjacket." For her, the chance that epigenetics meant that the genes could be overridden made the genome seem more like a "comfy sweater."You don't need epigenetics to make it a comfy sweater. All you need are interactions between genes, the environment, and ideally actions you take (e.g. exercise, education). I think those interactions are sufficiently well demonstrated without epigenetics.Some genes are a bit of a straitjacket. Eye and hair color, for example. There aren't that many determinants, and they have a strong effect. You can still wriggle your way out if you really want (contacts, dye). Most genes implicated in behavior have much, much weaker effects....

I have no doubt that, assuming the human race survives another hundred years or so, there will be genetically engineered human beings.Governments can ban it with any penalties they want, but people can't help tinkering and someone's going to do it.

An important addition to this discussion is the recognition that (in theory) every cell in your body shares the same genome, but there is no reason to believe that epigenetic changes must be identical from cell to cell. Thats provides a great deal more opportunity for complicated variation. Hence, less strait.

"Because of this, some people (including Jim Watson) have argued that none of this should be considered epigenetics—it's all just gene regulation..."I think I'd agree with this, epigenetic implies being on top of genetics, that which is inherented, not how your individual cells operate.I'm surprised people are taking it as hopeful news against "genetic determinism", was there not a study that showed children of people who were overweight had a higher chance of heart disease?

Homosexuality caused by an epigenetic marker inherited from the parent of the opposed sex is actually the best explanation that makes sense to me, and it is indeed an important social issue that should have been at least mentioned here.I am also surprised not to have seen any additional papers on the subject: It is almost a revolutionary concept and explains both the general manner in which homosexuality happens and also the anomalies about twins and siblings, for instance. I would have thought that the "born this way" proponents would fund more similar studies to confirm or debunk the (peer-reviewed) paper, if only to shut off the homophobes for good.The paper was released only last year though (reported by Ars too), so maybe it is too recent for follow-ups.

There have been suggestions that it can be "cured" - which I find utterly offensive. Any "cure" would change who I am.I expect the average homosexual would feel the same way, and surely the more appropriate "treatment" would be to cure homophobia.

Oh, imagine if there was a cure for intolerance or homophobia, would the same people fighting to protect the homosexuals be protecting the homophobic?

I believe homosexuality is some sort of an after birth behavior genetic "problem" its occurrence to that person in his much later days, or something went haywired somewhere along that line after that person has grown up and he has introduced by a third party a gay man what an orgasm is.

It just impossible to do so. Ask yourself this, can you change? Ones behavior stick to his lifespan. But if it is curable as someday by genetical engineering the process could be also reversible and make all hetrosexuals turned into homosexuals. Not by will, though.

And assimilating gays to pedos or having brain malfunctions, real educated and a great way to have nobody care about what you "believe".

The results presented are the only ones that make sense so far. We knew already from previous studies that there was some sort of genetic link, but not quite genetic either because of some unexplained anomalies, that epigenetic marker explain a lot of things. No doubt it isn't a perfect explanation, after all, it is the ONLY study that shows such a relationship so far, that's why I was hoping other scientists would work on it and develop their findings. I think it is a discovery.

nature vs. nurture all over again.our DNA starts us in a certain position, the universe does various things with/to us, and we have a bit of ability to nudge things one way or another.the postman rolls by here around 2-3 every day. i recognize the sound of the post truck's diesel. a day is 24 hours. people put up lights at christmas. i think this is partly because winter is dark and depressing, and we need something to lighten the mood....point being, the universe has rhythms and patterns, and human culture has added its own on top of that. an individual is somewhat like a jellyfish in the ocean current. if you think of the human soul/consciousness/etc as being like a network stack, i think that's a decent analogy. DNA is the ethernet hardware, gene expression is the data link layer, the rhythms of the universe are the internet layer, human culture is the transport layer, and you are the application.however, this is all just the idle observation of someone who prefers top-down analysis and knows jack squat about molecular biology.

For some reason the comments always end up with questions about curing the gays. What if the cure goes both ways? Would the heteros be interested in such thing?My suggestion is to leave the scientific speculations to the scientists.

Anyway my point is about "fear" not a "cure". Unless one's science is picking a particular conclusion, then looking for supporting evidence, any science we do do will have the potential to go in ways the audience may not desire. The comment I responded to was speculating that further research should be done to prove the homophobes wrong. Who's going to fund that? The homophobes?

Quote:When the panel was asked about cases that went beyond a maternal influence on one generation of offspring, biologist Randy Jirtle said there's only a single well-demonstrated case in mammals, and it involves coat coloration in mice.I'm guessing that by "well-demonstrated case" they meant RCT so you're not going to find human studies in that camp. It should be noted that that study, showing that, for mice, maternal diet changed phenotype expression in offspring, is already 15 years old:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9707167But the other significant study of note that I'm aware of is the "Overkalix study" which does support transgenerational epigenetic effects in humans (both grandmothers and grandfathers affecting grandchildren, ie "beyond maternal influence"):http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12404098That study is over 10 years old and I believe well known in the field so I find it surprising that it wasn't mentioned in response.

I can potentially understand that some chemicals in the body could force cells to turn on/off certain gene patterns, but I am fairly skeptical that this happens.
