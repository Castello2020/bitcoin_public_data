How the hell does having 4 cups of water & vegetables make you hungrier?Water absorbs quickly, vegetables don't get into blood as sugar for a while. Only satiety is fullness, which due to water, goes quickly.This phenomena is what makes clear soup a good appetizer. Now if you did a chili-esque thing full of beans and such, that should rate higher on the long term satiation scale.

My scale was out of commission for a week or so (I thought it was busted, turns out it just needed new batteries). I was also super busy and stressed from work, which meant I slipped a lot with me eating. It looks like I didn't do any real damage. Phew! Now to start making more progress.

I saw a low of 192.4 but have bounced back up a bit. That's okay as my clothes are getting looser and looser and I see a noticeable difference in gut size. Tyranny

My progress this monthI was pleasantly surprised after my vacation. I had some drinks (don't really care to count) but the food side was pretty much what I planned and wanted. Plus I managed to get some walking in, no swimming though.I'd better stop thinking about it too much, but I will be pretty disappointed in myself if I don't get under 100 kg before Christmas or the New Year. The loss rate may be too steep even if I didn't already give myself some leeway on the goal pace (original was 1 kg/week). I should be happy with my progress thus far, and I am, but still...

So, I've just found the health tracker on my new Samsung Galaxy S4; I'm hopeful that this will help me keep on track with counting calories. I've got 2 months before my child is born; I'm hopeful that I can lose a bit of the weight before then.

So, after months of depriving myself, and sacrificing hundreds of children whenever they angered me, I am >.< this close to being under 300lbs. It has been 'slower' these last couple of months because of my muscle gains in the gym, but I started measuring myself and the inches are really melting off even if the scale is not moving as quickly. Now that my muscle gain is leveling off, I am picking up in the weight loss area again AND losing inches.I even found that after I ate a block of cream cheese before bed, and added another 300 calories of avocado a day I dropped three pounds in a week!

I'm fighting the 210 plateau. I use a FitBit One to track my activity and MyFitnessPal to track my food and I've been bouncing between 211 and 214 for a month. I've recently started ignoring the activity adjustment that FitBit injects and am just using my "base" calories of 1430 as a goal (sometimes putting me ~500 cals below the 1000 cal deficit I'm aiming for). No results, but I keep plugging away. Historically I'll see something like: 211, 211, 212, 211, 214, 211, 208 (wtf?), 209, 208. I'm psyched for 209 because that will put my total loss at 60lbs. I was getting very discouraged with the progress, but when I look at the lean mass / fat mass numbers over the last month it averages out to only 3 lbs on the scale, but 5 lbs of fat lost. I can live with that.

There's no way that I'm approaching anything related to starving.I'm actually cutting back to 1430 because weeks at the adjusted level based on FitBit activity (usually ~2000 cals) wasn't getting me the results I wanted.

Joining in on this thread to provide some accountability to my weight loss goals.8 years ago I weighed in at 285 and decided it was time to do something about it. Luckily for me just cutting the crap out of my diet basically took care of the issue. No more pop, candy, ice cream, or (and how I gained most of my weight) fluffy coffee drinks... and I drop to 205 within two years...Fast forward to 2 months ago I'm sitting at 210, a little older and trying to keep up with a crazy toddler who loves to run and play chase. I end up at the doctors for an unrelated issue and they decide to give me a basic blood workout to get some baselines on me. And uh oh... your blood sugar seems a bit high... could you go do another test for us please...And I come back with 11.2 a1c results?! Type 2 diabetes it is. Apparently I didn't change enough fast or far enough to avoid it, though I have no symptoms as of yet. /sigh So as a part of managing diabetes I need to lose weight, get active, and cut the carbs. I'm still sort of flailing about trying to find a balance of foods that I can eat to keep everything in check which started the current weight loss journey. I've dropped about 17 pounds since May(holy hell it seems like its been longer) and I'm now aiming for about 180 or probably a better guideline back to a 32-34 inch waist. Starting a C25K program to include that as part of the weight loss and D2 maintenance regime.Fin.

Forty days ago I started my diet weighing 354 pounds, size fifty-two jeans. Today I weighed in at 310 pounds size forty-six jeans. I've still got over a hundred pounds to go but I already feel so much better. Best part my blood pressure is routinely 110/70, my cholesterol is normal as is my blood sugar and insulin levels, all in one month. They were previously extremely elevated.

HAHAHAHAHAHA! Fuck you, scale. 300.4lbs. I ended up doing a night-time walk, and did not bring enough water. I could feel my fingers puff up as my body started to retain extra water, and I do not drink a bunch after 9pm because I hate waking up to piss at night.I know that I could have just eaten clean on Saturday, and been below 300 for Sunday, but opted to keep my cheat day schedule. It just means one more week.With that out of the way, I continued my adventures in fall-down paddle boarding. I was practicing in the lake (salt lake? not sure what to call it) by my house. I found out that the middle of the lake is not really the deepest part when I fell in and sunk up to my shins in gooey mud. At least I did not go head first!So, I decided to jimmy the board onto the Tiburon, and did some surfing. At first I tried to get to clear water to try more fall-down practicing, but gave up because the waves just kept pounding me right off the board. Plus, as the high tide was coming in the water went from, 'OH MAN THAT FREEZES THE BALLS... oh, not so bad', to, 'HOLY CRAP I CAN'T FEEL MY NOSE ANYMORE'. It was still fun as hell riding a nice big board on those massive waves. I can only imagine how much fun it will be to actually stand up and surf them.Oh yes, surf wax is great for being able to stay on the board, but sucks ass when you are trying to drag yourself back on after falling off.

My last 10 days of weigh-ins:210.6, 212.7, 212.5, 211.8, 211.4, 211.7, 212, 212.2, 210.4, 211.2. The trending is going in the right direction, but boy is it slow. I've got my eye on < 210.0 and I'm not going to relent until I get there. This week I think.

Your blood vessels dilate during exercise and the muscles in your arms don't work very hard to "squeeze" the blood back to your heart (as compared to your legs).

I definitely know the signs of water retention, and I just mentioned my fingers because I always notice it first in my hands. Either way, it is no big deal. It just means bigger numbers on the scale this week, and definitely being below 300lbs.

Been an off week as far as diet and sleep patterns go (had a major release at work) but kept up on the weight lifting so the numbers are still trending correctly. The big red spike was when I was on vacation back home for 2 weeks. I drank and ate far too much (but kept up at the gym!)

When I get < 209 I'll officially hit 60lbs down. 7/25/11 is the day I weighed myself and said, "I can't do this any more". I've had a few setbacks, but I've never had as long a time where I've been focused on my health.

I've been back on the wagon for a month now. My work has gone from "The budget won't allow us to buy food" to "Turns out we have plenty of budget, buy lunch at least once a week" in this same month. I'm glad I had already started before that happened, because I have a hard time saying no unless I'm already making progress. It's weird how it's hard for me to start a plan, but then easy to stick to it. secretknight42

Well, because of bad (but wonderfully delicious) choices over the last two months, I’m up 10lb, now at around 215. Hopefully, now that I’m on a mission to lose what I’ve gained, I will drop those 10 quickly, and continue past 205, where I’ve been stuck for some time.Here are two questions since there are knowledgeable people in the thread:1. I do about one hour of cardio a day. Would it be helpful to get any of those protein shakes or whatever to drink after that hour? Would there be any benefits for my goal, which is dropping weight? Or, should I just stick with water?2. May be unrelated to the topic of the thread. Does anyone have suggestions about vitamin supplements for men? I figure since I am trying to take better care of myself, I may as well look into it. Also, a body that is getting everything that it needs may be more amicable to losing fat (well, it makes sense in my head).

Or, should I just stick with water?Some people say always refuel after cardio, some people say wait awhile for optimum calorie burn. What I do is just go by feel. If I feel my workout that day was exceptionally rough, and my body is broken down, then I refuel right away, and be sure to eat a hearty meal afterwards. If I feel my workout was decent, but not too tough, and I'm not hungry, I tend to just let it go, and eat whenever my next meal is. Case in point, Monday I had a horrendous 12 mile run. I was overheating, undernourished (poor prep by me), and cramping up. After that, I made sure to pound a protein drink, and eat a giant (but healthy!) dinner soon afterwards. Today, I had a great 12 mile run. I finished relatively fresh, still with some gas in the tank, my body feels good. It's been 3 hours since my run finished, and I'm about ready to make dinner now.secretknight42 wrote:2. May be unrelated to the topic of the thread.

Also, a body that is getting everything that it needs may be more amicable to losing fat (well, it makes sense in my head).In a previous life, I used to take tons of stuff. All kinds of stuff. When I started running I just used a multivitamin and occasionally some random stuff like a B complex, zinc, etc. Eventually through forgetfulness, I now take nothing. I feel no different. For some people, a multivitamin, and certain supplements make a real difference in how they feel, but it doesn't have an effect on me. I regulate my portion sizes, but I still eat all kinds of stuff so I might be meeting my body's random nutritional needs that way.The unfortunate fact is that no one can tell you what you have to do to lose weight faster, other than watch what you eat (for whatever diet you're following), control your portion sizes, and get out there and break a sweat. Those are the only universal truths. My advice on the cardio + supplements, is do the cardio first, and get used to that. Once you're in the rhythm of constant workouts, and you know your body and it's performance characteristics, then add in one thing at a time. If after a few months, you throw in a B complex and all of a sudden you're 10% faster, then congratulations! You found something that works for you. If you you do everything all at once, then there's too many variables, and you don't know what's really working for you. Is it the vitmain? Is it the protein drink? Is it just the cardio and you don't need any of that? Some people get lucky and find the perfect combination of things for THEIR body right off the bat. The rest of us have to stumble around and experiment. You are a mythbuster for your own body.

If you have insurance and it covers well visits, go to your doctor's office ask for a complete blood workup. If anything is low supplement to bring it back in line. While you're supplementing, find out what's deficient in your diet/lifestyle and work to correct it so that when you're done supplementing you don't go deficient again.

Replace is probably a bad word, but replenish would be more like it. If you exhaust your stores and don't replenish, it makes recovery more difficult and can cause performance issues.

When you get sloppy you get hurt. Don't get hurt.

Well, I made it under 300lbs for my 40th birthday. Official weigh-in was 298.6lbs. Now to keep marching onward!

Leave for long-weekend vacation - 210Come home - 208Two year total = 61 lbs lost. I like to imagine it as things I'd have to carry around. So a 50 lb bag of rice, two bags of sugar, and a pint of beer.

Down to 191 this morning, mostly due to working through too many meals. Glad I didn't buy too many new clothes.Fin

I have a two-pronged problem... my scale broke, and I've been lazy about tracking calories. The scale was a withings scale. I loved it, but I was not happy with their customer service when it broke. It's also going to be rather pricey to replace. I should probably be annoyed that a $150 scale broke after 3 years, but my husband tripped over it more than once, so I don't blame the poor thing for breaking. I've also been bad (terrible) about tracking calories. I tend to get to a point where I'm burnt out on doing it, and I'm at that point.My saving grace is that I'm currently in "you have no idea what your weight is doing, so no slip-ups" mode. I'm not letting myself eat any junk and I've been really mindful about not snacking too much and eating smaller portions. For shortish periods of time, this actually tends to work really well for me.I have a coupon for $40/off a new scale, so I think I'm going to order myself a new one. I know I can get the same info from a $20 scale, but I really like the accountability I get with the withings.

I get in the biggest trouble when I 1) Don't track my weight, 2) Don't track my calories. This completely solves #1 for me.

Paging Godfather: % of body fat seems to not be working correctly. The graph shows a flat line, and the data pages show the same number for all data points.Hopers, I've found that staying good during the week and relaxing standards on the weekend is a good way to keep eating relatively under control. Normally I'm fairly strict on weekdays. On weekends I usually relax a bit on one day (a bit of bread for a breakfast sandwich? Fine!), and stop giving a fuck the other (I WILL EAT ANYTHING!). Makes social activities much easier, especially if you coordinate the fuck-all day with an unlimited mimosa brunch Hopers

I ended up buying the newer version of my withings scale. The OCD part of me wanted to keep everything on the same system, with the same historic trend. Vafarmboy, my basic strategy is careful eating on weekdays. Then, I have one weekend day where I mostly try to eat well, but I don't fuss about it too much. And one weekend day is a cheat day and I eat whatever I want. Which is basically your strategy as well. If I don't eat well during the week, I don't give myself the cheat day. It seems to work fairly well for me. It's also good to be able to say during the week "don't eat that now, you're going to have ice cream on Sunday." If we're planning something for the weekend that I know will involve a fair amount of pigging out, I make sure that's my cheat day as well. Turbo2

I used to carry this around on me all the time!
