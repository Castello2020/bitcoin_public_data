Thallium wrote:Isn't there an atmospheric processor on the planet by 2120? Maybe that's why it looks so much darker and more dismal in Alien; the processor is screwing with the atmosphere itself, causing storms, things like that.No. LV-426 is, according to dialog in Aliens, "an unsurveyed planet at that time" (where "that time" == Alien timeframe). The terraforming effort and the Hadley's Hope colony are established in the interstitial period between the two films.edited to add--If Prometheus does take place on LV-426, it brings up several interesting twists:* It's always been assumed that the reason the Nostromo is diverted to LV-426 to pick up the alien is because WY had previously intercepted the same transmission Dallas mentions at the beginning of Alien, and then arranged for the next available ship (the Nostromo) to pop down and check it out. If Prometheus takes place on LV-426, then WY has advanced knowledge of exactly what's down there.* It's always been assumed that the derelict is the source of the transmission. Indeed, the "Alien" novelization by Alan Dean Foster (based off of an earlier O'Bannon-heavy draft of the script prior to a lot of Giler's adjustments and Giger's alien design being finalized) has the crew actually locating the transmitter and shutting it off. However, it's possible that the transmitter isn't an alien transmitter at all--it's possible it's the distress beacon from the downed Prometheus warning everyone away, and MOTHER (or MU-TH-UR, take your pick) easily decodes it because it is in fact not alien in origin.* On the other hand, that's clearly a retcon, since scenes were shot in Alien showing the crew listening to the alien transmission and it is indeed very alien. At least five different variations of the audio were created, with one being featured on the original Aliens Collection DVD box set and a second one on the Quadrilogy and BluRay releases. The scene was cut, but it demonstrates that at least in 1978, the intent was that the signal be alien and not human.

Quote:One of those great research tidbits recently was that knowing a plotline makes people enjoy a movie more.That's bullshit for most stories. There's nothing like going into a movie (or book) with no foreknowledge and being completely blown away. It's rare these days, and something to be worked towards if at all possible. The Matrix, Fight Club, Inception, all of those wouldn't have been nearly as awesome if I had known all about them going in.If you already know roughly what happens, you spend the entire movie internally wondering "is this where ____ happens?" "what about now? no. Now?". That destroys the experience.

I happen to agree with you, but that's not what the research found. For some things, I don't care. For example, I've recently discovered the short-story collections of Sherlock Holmes books free on Kindle (highly recommended, BTW). I know that the case will be solved. There's no harm in knowing that, because that's just what he does. It's the *how* that is the story.On the other hand, when it comes to Prometheus, I'm not reading any of these spoilers until I have a chance to re-watch the first two movies .

It's ironic that prequels to movies from the 80s always look way newer than the films that allegedly took place "later" than it.

Advances in our own technology inform our vision of the future and if a prequel is written significantly after the original work *and* is supposed to be based in our reality, then it only makes sense to me to see what sometimes looks like more advanced tech in the prequels.Though the argument I've heard from some for Prometheus looking more advanced than anything we see in ships from Alien or Aliens is that this is the first *science* ship we've seen on screen, instead of a heavy freighter or a troop transport.

Exactly--Deviation got it. The Nostromo was a tug, towing a giant refinery. The Sulaco was a troop transport. While at least a certain amount of the fancy-futuristicness of Prometheus is going to be because the movie is newer, it's also got a lot to do with it being a privately-funded science expedition with the absolute highest of high-tech gizmos.

It actually doesn't bother me at all, I actually like how we can have more "realistic" visions of the future even if they take place in the "past".

So considering that the Alien graphic novels are non-canon, that leaves the motivations of the Space Jockey up in the air. Was the Space Jockey breeding the xenomorphs as weapons or perhaps trying to cull them to prevent their spread?

The Prometheus IMAX trailer has a few scenes not in either Trailer 1 or Trailer 2. Nice. I'm jazzed. I may need to take time off work to go see this in the morning of release.

Hah! I watched Alien last night too! Definitely enjoyed it. Was that the start of the "monster picks off one character at a time" trope that's so common in horror and action movies?

No, that one is incredibly common before Alien.In other news, has anyone been following the "Harry Knowles reviewed a fake Prometheus-script and wouldn't even believe Lindelof telling him it was fake"-drama over the last few days? The Fat Man is really fucking delusional these days, it's been hilarious to see how various online film critics and movie buffs have been raging at him. Genome

Scott's been a bit chatty about Prometheus in the last couple of days, a few minor spoilers (don't read if you want to go in completely clean, of course):
Spoiler: show
- Prometheus takes place on LV-223, not LV-426 (but they're in the same system).- Charlize Theron is a real company suit, I guess she's the Carter Burke of the story in that case. When everyone is waking up from cryo, she apparently just asks if anyone died, in a cold manner. She also doesn't react to the process like the others, who are throwing up and can barely stand. She's doing pushups and got out on her own, while the others need help from David. Could he be the known android and Vickers the corporate safety measure?- There's a scene involving Shaw that will be a callback to the chestburster scene. (Shaw in the medlab, I guess?)- The Derelict on LV-426 didn't crash, according to Scott. It landed there.

WY definitely knew and had figured out what was going on. The message beacon was a warning to stay away. It's been many years since I read it, so I don't remember if the xenomorphs were specifically mentioned, but I don't think so.

All other priorities are rescinded."They knew a life form was down there, and Ash may or may not have had knowledge not gained through observation of the thing on the Nostromo. His "perfect organism" speech shows that he's either been observing it diligently, or he knows more about the alien from outside sources.Still, I don't believe there's enough canonical evidence (i.e., evidence explicitly presented on-screen) that WY knows any more than that there's "a lifeform" on LV426. That's knowledge that likely would have been gained through translating the derelict's warning, but we simply aren't given enough information to know for sure. We have to speculate. Prometheus will potentially fix the speculation through retcon.

(spoilers/speculation follow)Interesting article with quotes here. The one that jumps out at me:Quote:The centrepiece of the alien set at Pinewood was a 32ft tall monolithic head, which can be glimpsed in posters for the film. This was built practically by Arthur Max’s team. “The idea there is that it’s part of the culture of the Engineers,” says Max of the race of aliens at the heart of the story. “This race of interplanetary visitors who have given us upgrades – mentally and physically – over the millennium.”I find this to be a great idea and one that I'm not sure I've ever seen in scifi. I mentioned before Larry Niven's Protector which is a novel about extra-terrestrial origination of life on Earth, but with humans as having arrived fully-formed to Earth from another planet. The big logical hole here is the history of evolution on Earth. Not a big deal for some (suspension of disbelief) but for me it ruined the story as it's scientifically ridiculous. Half of the fun of scifi is playing around with cool ideas. I guess this idea seemed fun in 1973, but in today's world where everyone knows something about biology and genetics it's pretty laughable.The story for Prometheus seems to be there is a race of spacefaring genetic engineers that discover Earth in the distant prehistoric past and find proto-man (homo erectus?) and give him some biological upgrades (better vocal chords? larger brain? bone structure for upright walking?) over time and eventually teach man the fundamentals of civilization, but then they leave (for some reason). I find the basic premise of that plot very satisfying and I hope it turns out as good as my expectations.If that is indeed the background story for the film then the title is a great one.

It's even more ominous when you consider Bishop's words in Aliens."That could never happen now with our new behavioral inhibitors. It is impossible for me to harm, or by omission of action, allow to be harmed, a human being."Their new behavioral inhibitors, which they only got around to installing some time between Alien & Aliens. So prior synthetics don't have them.Further, Ash's model from Alien--a Hyperdyne Systems model 120-A2--is a model known for being "a bit twitchy", where "twitchy" can include "murder if the circumstances require it."It's pretty clear we're not dealing with "Three Laws"-compliant androids here.

That is the idea is not "ancient aliens visited primordial Earth and seeded life" nor is it "ancient aliens came to Earth and gave early historical humans technology that enabled them to build pyramids, etc." instead it's "ancient aliens came to Earth and found higher apes that they tampered with genetically in subtle ways to form modern humans, and then left them to their own devices."I find the difference very satisfying from a scifi perspective.Some movies just grate me the wrong way, like The Matrix where the whole premise (harvesting humans for electrical power) is ridiculous. If a movie makes an effort to have scifi ideas I like them to be logical, either that or leave it fantastical or unexplained.

Do we know that David is the same series as Ash? Maybe David didn't harm, but they got over confident and didn't include restrictions in Ash's model.

Ash was a "Hyperdyne Systems model 120-A2" from the 2120s. David is a Weyland Industries Series 8 from 50-ish years prior. Different company (though "Hyperdyne Systems" might be a W-Y subsidiary).
