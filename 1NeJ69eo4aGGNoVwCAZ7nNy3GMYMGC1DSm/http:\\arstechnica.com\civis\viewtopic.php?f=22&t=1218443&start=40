Spoiler: show
While angered all (most?) gold cookies turn to red cookies and can have negative effects. It's not anything to worry about if you're going the full automation route.Also the news headlines get a bit crazier as the matriarchs make their anger known.
Long winded but spoilery tactics about end-game cookie production and phases of the game follows.
Spoiler: show
As you progress through the Grandmapocalypse, the proportion of red cookies to gold cookies goes from 1/3 to 2/3 to 100% red. The reds on *average* are a net positive, and can help you with overall number of cookies clicked-- the chains show up more often-- but you hit a point where reds are no longer desirable because they're not positive *enough* on average. Also the risky negative outcomes get to be very painful."Appeased" (achieved by one of two ways) results in going back to 100% golden cookies.The highest likely outcome on red cookies is either the 10% or what you'd make in 20 minutes of racking up cookies *or* ~7.4 Trillion from a chain that goes all the way to the end. The 666x buff is nice (especially with 2x duration), but not common enough, and you can't stack it with another red cookie. That's counter-balanced by the Clot outcome, which *really* hurts once you have double duration golden cookies, and the risk of losing 5% looms all the time. So when you get to the point when 7 trillion is not a lot of cookies (and at some point it's not) you really need to put yourself back into the appeased state so you can only get golden cookies.It's possible to come out ahead when you're getting both red and gold cookies, but as you progress, to all red, you'll outgrow the benefits of the red cookies and eventually need to go back to some flavor of appeasement.There are no negative outcomes from a golden cookie. Once you get the extended cookie duration, stacking a 7x Frenzy with a "Lucky" cookie is an important tactic for end-game income. (Just keep cookie balances above the minimums.)Stacking a 7x frenzy with a 777x click frenzy is rare but HOLY COW awesome of an outcome.Note that stacking 2 reds is basically impossible, and that stacking mechanic is really, really key.

How much does the 100th antimatter condenser cost?I am currently at 84 and trying to decide if I am going to stick with this long enough to get that last achievement. I get the feeling it could be several more days just to get that amount due to the way the numbers scale at the very end.

why did I ever click on this thread. I am now getting ~16M cookies/sec but I plan on leaving it up over night so I should have a very nice amount of cookies come morning to buy whatever I want some things.

Yes, you need to work the multipliers in your favor, *and* take advantage of all of the golden cookie strategies.If you're at 300% bonus or so (about 150 heavenly chips) it's going to probably be faster to do a reset. You get back to where you were shockingly fast...Edit: resetting a 10-day long game took me right about at 1 day to achieve the same CPS rate. I did so with a 528% bonus though. I expect to at *least* double my CPS rate by end game.

So what exactly are Heavenly chips? I'm on my first game about 5 days in. I'm at about 6B base cookies a second with everything at 100 except for Time Machines and Antimatter. The cheat info says I have like 30 Max Heavenly Cookies and no current.Do I need to wipe and restart to start getting cookied?

*sigh* that's what I figured. I have about 12 quadrillion lifetime right now, and 90 antimatter condensers. Those last 10 sure take a bunch of cookies, though.

If you want to exploit "Lucky Frenzies" you can keep going without a reset. Or, you can reset, and likely will win at about the same time, but end up with a little more momentum if you want to keep going for the lolz/boost your game up before dungeons come out.If you're doing it "right" the last 2 will happen at almost exactly the same time. For the last 10-20 condensers, you want to keep enough in your "account" to get the fully "Lucky Frenzy." If you don't care anymore once you hit 100, you can just buy the 99th and then spend down your surplus to zero to buy #100. That should be fairly quick.

Each heavenly chip equates to a 2% bonus on reset-- this is your prestige percentage and it stacks with the main bonus and the milk bonus.If you have 30 max, that means that of all the games you've ever played (this one) the total you have is 30. They *do* continue across games, so you don't have to reset and then wait until you get at 31 HC's. It'll start counting at 31.The current (CUR) number is the bonus being applied this particular game. It's 0 because you're on the first game and haven't done a reset.Clear so far?30 HC's equates to a 60% bonus. That's nothing to sneeze at, but I'd wait until you have maybe 100+ HC's before the reset and certainly you could go higher if you want. I reset recently for the first time with 264, giving me a 528% bonus to the entire next game.

I'm questioning if I even need any other games, and I've only been playing for a half hour. Doing nothing I'm at 283.9 cookies per second, but I'm sure that's a weak score. I did a lot of clicking before I realized that I needed to try to not click so much, but I am not a smart man.

Just got my last Condenser after about 3 days. Currently at 25.408b per second and 52.379 Quadrillion all time baked. Got a 77x Frenzy and a 777x stack and just skyrocketed to my last couple Condensers after I got home from work.Getting my last achievement (5 more pledge purchases) then probably resetting with 326 chips.

Also, if you are running the cheat code be sure to turn on the sound on golden cookie. That make it a lot easier to catch them. Once I got all 3 Cookie bonuses, my normal Frenzy lasts 154 seconds.

Do golden cookie clicks reset as well or do they keep count?

I've been mostly trying to avoid spoilers (so I've skipped most of the thread), but I'm getting bored with this. I have over 200 pointers, and over 100 of everything but time machines and antimatter condensers. I DIDN'T get the Elder Pact, which obviously has stopped all future research. The only other things available to me are production multipliers, and it's taking ~8 hours to get each of those. I currently have a multiplier of 675% and about 4.7 billion cookies per second. What can I do to either get more achievements or make the game more interesting at this point? Is reset or Elder Pact the only real choices, other than grinding up the Time Machines and Antimatter Condensers?

Spoiler: show
And while it's nice to get up to the 777 click achievement, there's a hidden achievement for 7777 Golden Cookie clicks (!?!). That achievement doesn't give you any bonus percentage though, like the other hidden achievements.

What can I do to either get more achievements or make the game more interesting at this point? Is reset or Elder Pact the only real choices, other than grinding up the Time Machines and Antimatter Condensers?In general: If you're only doing ~5bbn/sec, it sounds like you want to concentrate on multipliers, and may benefit from using the advanced mode that helps show the greater detail on what's going on to help you optimize better.You should also be buying upgrades as they make sense to do so. Some upgrades get unlocked once you have a certain number of structures (usually 50) and then all of the pre-requisites in place-- like buying the preceeding level of the same upgrade may unlock more.Regarding Elder Pact:
Spoiler: show
Once you get all of the obvious upgrades then choosing Elder Pact is a decision you'll probably want to make. At some point the 5% penalty will be massively overshadowed by the need to get Golden Cookies and the fact that the cookies brought in by Red Cookies become mostly chump change.
Regarding Achievements:
Spoiler: show
Every achievement is doable and each achievement gives you a bonus percentage that stacks with the main percentage, based off of how many cat workers you have. Getting to the 4th cat is a chore, but it typically *doubles* your CPS rate. Every achievement is do-able on the first playthrough except for 4, each of which relate to how many cookies (all time) you have at the point of reset. If you reset the game with >1 quadrillion (all time) then you unlock all 4 simultaneously. There are achievements for 100 Antimatter condensers, and 100 of everything, in addition to a few more that are difficult that you MAY want to reset before you try to attain. The 2nd playthrough goes MUCH faster.There are also two "think out of the box" achievements that you could easily do right now. Combine upgrades and achievements and that should rack up the cookie rate significantly
The last spoiler regarding making cookies faster isn't really a spoiler so much as a strategy for late game, so I won't tag it.Golden Cookies are VERY helpful, and one reason to call for an Elder Pact if you're stuck with just Red Cookies and want Golden Cookies back. If nothing else, try to stay above the level of cookies for the maximum "Lucky" bonus, and try to click on them frequently. Getting the upgrade that makes cookie effects last twice as long is the next step-- that lets you stack bonuses frequently and you then want to try to keep enough in your bank to get the maximum lucky frenzy. Yes, that takes time... but it's worth it. For example, I'm at ~28 billion/sec. A "Lucky" Golden cookie is a very likely outcome, as is the 7x Frenzy bonus. (The actual percentages are probably spoiler-y, but let's say "common.") First, get a double-duration 7x Frenzy bonus... most of the time that Frenzy bonus will still be active when the next golden cookie pops. Then click it and hope for a Lucky in order to get the "Lucky Frenzy." Right now, for me that's 240 trillion. Worst case would be a non-stacking 7x Frenzy or a plain old "Lucky" cookie (at 35 trillion, that's still nothing to scoff at.) If I'm really lucky, I can stack a 7x Frenzy with a 777x click bonus. That's when things get really nutty, but they are rare. If you do happen to pull that combo, you're looking at perhaps a quadrillion or more in under 30 seconds, depending on your base CPS...

I can't seem to catch a golden cookie to save my life - I've managed to hit only three over two days; I don't know how I'm missing them. They're guaranteed to show up in the visible window, right? I don't have to keep scrolling up and down each column just in case it appears off-screen?

I have answered my own question: the golden cookie is not guaranteed to show up in the visible window. Verified by watching the window intently and periodically running "alert(Game.missedGoldenClicks+" missed golden cookies")" until either I saw a golden cookie or the counter ticked up.The counter ticked up first.This is unfortunate.

They do fade away, though, lasting maybe 13 seconds (though you can double and then quadruple this with upgrades), and appear every 5-14 minutes, so the duty cycle is kind of small (though again, those same upgrades make half and then quarter the delay between cookies).EDIT: Huh. Never happened to me, ever, on IE or Chrome.

I have found a particularly high number of times where I have had the window in the background and returned to it to have a Golden Cookie show up within seconds of having done so. I very strongly suspect that it knows when the window is active.It is especially notable when I go to my Firefox instance, get the golden cookie, then go to my Chrome instance and get the golden cookie.

There should be a special achievement for that --Helpful post: I've rarely seen a bug on Chrome where the golden cookies don't show up, but their timer does (the numbers superimposed over the cookie). Typically this is after a game update but before you refresh the window. Worst case, just save and reload your browser window. Even in this case, they're still clickable, it's just annoying.

It *does* automate a lot of the stuff you'd either have to estimate or calculate by hand, but it's VERY helpful once you understand the base game.It also has lots of settings that are just nice to haves.The only thing that's arguably an actual cheat is to show the timer to next golden cookie and alerts (screen flash, optional noise and a countdown timer in the browser tab.)

The bonuses you get along continuing the research are well worth any penalties, and the penalties can be temporarily or permanently reversed (some achievements require you to do both).

I picked up a x777 per click plus a x7 frenzy. They were running combined at 26 seconds. It combined to give me 6 Quadrillion cookies in that 26 seconds.I'm now somewhere around 300billion cookies/second most of the time, and about every 4th golden cookie gets me several hundred trillion cookies.

Once I hit 500CPS my work computer starts dropping to its knees.I don't know if I should be disappointed, or relieved.

I'm >52 billion CPS on average with a Lucky Frenzy of 440 Trillion. I have pulled three Frenzy/Click Frenzy combos thus far in the game. They're epic when they happen-- the last one was just a hair over 2 Quadrillion for me.
