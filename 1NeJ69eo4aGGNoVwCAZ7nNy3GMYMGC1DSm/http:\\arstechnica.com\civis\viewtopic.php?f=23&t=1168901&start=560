Been catching up nfl news as of late. A few thoughts:Why the fuck is Wes Welker bitching about not getting a long term deal when he just got payed 9.5M the day prior? Not to mention his previous deals. Or his marketability. He's still young. The deal he's looking for would pay the franchise tag annually anyway. Contracts are essentially one year deals too. Am I missing something? Just seems like an utter dick move to complain after getting paid. Colt McCoySucks that you're being blamed for a lack of surrounding cast. Keep your head up and play well. It's not like a towering 29 year-old rookie would fare much better in the AFC north. MiamiYou guys are screwed. Sorry to see it. You whiffed in every possible way this off-season. The NFC North may be the hottest division in the game this year barring Calvin Johnson's Madden Curse. Ron Mexico (because fuck you still douchefag)Cam Newton is who you've tried to be your whole career. Watch and learn as he takes the league by force this year. The Eagles aren't climbing out of the cellar yet. TebowYou're a good guy and a helluva athlete. But when your teammates ask you to baptize them, it's a nice gesture, but they're asking for the wrong reasons. You can't save everyone; you should be asking Payton Manning to baptize your mechanics. Mark Sanchez is an afterthought come week 4. Get ready.

Welker wants a multi-year deal. They hit him with a franchise tag, which is the one year $9.5mil you speak of. After he signed it in good faith and started participating in offseason, apparently the multi-year offer the Pats had on the table dropped.Also, the headline sounded like Welker was whining, but if you read the quote, it is delivered in a more matter-of-fact cooperating with the press manner. I'm no Welker fan, but he actually seems to be in the right here.

Quote:Contracts are essentially one year deals too. Am I missing something?Contracts can front-load a lot of money - a 10 year, $100 million deal might be worth $50 mil in the first 2 or 3 years, not in the first 5.Quote:TebowYou're a good guy and a helluva athlete. But when your teammates ask you to baptize them, it's a nice gesture, but they're asking for the wrong reasons. You can't save everyone; you should be asking Payton Manning to baptize your mechanics. Mark Sanchez is an afterthought come week 4. Get ready. I think you mean, the Jets are an afterthought come week 4. You're right, the spotlight is on and the moment Sanchez struggles they'll be pushed by the public to put Tebow in and they will undoubtedly fold. At which point the whole team is doomed. Tebow getting his ass kicked by the Patriots, again, might be the best thing that Sanchez could hope for. Not that, if we follow your timeline, SF, Houston or Indy are going to be much kinder to him.

^^^As a Jets fan, I pretty much agree 100% with this prediction, unfortunately. I think that jumping on the Tebow train will likely turn out to be a bad mistake. It almost doesn't matter how good or bad he is, just having Tebow on the roster puts pressure on Sanchez, pressure that I reckon is much more likely to make him play worse than better.

In other news, Jonathan Vilma is now suing Roger Goodell for Defamantion.Quote:Suspended Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma filed a defamation lawsuit Thursday against NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, claiming the league's top executive made false statements that tarnished Vilma's reputation and hindered his ability to earn a living playing football."Commissioner Goodell opted to make very public and unfortunately erroneous allegations against Jonathan," said Vilma's attorney, Peter Ginsberg. "By making these false and public statements, he has significantly harmed Jonathan's reputation and ability to make a living."By suing Commissioner Goodell in court, Jonathan opted to use a fair playing field where he has procedural rights and protections to remedy the harm Commissioner Goodell has done to him."Now, Vilma cannot sue Goddell over the suspension because that is covered by the CBA.It's almost an impossible case to prove because he would have to demonstrate that not only is Goodell is factually incorrect but that he did it with reckless malice. Vilma falls into the Public Figure category which make it VERY difficult to prove defamation.That said, he hope this comes to court if only to force the NFL to actually show it's evidence. Goodell announced his punishments without every showing the evidence it was based on.

The latter is trivial to prove in Vilma's case, so the key will be what specific statements he's alleging as defamatory and whether or not they were true.Or he may not even care about winning. He may only be doing this as method of forcing the currently secret rationale behind the suspensions into the public eye. Either way, entertainment++ ronelson

It's okay, Urlacher is looking at free agency. I'm sure the Bears will bury him in money, but there's a tiny chance that he might leave the NFC North. That can only be good for you.

Of course if you are getting tagged you are a good player and the team is admitting to that.Unless the person in question is a QB, they can be pissy about hold outs more than other players, which is funny because in general your QB is your most taken care of player when they are good. Unless you are NO and just want to piss on all the good feelings you managed to generate in the last few years with one spectacularly bad season where you do everything wrong.

Somewhat old news (i.e. a couple of weeks ago), but I don't think it was mentioned here: Players' union sues NFL over alleged secret salary capQuote:The NFL Players Assn. has accused the NFL of putting a secret salary cap in place in the uncapped 2010 season — a violation of antitrust laws — and is seeking monetary damages that could climb into the billions.The union filed suit against the league Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Minnesota, accusing the NFL of collusion for conspiring to set a $123-million cap for 2010, when owners would have required the consent of players to do so.The NFL flatly denied the claim.Could this have ramifications for the 2012/13 season? Could this be the first card played by the NFLPA this season in the great poker game that is behind-the-scenes NFL shenanigans?---And in other news, apparently Terrell Owens can't even hold down a job in the Indoor Football League.Quote:Owens is the NFL's second all-time leader in receiving yards, but after burning one bridge after another in the league, he cannot find a team willing to use a roster spot on him. And now he cannot even hold a job in the Indoor Football League.In a statement released Tuesday, the Allen (Texas) Wranglers announced that Owens had been cut from the team and would lose his ownership stake in the franchise as well. Wranglers owner Jon Frankel cited Owens' refusal to play in two upcoming road games with possible playoff implications, as well as his no-show for a scheduled appearance at a local children's hospital, as reasons for the dismissal.Dude, you should've just retired after the Bengals.

Could this be the first card played by the NFLPA this season in the great poker game that is behind-the-scenes NFL shenanigans?Considering the fact that the Cowboys and Redskins were punished for front loading contracts during the uncapped season, the NFL has already admitted to a secret "unofficial" but actually official salary cap. The NFLPA has every right to sue. There was an uncapped year, but there was a not to secret agreement that no team would use the opportunity to outspend everyone else. Ignorning the agreement, the Cowboys frontloaded a portion of receiever Mike Austin's contract during that first year. It allowed them to lesson the cap impact over the remaining years. The Commish punished the Cowboys by fining them cap space, equal to what Austin's contract would have been had it been spaced out. The Redskins had similar deals.The teams appealed but were denied.

"Unwritten rules"?Fuck that.If you have a good player you want to keep on your roster, try keeping him on your roster. Otherwise, don't be surprised if someone swoops in and takes him, especially a coach who is infamous for signing free-agents and signing players off waivers.

The Giants were stupid because not only did they put him on waivers, they stated that they were going to re-sign him if he cleared waivers. It's just giving extra incentive to other teams to grab him if they had any interest at all. From the Patriots point of view they certainly use TEs a lot and they also just gained someone they can ask the question of, "What holes did you see in our defense when you played against us in the Super Bowl?"

Surely he has less insight than a defensive player, or even just watching the film.

Why would anyone think there are unwritten rules about claiming someone on waivers? Not only does that make no sense (the whole point of waivers is for other teams to claim the players), but it might well be illegal for teams to have a secret agreement not to claim players. Companies aren't allowed to collude about not hiring each others' employees.

That's where the insight comes in. It doesn't even matter that he didn't do much in the game, it's what they found to plan for while studying the defense that could help.

Well in a move that should have surprised nobody... Roger Goodell thinks that Roger Goodell is an excellent judge of character, a fair judge in general, and was spot on in his ruling on the Saint's Bounty Penalty. If asked to comment I'm sure Roger Goodell would say that the NFL is in good hands with Roger Goodell at the leader and furthermore Roger Goodell would like to buy Roger Goodell a beer for all of his hard work if Roger Goodell ever has a free moment from Roger Goodell's busy schedule.

I'm actually pretty excited that the NFL is finally going to offer the ability to watch "coaches film" of games, a view of all 22 players rather than just the television cameras. It's $69 for the season, but I'm very likely going to do it.

Only $69, on top of the (IIRC) $320 for Sunday Pass. I kind of want to get it, but I barely have time to watch the games, much less additional film of the games. If I find that it gives me access to the coaches films until opening day of the next season, maybe it will be more interesting, since I'll find time during the offseason to watch it.

So that's not opening day, but it's not bad. I don't have the option of Sunday Pass so I'm pretty sure I'm going to get it.

It was pretty good last year, if they make the DVR functionality a little smoother it will be almost perfect (lack of a 2nd 'tuner' to have DVR functionality on two games you flip back and forth on, specifically).

From what I read, it sounds like an off-duty police officer asked him to leave for the second time and AP shoved him in the shoulder, saying, "I heard you the first time!" or something. At that point the cops tried to arrest him. Apparently he resisted. I'd understand arresting a guy for shoving an on-duty cop, but for just shoving some civilian in the shoulder who happens to be a cop, it seems a bit over the top. Then again, I wasn't there. Then again, we know how defensive cops are about each other. Meh. I guess we'll find out.Anyway, one article I read said it was a misdemeanor. At least they aren't charging him with assault or something.
