Judging by the mailbox on the ground and the like, someone (I'm guessing the boy) was driving and ended up taking out the mailbox. So they took a pic for insurance purposes and the parents made sure to embarass their child by making it look like a family photo.At least that's my take on it. E: Maybe not, they don't look old enough to be the parents.

Still can't make sense of how the front tire is sunk into the ground. Overall, having your teen get into a hilarious 'accident' like that and taking that photos is A+

Mailbox was planted into the ground in a huge chunk of concrete. Teenager driven car backs up, hits mailbox, and ripping out the chunk of concrete with it. Front tire of car then rests in the hole where the huge chunk of concrete used to sit. Parents are acting like the parents that I want to be some day.

The driver also clearly spent time futilely trying to drive the stuck car out of the hole.

If you can see this then your DNS likes my new host. We called Cincinnati Bell Friday night about the outage, and they didn't really give a shit and said Monday morning. No internet or home phone all weekend. This on top of them just raising the price of my static IP address from $5 to $10. Fuck these guys! I'm going to dump them as much as I can. My phone contract is almost done. I have to keep a very basic home line for my security system. I'm going to drop them for cable internet soon. I hadn't before because cable doesn't offer static IPs. So now I am switched to a host that is $5 a month, the same as my old static price. All Cincinnati Bell is going to get is a cheap home phone and my wife's 1.5 year contract left Android.
