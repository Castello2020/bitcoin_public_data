Reactions that are otherwise impossible become more likely as temperatures drop.Read the whole story

Quote:and a hydroxyl radical. The latter is a water molecule with one of the hydrogens stripped away, but having left its electron behind, it's water without a proton, in effectNope, that's an ion - a rather common one, as it happens. A hydroxyl radical is water minus the entire hydrogen atom, so the oxygen has an unpaired electron.

Small correction:Water with one proton missing (leaving its electron behind) that would be a negativly charged hydroxide ion. Water with one hydrogen missing, including the electron, that would be a hydroxyl radical. It has no charge but a highly reactive unpaired electron. Greetings from rainy Berlin

We seem to be in need of better language. 'reaction' is used in different ways, exclusive of and inclusive of quantum tunneling.

So the panspermia theory gains some traction, due to the common chemistry that takes place in the cold vastness of space?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia

I'd be interested to know what the probability of productive collision (i.e. the right orientation for H-bonding) between two methanol molecules in an interstellar gas cloud is.

Panspermia is a bad theory for another reason: it just shifts the problem. The question of importance isn't "How did life on earth arise?" but "How did life arise?" and panspermia theories only give an answer to the first, not the second.

Check the second sentence after the one you corrected--if it just transfers a proton then you end up with a methoxide ion and a radical cation with the formula H2O+.Edit: Also, typo in the Nature abstract--there is no -200K, so I'm not sure whether they meant 200K or -200ºC.Second edit: NM, that's a tilde. They really should use a font that doesn't make it look like a negative sign, though.

It could be on anything that could form into a planet (leaving it intentionally vague to not have to mention asteroids, moons, stars, et cetera in a list). If we assume that your "planet" definition is correct, then the "ripped apart" postulation becomes flawed. It would merely need to be ejected from a planet. This can occur from an external source (an impact event) or an internal source (a volcanic event) both of which are highly likely to occur. Hell, we have Martian meteorites on Earth. Mars might have Terran meteorites.

Hell, a non-active body flying through space would be able pick up ingredients for life mentioned in the article via the creation method in the article and have enough energy to make those ingredients into more complex ingredients.Panspermia doesn't require life to be created in the short span of hundreds of thousands of years. Anywho, if it did, a nearly 14 billion year old universe had tens of thousands of hundreds of thousands year periods.

I'm also horrified at the idea that life can only be created and evolve in a closed system as required by your C.

Everything I've ever heard of quantum tunneling described it as electrons that tunnel thru from one orbital to another (thereby switching which molecule it is associated with). That's all well and good for getting the electron out of the original water molecule. So how does the proton leave so a hydroxyl radical is left behind?

Maybe I missed it in this article, and can only see the abstract of the paper, but was this work done in a laboratory, or is it all theoretical? The wording implies the former, but it's not explicitly spelled out anywhere.

Could we use this type of low temperature quantum chemical reaction in our industrial chemistry?It is ever more energetically favorable when bulk producing some of these chemicals to lower the temperature and take advantage of quantum tunneling instead of raising the temperature?Are there any compounds that are very difficult or un-economical to create that become economical using low temperature quantum tunneling chemistry?Wish the paper authors had tried to answer some of those questions.

Besides, you need a lot of energy and nontrivial instrumentation to reach very low temperatures in a closed system

So much so that even the incredibly long odds of surviving orbital transfer wouldn't be limiting as eventually something would survive. Again lets be clear i don't support the theory, in this form nore especially in the bastardize mars to earth please continue our funding degenerate form that nasa's been pushing lately.

Quote:Methanol has four hydrogens, but the regular chemical reaction favors the transfer of specific ones when forming the water molecule.Shouldn't this say "a specific one"? The 3 hydrogen atoms bonded to the carbon are all geometrically equivalent. The single H in the hydroxyl group is the one being transferred if a methoxy radical is left after reaction.

I can't access the article, but Fig. 1 seems to show that the activation energy for making •CH2OH is lower than for making CH3O•. If the reaction is kinetically controlled, then •CH2OH would be the product. Still, all those H's are equivalent.I'm not sure that I understand the tunneling that's proposed. The hydrogen-bound species are HO• and methanol. Hence, a proton tunneling to the unoccupied space creates H-O-H+, with a singly occupied O-H bond. An electron can then move to fill that orbital. However, the proton seems to have landed in a much higher energy state before the arrival of the electron. Also, I imagine that it's possible to calculate the possible geometries of the H-bound states to estimate the distance of tunneling, which should be related to the tunneling barrier.

The single H in the hydroxyl group is the one being transferred if a methoxy radical is left after reaction.It is not quite true to say that the three hydrogens bonded to the carbon are equivalent (although we cannot tell them apart -- especially from here!). While statements that they are equivalent are common simplifications, those hydrogens are in different positions relative to the hydrogen bonded to the oxygen, which will affect their relative reactivity. At 63 K the rotation about the C-O bond is considerably reduced compared to what is observed at 298 K. This is probably even more profoundly true if a hydrogen bond has formed between the methanol -OH and the hydroxyl radical.

There has been a lot of discussion about Panspermia; notice that the original article did not have anything to do with planets.With all this chemistry, mitigated by a quite different mechanism from planetary chemistry, why not speculate about strange new life forms that are created in the interstellar void? It does not seem any weirder than life forming on a planet (god botherer's aside).There has, of course, already been a lot of speculation in SF.Steve

Actually I meant something different. I don't mean planetary life origins, I'm thinking about completely unknown sorts of life that the quantum chemistry may empower. There would be some initial problems with the question of what we mean by life, and whether we can recognize it in our limited time frame.Again, this is nothing original on my part, but I am interested to see a plausible mechanism for active chemistry. Before I read this, huge clouds of hydroxyl ions were very vague and just clouds; now it sounds like there is possibly a lot more going on.

The Thread in the Pern stories evolved in the Oort cloud, not on the Red Star (though there is no discussion of their evolution, only their current state...Anne was not really a "hard sci-fi" writer). And in the Xeelee sequence, life evolves in the quark-gluon plasma that existed for a few fractions of a second at the beginning of the universe, as well as other odd places. And if you specifically want to talk about gas clouds, there is an intelligent one in Iain M. Banks' "The Algebraist".

Simple: it couldn't, because there is no energy available.That our original paper precisely describes a quantum way to produce unlikely atoms in a cold environment doesn't prevent the need, for any life, to work (and evolve) from an energy source somewhere.No energy available = you just wait.Or then your definition of life involves a pace infinitely slower than ours...

Why is this paper titled "Chemical reactions etc."?The proposed mechanism involves a *nuclear* reaction, even it it is helped by a chemical bonding.Which is quite interesting indeed.It may even have applications on Earth, for all of these guys looking for, you know, cold fusion and all these sort of things.The only issue is, in order to obtain this kind of tunneling in more than 1% of the molecules, what is the delay? Eons, in space, which is affordable there? Or are hours and days reachable?
