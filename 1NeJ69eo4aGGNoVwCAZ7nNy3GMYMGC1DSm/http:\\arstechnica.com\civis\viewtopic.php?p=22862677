I don't understand how a hippie like that can have such good complexion, given that dreads aren't exactly the cleanest choice you can make with your hair.edit: Psygard, she's hiding a wookie in her pants. If you're looking to engage in some mental spelunking, I hope you bring a machete so you can find the entrance.

Yes, it is completely awesome, but I don't know how safe it is for day-to-day sparing.I'm guessing that was part of a choreographed demonstration or something. It just goes too well. Also, minus the fact that his face is now potentially in a leg lock of some sort, it doesn't look like the move accomplishes much more than looking cool.

Definitely choreographed; the guy's arm is down in preparation for his roll as soon as the girl starts spinning around his shoulders. If they were actually fighting, he'd have tried to dodge or escape the leglock.It looks pretty sweet though.

I'd estimate up to a 2:1 mass difference between the two, there are weight classes in most competitive martial athletics for a reason - at 2:1 the larger can just about hold the smaller at arm’s length by the scruff of the neck.

I always had to Judo wrestle with one of our instructors because, at the time, I was actually in good shape and was at least as big/heavy as any other student in the class (I could benchpress anyone in our class without much trouble, at the time).
