              I have been accepted to the University of Virginia. They have a <a href="http://www.seas.virginia.edu/acad/programs/producedinva/" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">remote learning program for Engineering Science</a>, specializing in EE/ME/Materials. My specialization would be Mechatronics. <br /><br />While their traditional Engineering programs are ABET accredited, this one is not, and likely will not be, as confirmed by the Director of the program. <br /><br />Now, what kind of risk am I taking if I go down this road and end up with a non-ABET degree? I live in SE Virginia, big Navy area, but there are lots of other employers as well.

              Well, I guess the first question is, &quot;Do you want to be an engineer?&quot; Obviously if you want to get a PE license at some point, then this isn't the school for you. But I think lots of other places that hire &quot;engineers&quot;, even without the PE license requirement, would balk at the non-ABET accreditation.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you're looking to work in some sort of field where you're not expected to be an engineer, but maybe more of a robotics/electronics guru, it might be reasonable to stay in that program.<br /><br />What sort of places are you thinking about working?

              On looking at the website for that program, I'm kind of horrified that it's so hard to find the accreditation information. I mean, I know that the guy told you that the program isn't accredited, but I was wondering which of their engineering programs *are* - and I couldn't even find that. Best I could do was one blurb next to the list of undergrad engineering programs (of which there are 10 or more) saying that they have 9 accredited programs. What a crappy way of disseminating information.

UVA is a real university, they have accreditation per the ABET site for all their traditional programs, specifically EE, CE, and ME. The program I am participating in is made up of classes from those accredited programs. The quality side is their.<br /><br />So, it is of your opinion that the ABET matters for many places? Most places even? <br /><br />There is a port here, a regional airport, etc. There are some manufacturing firms, but still, most shops are Navy contractors. The big guys mostly all have some presence. BAE is nearby, HP has contracts, Northrup Grunman.

              I have a little bit of experience in this actually. My degree is basically an engineering degree without the engineering accreditation and a slightly different class makeup.<br /><br />As has been said if you want a job with the title ME, EE, CE, etc. or want to get you PE, you will want to be in an accredited program.<br /><br />The lack of engineering accreditation did not significantly effect me because I have never really worked as an engineer. My career started in embedded systems software development in the late 1980's. My education was geared towards this, but it was not something you could get a degree in back in the 1980's. So while employers would have liked an engineering degree, they were just happy to get someone that knew what assembly language was, much less the fact that I used the exact same processor and development tools in school.<br /><br />I have since moved on to working in IT as a Administrator/DBA/Programmer where my schooling has little to do with the work I do.<br /><br />I have seen the lack of an accredited engineering degree adversely effect others however. Not so much in getting into some place, but in the ability to advance. I have seen a couple people passed over for positions with the word engineer in the title, even though they could design circles around the engineer that was hired.<br /><br />So think seriously about what kind of career and advancement opportunities you want. If you are going to be a &quot;maker&quot; working for yourself or working some start up the exact degree is not a big deal. If you want to work for a more traditional company and move up through the engineering ranks the degree and accreditation will make a difference.

              Even if you never plan to get your PE, I would stick with an acredited school. ABET acredidation will mean more than the school you got your degree from. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Pysgard wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I do indeed want to be an engineer. UVA is a real university, they have accreditation per the ABET site for all their traditional programs, specifically EE, CE, and ME. The program I am participating in is made up of classes from those accredited programs. The quality side is their.<br /><br />So, it is of your opinion that the ABET matters for many places? Most places even? <br /><br />There is a port here, a regional airport, etc. There are some manufacturing firms, but still, most shops are Navy contractors. The big guys mostly all have some presence. BAE is nearby, HP has contracts, Northrup Grunman.</div><br /><br />Those companies are most likely going to require ABET certification. The &quot;job&quot; may not require any actual real engineering, but I can almost guarantee you will need ABET to get your foot in the door if you apply for any position requiring an engineering degree. Doesn't matter how good the school is, if the program is not accredited your degree will be worth less. I'm not saying you won't be able to get an engineering job, but that first job will be a lot tougher to acquire. I could be wrong, but at the very least I would see what they require now. Pretend you are looking for a job and see what is needed.<br /><br />If you were already working as an engineer and were just trying to get a degree to back up your experience I'd be more positive, but you will be limiting your future prospects without the accredidation.<br /><br />I did a quick search at Northrop-Grumman and found this for EE level 1,<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">In order to be considered for this position, candidates must have completed their degree from an accredited college or university within the last twelve (12) months.

              I would not recommend doing a degree in Engineering Science/Physics unless you were 120% sure you were ready to commit to either a masters/PhD in a more traditional engineering field (at least by name, you'll be able to direct the study more to your liking) or a law degree looking to do patent law.

              I've been applying for a bunch of federal jobs lately (as a environmental engineer), and most jobs have had this standard degree requirement (check out <a href="http://www.usajobs.gov" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">http://www.usajobs.gov</a> or for that matter any corporate website if you want to check out random job requirements):<br /><br />&quot;A.  Degree: professional engineering. To be acceptable, the curriculum must: (1) be in a school of engineering with at least one curriculum accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) as a professional engineering curriculum; or (2) include differential and integral calculus and courses (more advanced than first-year physics and chemistry) in five of the following seven areas of engineering science or physics: (a) statics, dynamics; (b) strength of materials (stress-strain relationships); (c) fluid mechanics, hydraulics; (d) thermodynamics; (e) electrical fields and circuits; (f) nature and properties of materials (relating particle and aggregate structure to properties); and (g) any other comparable area of fundamental engineering science or physics, such as optics, heat transfer, soil mechanics, or electronics.&quot;<br /><br />So going with a non-ABET degree means that you'll still have doors open, but you have to be cognizant of the fact that it is going to close a lot of them too, as you won't be able to get a PE, which a lot of private sector engineering firms want you to be able to obtain within 2 years or so of you starting to work there.

              Yeah, the only people I know who got their PE's are civil engineers working on buildings/roads. For the majority of people it's not needed. If you plan on going into consulting which is what I think he was refering to, it might be more necessary.

              My bad, to clarify, I'm an environmental/civil engineer, and I've mainly dealt with infrastructure and remediation projects. So mostly consulting and government stuff where PEs are the norm, so I imagined the other engineering fields were like that. But that doesn't look to be the case, so it's like you other engineers are from another planet  <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/razz.png" alt=":p" title="Razz" />

              Why bother with an unaccredited program and one that by its own admission will never get such a thing?<br /><br />It's not like there's any lack of comparable schools that are accredited.<br /><br />I don't know how many employers check for that sort of thing, but if even 10 per cent do, it could include the outfit you really want to work for.<br /><br />Degrees follow you around for a long time.  I changed jobs twice in my 50s and the first thing I had to deal with in terms of the HR gauntlet was my degree transcripts.  My hiring manager didn't care half as much as HR, but in big companies, HR can <span style="font-style: italic">veto</span> if they don't like the answers they get.<br /><br />There's a lot of &quot;checkmark-ism&quot; especially at big companies.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I know who got their PE's are civil engineers working on buildings/roads<br /></div><br /><br />My brother is a mechanical engineer, and he got his PE.

              Does anyone know what accreditation does for grad school admissions?<br /><br />A PE is a nice discussion, but I got my Masters in my '40s, long after I <span style="font-style: italic">assumed</span> I was done with college.<br /><br />I would certainly hate to learn after the fact that not being accredited for my undergrad blackballed me from any (never mind many) grad schools.<br /><br />The other problem is, today's answer may not be enough.  Sometimes, these things ratchet up over time.<br /><br />Back when my wife was getting into Nursing, not having a bachelor's was no impediment to a fine career.  But, fast forward a couple of decades and now it is.  She no longer qualifies for jobs that her experience certainly qualifies her for.

              Huh. They have a PE for <a href="http://www.ncees.org/Documents/Public/Exam%20specifications/PE%20Ele%20Computer%20Apr%202009.pdf" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Computer Engineering</a>?<br /><br />Reading that list made me laugh, that's like a tiny subset of Computer Science taught here. Too bad you can't just sign up for that exam and walk out with the certificate, it doesn't even matter that it's open book, don't have or need it anyway.<br /><br />I guess CE is more focused on the engineering part than the computers one, but damn, the requirements. Basic computer science does not require working under a PE for 4 years, me thinks <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/big_grin.png" alt=":D" title="Big Green" />

              I did a little looking into info about the PE and basically since the licensing is regulated at the state level if you work on products that could be sold across state lines a PE license is not required. So it makes sense that the only people that seem to need them are those working civil engineering projects and construction sites/buildings.<br /><br />Still, as was pointed out earlier a lot of employers will have words in job requisitions that require a degree from an ABET accredited program. One problem with some of these types of curricula are that there's no lab time. That's not great for an engineering degree. Probably a major reason why it would not be accredited.

              Looking at the website linked by the OP, and their <a href="http://www.seas.virginia.edu/acad/programs/producedinva/engsci.php" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Engineering Science</a> page, this program seems to be an odd hybrid of basic core from community college classes, followed by a &quot;double minor&quot; of proper engineering courses from UVA, with some added specialization and a senior thesis-type project. While I kind of see what they're going for, and I think you could do just fine in a career based on that coursework, I don't actually see much advantage to be had there relative to what could be achieved within a conventional e.g. mechanical engineering program with appropriately-selected electives, and possibly a community-college transfer process if those cost vs. time tradeoffs were appealing. <br /><br /><br />Honestly the ABET accreditation process has always been a bit unclear to me. At my school the mechanical engineering degree had for decades been listed as a B.S. in &quot;Engineering and Applied Science&quot; with a concentration in mechanical engineering. This program was accredited. My senior year, they reshuffled some stuff in the course catalog and created a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, with the same coursework requirements as the previous program. This is the degree I received. However, since it was the first year of the program, technically the ABET accreditation process had not been completed at the time I received my degree... but maybe there's some kind of retroactive accreditation granted? I'm sure I could argue it successfully if it was challenged, but I've never been completely confident where it stands.<br /><br />As far as the PE licensing goes, the vast majority of the mechanical engineers I've worked with do not have one, and I don't really see a need for it in most trajectories I can see my career taking... though I would like to go through the process and get the license one of these years, just for its own sake. On the other hand, my wife works at a civil engineering consulting company, and with her Environmental <span style="font-weight: bold">Science</span> degrees she has been hampered in advancement somewhat, because of the way PE licensure is baked into the company's advancement policies and employee grade-level descriptions. Not all companies are like that, but it's a concern worth keeping in mind.

Thus you get licensed in state A and for a fee and a chunk of verification data, you can get a license in states B, C, and D as well. Thus we have old guys with licenses from seven different states on their wall (this mainly applies to the old onshore guys, as offshore design just requires a stamp from the state in which your firm is registered).<br /><br />/end derail<br /><br />For whatever it is worth, I'd second the advice calling for an ABET accredited degree; I interned at a defense contractor and was told &quot;lol, PE?&quot; time and again, but ended up in a different industry (I'm an ME). Just because you don't need one now doesn't mean you never will (particularly in a boom/bust industry like defense traditionally is).
