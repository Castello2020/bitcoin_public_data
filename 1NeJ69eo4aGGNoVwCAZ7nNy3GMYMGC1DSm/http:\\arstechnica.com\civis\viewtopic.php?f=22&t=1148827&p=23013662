              I personally am a fan of that reprint. I missed it last time, and now can acquire one with relative ease. $20 is way past what I'll ever pay for a single, and thats what Akroma's memorial was at IIRC.

Mox Saphire will be reprinted before Charge Across Araba.<br /><br /><img src="http://static.starcitygames.com/sales/cardscans/MAGSOK/charge_across_the_araba.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />1. Weird name specific to some place? <br />2. Arcane?<br />3. Sweep?<br /><br />Future Sight was showing potential futures. Maro has basically said we shouldn't expect to see anything again and should stop speculating every spoiler season about what fst card will show up and just be happy if Muraganda Petroglyphs shows up in Caveman Block or whatever.<br /><br />What does M13 have to do with Akroma? If they're trying to tell a story about their new Captains of Colors from Duals 13, why is it even relevant? WTF is an Akroma? It's not like 10th edition when they stuck in the Pit Fighter legends to try to tell that story. It's just a memorial to someone we didn't bother to explain what it was for. <br /><br />Since it's so random and doesn't feel meta-gamey, it just seems like they said &quot;Gee, commander players really like this and they hate paying for it but it's too nice to put in our packaged commander decks so lets just reprint it at a higher rarity like we did with Knight of the Reliquary (because that totally fucked people in limited games as it always attacked at 10/10 on turn 4 with all the fetch lands in Alara block!) and hope it helps the set sell a bit better.&quot;<br /><br />Am I for a reserve list? No. But I'm not for Wizards bullshitting about not playing with the secondary market when it's clear they tinker with it without bother to obfuscate.<br /><br />There are a lot of cards that feel cooler than they actually are and that's part of the reason I love magic. As soon as you put those cards into EVERYONE'S hands, everyone knows they're not cool at all. <br /><br />How many times has Juzam been functionally reprinted, like 4 times, 5? It was firmly established: not especially playable. Juzam is still cool as fuck though because we don't all have it. <br /><br />OTOH, all it took was one reprinting of Underworld Dreams (then $30) to show us all that it was fucking horrible and should be burned and banned from even being on xbox games.

Even if you didn't (yet) know who Akroma was, the flavor of the card is clear.  People often learn about these things by other players teaching them.<br /><br />Exposing players to the various names of Magic history is, by no means, specific to Akroma here. Many things go unexplained in every set, things which older players understand.  In M13: What is a Phyrexian? What is Nin? Mwonvuli? Ghave? Nissa? Koth? Mogg? Keldon? There are probably another 20.  <br /><br />Tossing in a few EDH staples also gives new players trade fodder with the more established players at prereleases and at FNM.  They're leveraging the secondary market to drive interest.  Reprinting two out of hundreds of valuable cards is not going to make a significant dent in anyone's livelihood.

It's just a memorial to someone we didn't bother to explain what it was for.</div><br /><br />This is part of the history of MTG, and a good part IMHO. I think they've actually gone way to far in explaining names and references. Part of the mystique of cards is they reference things that haven't been printed. I remember opening Revised and wondering &quot;Who is Urza? Who's Ith? How about Serra?&quot; It was a little teaser that the world of MTG was broader and vaster than just what was on the card, that there was a hidden backstory that belied a rich, new creative world to imagine. Mystery creates wonder. <br /><br />Then they started basically pulling back the curtain and printing the Gerrards and Karns and Urzas and all the other people referenced in cardnames and flavor text, and MTG lost a HUGE amount of it's flavorful feel when they started doing that. It became about a billion times less interesting. <br /><br />So complaining that they are doing something that actually used to make MTG cool seems a little ... odd. Akromas memorial would be about 10,000 times cooler is they never printed or told us what Akroma was. Mystery is cool. Referencing other printed cards is a creative cop out. Don't even get me started on the PW &quot;named&quot; creatures and spells.

              4-0d my prerelease today. Played a W/g deck, heavy on the exalted, with no real bombs. MVPs were probably Aven Squire, Odric's Crusader and Rancor. Played zero of my rares, just a solid aggro deck.<br /><br />Picked up a foil Phantasmal Image and foil Olivia for my cube.<br /><br />How did everyone else do?

              I went 3-1-1 (green/black aggro) and my girlfriend went 4-1 (black/white exalted).  She opened both Ajani AND Chandra!  I'm really liking this set.  Feels more fun than other core sets.  Saw huge diversity and I really don't know what the best decks are.  Despite my unusual pair of BG, I felt like I could win every game that wasn't hit too hard by mulligan, though I did pull out two mulls-to-6.  <br /><br />I also got to Naturalize a (roughly) 800/800 creature.  Can anyone figure out how?  <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/big_grin.png" alt=":D" title="Big Green" />

              Ah, you're probably right. Hydra is much more likely. I didn't see one yesterday, and had forgotten it had been reprinted.<br /><br />Also, I just flipped through my deck. I did play a rare, Trading Post. Just used it as a Forcefield, but it was pretty good at that.

              Well, do you want to play Lilana in the next year? How much are you really going to save by waiting a year? 20 bucks? Almost always, that's an easy value calculation for me.

              well, he naturalized it. i'm guessing a gorgon'd hydra. far less likely - a chronomoton on turn 804, with an elixir of immortality on both sides and a completely stalled board state. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/razz.png" alt=":p" title="Razz" /><br /><br />i played g/w non-exalted aggro and went 3-1, and the -1 was a loss in three. i had game three well in hand and he basically went, &quot;bomb rare, haste, i win.&quot; i hate that. ugh. fun aside - my r/u pool was so good that it served as my sideboard for matches that my 22-creature g/w deck couldn't handle. that was a fun surprise for opponents i went to game three with. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/wink.png" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />later, asmodan and i did a two headed giant event and played classically solid r/g and u/b decks. with how the draws went, it might as well have been no-bombs.dec. we got one bomb rare out the whole event, and that card just once. regardless, we cooked and served fried anus to everyone. no game was even close.<br /><br />this core set is markedly different from the last two i've done anything with. lots of flavor and interesting things going on. i loved rise, but this might be my favorite sealed event ever.<br /><br />final thought - slumbering dragon is the most effective rattlesnake i've ever seen. the &quot;do not fuck with me&quot; vibe he emits is unmistakable, and by himself, he held off ten of my guys because i couldn't swing for lethal in two consecutive attack phases. ho-lee christ. seriously, fuck that guy.<br /><br />--RC

              I went to two prereleases this weekend and had a lot of fun. I like this set a lot more than AVR and I can't wait until it's available online.<br /><br />What was everyone else's experience with the cycle of rings? I was underwhelmed when I saw them spoiled but after playing with them I'm a believer. The first day I played blue with the blue ring - having the ability to make a switched-on Jace's Phantasm hexproof (and grow it every turn for funsies) is awesome. The second day I had the green one one and it did some good work there too.<br /><br />Also, the second day I opened Vampire Nocturnus and Vampire Nighthawk. Needless to say, Nighthawk was an all-star and I tutored him up every game I played the Mwonvuli Beast Tracker.

It seems WAY to bomb dependant, even more so than other recent sets. There's more removal so it's better than AVR, but I wouldn't put it anywhere near as good as Rise was. I need to play it a bit more, it seems more fun than M12 and less fun than M11. Definitly more fun than SOM, MBS, ISD or DKA.<br /><br />Went 3-1 with what was literally my worst sealed pool EVAR. I got one rancor, and that was the best card out of 6 packs. My blue was completely unplayable, and then I had about 1/4th a decks worth of semi playables in R, W, G, and B. So I decided to have fun with it, I picked the 12 best cards in each of those 4 colors, got 8 of each land, and then before every match I rolled a 4 sided to randomly pick 2 colors and that was the deck I played for that match. <br /><br />I only went 3-1 becuase I played against a first time MTG player in R1, and then R2 &amp; R3 my opponnents got some of the most epic mana/color screw I've ever witnessed. I literally won a game swinging 10 times with a tormented soul and a duty bound dead on board, and never played another card. The only round I played against an actual deck where the guy didn't get screwed I was completely blown out, although I suspect he was cheating since it was his third prerelase in three days and he showed me his deck for this one and it had 3 nighthawk, 3 murders, a mutilate, 2 switcheroo's, 4 unsummons, a clone, 2 fog banks, 2 Talrands Invocations, and a sleep. So out of 18 uncommons, he just so happened to have 10 of them be amazing limited cards in UB, which also just so happens to be his favorite color combination to play. <br /><br /><br /><br />And the packs and boxes do look really cool. They should use black packaging on all sets from now on. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What was everyone else's experience with the cycle of rings?

I had great success holding off superior boards by using the ring to grow creatures big enough to beat something in combat, then moving it to the next candidate.  I was unimpressed with the white one mainly because white is so much about exalted, and vigilance is less important with exalted.  I never saw the red or green ones in play.

              Having played with the green one, I can vouch for it. I had the 4/4 vigilant reaching spider and the 5/6 wurm and when those were ringed up I was in good shape. If the ring was in my starting hand, playing and equipping it turn three to whatever green two-drop I had on the board was a good play too, since it makes the random dork bigger every turn.<br /><br />One of my opponents had the white ring on the 2/2 lifelink cat and that was scary. Having a vigilant lifelinker that grew was scary.

If they're trying to tell a story about their new Captains of Colors from Duals 13, why is it even relevant? WTF is an Akroma? It's not like 10th edition when they stuck in the Pit Fighter legends to try to tell that story. It's just a memorial to someone we didn't bother to explain what it was for.</div><br /><br />This is part of the history of MTG, and a good part IMHO. I think they've actually gone way to far in explaining names and references. Part of the mystique of cards is they reference things that haven't been printed. I remember opening Revised and wondering &quot;Who is Urza? Who's Ith? How about Serra?&quot; It was a little teaser that the world of MTG was broader and vaster than just what was on the card, that there was a hidden backstory that belied a rich, new creative world to imagine. Mystery creates wonder. <br /><br />Then they started basically pulling back the curtain and printing the Gerrards and Karns and Urzas and all the other people referenced in cardnames and flavor text, and MTG lost a HUGE amount of it's flavorful feel when they started doing that. It became about a billion times less interesting. <br /><br />So complaining that they are doing something that actually used to make MTG cool seems a little ... odd. Akromas memorial would be about 10,000 times cooler is they never printed or told us what Akroma was. Mystery is cool. Referencing other printed cards is a creative cop out. Don't even get me started on the PW &quot;named&quot; creatures and spells.</div><br /><br />A post from last week, but yes, this ++.

That's all. If you find running her works for you, great, have a blast. I would personally wait a few moneths if you can because I think the price will go down a fair biot post rotation. <br /><br />I tried running her, and honestly when I was playing, there was never a time I drew her and was happy about it. That's kinda my cut off point for running a card or not. If I wanted my opponent to sac a creature, I would rather draw Diabolic Edict, if I want to get a card out of an opponents hand, I'd rather draw a Thoughtseize, and if I want to discard a card from my hand I would rather draw a Mire's Toll or something. <br /><br />Although maybe you are talking about standard, which I am fairly ignorant on by choice. Although I thought standard these days was just Delver and then everything else? That's one of the reasons I stay away from the format, it hasn't been anything close to what I would consider a &quot;healthy&quot; format for ages. It's been Faeries and then everythign else, then Jund and everything else, then Caw Blade and everything else, then Wolf Run Ramp and everything else, now Delver and everything else. It's just the nature of standard that I've observed, the internet quickly figures out the most effective deck to play in tournamanets, and then the whole format quickly homogenizes around that.

              Wow, when did Akroma's Memorial get so high in value?  It was a trash rare around when I stopped playing.  Glad I still have a playset I kept just because I thought it was a fun card.

I'm not sure it's really good there, either.<br /><br />That's part of the reason I'm suspicious of reprints, especially when it comes to creatures that don't play well with powercreep.<br /><br />Once upon a time, I couldn't afford Nantuko Shade: I played B/R back in 1996, mostly because that's where the cheap cards were. Lightning Bolt, Hypnotic Specter, Hymn, those were cards I could afford. When I got back into Magic, Anwar Ahmed had a deck called Red Death. It played Nantuko Shade which was a $12+ card at the time. Of course, it (and all the other creatures in the deck) was completely outclassed by Goyf so the deck died. But then they go and reprint Nantuko Shade and now you can get them for $1 because it just can't compete with modern design (even though it's still better than Lili's Shade, etc.) Overall, even though I could buy a shitload of Nantukos now, I'd rather it have gone out on top, rather than like Tito Ortiz.<br /><br />I have to wonder if Serra Avenger will have the same fate. It fits into some delvers or geist decks, blowing open the mirror, I'd imagine, but back in the day I knew people who were so excited about it, they played it with aether vial to get it out a turn early like having a 3/3 was game. over. man. I'm having a hard time seeing it recapturing that kind of glory that it achieved the first time without ever being good (I think mike Flores was the only person to win with it...)<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/finance/24440-Forecasting-M13.html">http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/fina ... g-M13.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Of all the reprints, the only one who has seen actual play and has become a more attractive card has been sad robot.

              Yeah there are some not-too-old older cards that are priced kind of insanely; I'm in need of a new computer so I've been selling off a lot of my MtG stuff but yeah some prices are just bonkers, stuff like Grove of the Burnwillows and Iona; I only play EDH/Commander URB-Thraximundar and want to keep my Vintage/Legacy Enchantress deck, everything else is expendable, though.  I mean, yeah, Akroma's Memorial is fun in EDH but I never really considered it any more powerful than most of the other bombs in the format which is basically chock full of bombs to begin with <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Ah well, better sales for me I guess.<br /><br />Regarding your plight richleader, my gut is saying to hold off on buying Lili like Emkorial noted post rotation.  I'm not 100% sure they'd force some crazy-good integration with her in the new block to make her a powerhouse in any of the older formats, including Modern, so with her out of Standard I'd guess that the general demand for her would drop a bit.  And I want to believe that WotC is trying to scale back powercreep by reintroducing stuff like Serra Avenger and Searing Spear but yeah, unless they do it for almost everything across several blocks then folks will just pick out what <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> powerful and use that in their decks anyways.

              Vorthos moment: if you play MTG, it's weird to see how often US military propaganda uses the term &quot;warriors&quot; without giving it a second thought. It's like, dude, if you want to promote The Troops[tm] as a force for good, you put them on a white card (as soldiers), not a red one. Not ever. You're not just butching them up, you're making them look impulsive, out of control, savage! Think of the color pie! <br /><br />OTOH, maybe Magic gives you the tools to think critically and objectively about things...
