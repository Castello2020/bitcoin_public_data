Quote:You might think that if the National Security Agency were tapping the phones of dozens of world leaders, President Obama would be aware of this fact. Apparently not—according to a Wall Street Journal report last night, the NSA's spy operations are so extensive that not even the president of the United States knows about all of them. They've lied about everything else, why would they stop now?

Throwing out the very real possibility that they are lying about the whole thing, doesn't this seem extremely worrying that the NSA is spying on such high-level targets autonomously, with no external oversight?

maybe they spied on obama too, dug up some dirt to use as leverage, and allowed him to become president so he would make sure theyre always funded and given ever increasing power. maybe they do that with every president.

I don't buy that the President was unaware of phone taps used on world leaders. Nobody tells him about every low or mid level person being tapped, because the list is just too long. But Angela Merkel's phone gets tapped and nobody says anything to him? Bullshit.Even if he didn't know, this disclosure serves no real purpose and is just a naked play at damage control by the White House. The NSA should be up to their eyeballs in investigations (the real kind, no rubber stamp committees), and the President should be taking heat for letting this kind of thing happen. If he didn't directly know about a small number of high profile taps, he sure as hell knew that there was illegal mass surveillance going on. No excuses, no lessening of guilt. He is an overseer of these programs, and shares responsibility for their work output.

So once the NSA stops it's surveillance programs, what is to stop any other country's surveillance to step in? Who is to say that other countries aren't also running surveillance now? US only got caught because of a leak, who's to say everyone isn't monitoring everyone else???

Forgive me, but are people - and even Ars readers - really this naive? They thought the US intelligence agencies (and the agencies of every other country with enough money to conduct sophisticated intelligence) *didn't* spy on world leaders? That's the point. That's why they exist. There's no international right to privacy from spying enforced by God or the UN or whatever. Whether Obama knew about it is a separate question - I hope for his sake that he's being disingenuous and isn't actually a President who doesn't know what's being done in his own executive agencies.

He's the Commander in Chief and that means he's responsible for what happens under his watch whether he's ignorant of it or not. If he didn't know then he needs to start rolling the heads of the people responsible for keeping him informed out the door. That's the burden of being the leader.

This is a case where plausible deniability doesn't fit. It makes Obama look incredibly inept/weak, while also basically forcing some deeper cleaning. Regardless of where you stand on the ethics of Snowden, you cannot argue that he has failed to move the beast.

It seems that plenty of (american) folks seems that spying on allied leaders is perfectly OK and, in fact, a pretty good idea.Of course, I don't think the same folk would react too well if, for instance, their co-worker started poking in their personal email or spouse discreetly checked their SMS but, hey, it's OK if it happens to others.(not counting the fact that EU leaders seems much more ready to act when THEIR phone is being monitored than when it's "only" their compatriot's).

arsoofi wrote:Quote:German magazine Der Spiegel published an investigative report noting that US intelligence officials "used the American Embassy in Berlin as a listening station."I wonder how tid-bits like these are going to affect foreign relations.Probably not much. What's going on right now is public discussion of things that were already well known or assumed in private among diplomats. For instance, if there were evidence that appeared showing that the US Embassy in Beijing were spying on Chinese citizens, the Chinese government would have to get really angry and stamp its feet and so on like the Germans are doing now in order to make its citizens happy. But every single day, they already operate on the assumption that the US is spying on them from the Embassy. Or if they don't, they're idiots. Which they're not. I have an equally high opinion of German leaders. This is a show for the public, but the leaders are already well aware of what goes on.What's surprising to the public is apparently the fact that even most "allies" aren't exempt from spying on one another. But I'd encourage people to read a little diplomatic history and consider the nature of international relations before concluding that this is a major aberration.

If the CIA/NSA comes to the President and says "we have actionable intelligence that Osama is at X location" they probably won't preface it with "... we found this out by tapping the PM of Pakistan's phone." The NSA exists to gather intel from all and any sources to identify threats to the US. We've been tapping allies phones for decades, and if you think that this is some new revelation I've got a bridge to sell you enizer

For everyone supporting the NSA spying: Just the mere fact that this is such a huge controversy indicates that we as a society have struck the wrong balance on this topic. Stop spying at home before worrying about the Germans (although that bad too). My concern is the establishment of a framework that enables a police state 10-20 years from now...

But I really don't believe he didn't know. If for nothing else it'd mean he never asked where the information in his briefs was coming from. That being said, this is not a constutional issue. Congress and the courts have upheld the purpose of these agencies is to gather intel on foreigners. So it be silly to assume they wouldn't target the leaders of the countries as well. This story just makes the US look realy bad, but no U.S. law has been broken. The real issue is whether its constitutional or not to spy on Americans and how to get that question in front of a court. Because right now they are following the law and its not illegal till a court says that it is.

I think I am going to "go there" and point the finger at GWB. Kind of like the Iraq invasion or the derivatives crash, a quagmire of bad policy with a lot of inertia. Dick Cheney and crew again. Continued on unwisely under Obama, with slight attempts at amelioration. Many other examples could be given e.g. the DOJ. Now what?

I find failure to properly manage a federal agency as powerful as the NSA that he is ultimately in charge of is a much worse charge against President Obama than surveillance overreach ever could be. Imagine if this attitude were used to manage the units in charge of ICBMs.

But countries fundamentally can't trust each other at a very deep level. This isn't to say that all these revelations aren't going to do real damage to the US, or that the US surveillance apparatus isn't in some way out of control (especially if the President didn't know about this, and especially in terms of domestic surveillance). But if you expect countries not to spy on one another or think that this is somehow avoidable by just voting nicer people into office, you haven't thought very hard about the incentives facing leaders.

"Officials said the NSA has so many eavesdropping operations under way that it wouldn’t have been practical to brief him on all of them."Haha - well that is an ironic turn of events, now instead of the deny deny deny approach they are saying that they simply spy too much to let their superiors know about ALL of them. So unimportant people, like leaders of other countries, don't get reported, because if they started letting the people in charge know about ALL of the world leaders they spy on, then there would simply not be enough time to spy on them.
