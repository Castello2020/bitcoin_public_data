Also, how soon and how much can we expect the new consoles to drop in price?Read the whole story

Honestly, at $399, I can be an early adopter of the PS4. I've only ever scalped early systems in the past (save the wii).

So the gist I'm getting is, wait 2-3 years to let prices and games get all sorted out before buying my next console. Nothing new here, it was what I was planning to do anyway.

While the 360 was dropping its price and increasing HDD capacity (bringing the cost of the storage into the realm of pseudo-sanity) Sony was dropping the price and cutting features and ports. My phat bit the dust and the thing I miss the most is PS2 BC. So now I am thankful I have a PC good enough to run PCSX2. The 360 also added HDMI, but it's easily argued that it should have had that from day one.This new generation will certainly be interesting, if anything else.

Wow, the 3DO was $700 at launch, over $1100 in today's dollars....no wonder it did so poorly.

An amazing reminder of just how bad inflation was in the late 70's-early 80's. The 2600 and NES sold for almost the same dollar amount ($200 and $175 respectively) but in 2013 equivalent that's $768 for the 2600 and $432 for the NES just 8 years apart.

One slight problem with using real dollars in comparison is that it assumes that average purchasing power has stayed the same. So yes, the prices might be relatively similar over the long run, but the ability of people to buy them has been curtailed by the recession and rising inequality.

My 3DO and I still feel the pain of that price tag. On the other hand, bought more games for it / spent more time playing on it than any other console I've bought (regardless of perceived quality of the games), so perhaps money not so badly spent.

Inflation alone does not tell the whole tale as to why people are up in arms with pricing. More tech and gadgets demand our entertainment dollars these days ($600 phones, $80 plans, expensive broadband, rent/food prices rising faster than wages, stagnant wages, etc).Things like DLC, expensive peripherals, and uncertainty over imminent tech (like display technology) make pricey consoled a tough pill.Something else to consider is changing audience. Casual/mainstream is the norm today as opposed to enthusiasts/hobbyists.

Then i will replace it with the PS4, which i assumed it will be at least $100 dollars cheaper, putting the price around $299

Check the date at the bottom. I think it should be 1988 not 1998.

I think the question here is not whether the new consoles compare favorably to the cost of old consoles, but whether ANY console can succeed at the old price points in an age where we all carry game consoles loaded with 99 cent games in our pockets.

Remember the value back then too.You did not just get a system, you also got a game or games included with the system.My Atari 2600 Came with Combat and 2 controllers.When the 360 came out you did not get a full free game and you only got 1 controller.

Right now, the best cell phone games are still miles behind a below average console game.

Great article, thanks. I remember as a kid my parents bought me an Atari 2600. To a kid it was phenomenal piece of technology at the time. Man, you could play games in your house and everything (not to be confused with room, as most houses only had one TV)! My cousin later got the vastly superior Intellivision and to be honest I might have been a bit jealous at the time. I never could understand why my parents politely set aside or diverted my youthful requests to get one too. As an adult with a couple kids of my own now, a corresponding budget, and in reading about the price adjusted dollars these units cost at the time, I think I understand my parents a little bit better. Thanks!

Honestly, the issue isn't really that these two are overpriced, but the ps3 and 360. Those two at their current price level is ridiculous.

Another part about how 'expensive' a console is relies on the consumer’s budget. I'll throw in a fair warning here that the rest of this will be anecdotal. Most people I know don't have a gaming/console budget. Instead we tend to have an 'entertainment budget' which is a portion of our discretionary income. Our entertainment budget can include anything and everything from music purchases, trips to the theater/cinema/plays, cable/satellite packages, gaming, and outdoor activities. When thinking about where to spend my money, more investment in one area listed will take away from another...assuming I spend my money responsible and stick to my budget. If one area can serve the needs of multiple entertainment options, it’s less expensive to me even though the cost is more. The additional value makes up the rest. All that considered I think the current generation of consoles do represent pretty good value for what the offer but Sony is the clear winner here in terms of cost, value, and how 'expensive' it is.Edit: I forgot to mention that I really enjoyed the article. It was well done and looked at a side of gaming/technology that I expect from here.

There are games with million dollar budgets similar to Plants vs Zombies that are not as fun for a varity of reasons.You are indeed correct though that most o the games on Android and iOS are unable to go up against console games, but when you sell 5 million $0.99 units does it matter on the business side?

I would have liked to see the trends restricted to the top three consoles of any generation.

It's very interesting to read through this and consider these costs as they related to my parents, and not me who was too young to consider the realities of prices. Kinda puts it into perspective when I balk a bit at a $400 price tag to think, yeah that $200 NES system in 1985 pinched my parents a bit too.Also puts into perspective the reality that, being born in 1978, i've been coasting along with the entire console lifespan, so these diagrams hit home a bit.

I bought my 360 Premium in 2007 after the summer price drop, when it went down to $400 Canadian. The launch price was $500, and in the intervening two years the Canadian dollar had reached parity with the US dollar but prices hadn't adjusted to compensate. So, it took two years just for us to reach the point where those of us up in the Great White North could grab a 360 for the US launch price without heading down across the border! This was around the time that the Elite came out too, for a price of... $500. Hopefully this time around they keep the Canadian price the same as our neighbours to the South!

Here's the problem. Most people's income has not grown with inflation. You can argue about prices in 2013 dollars, but most of us aren't getting paid in 2013 dollars.

Right now, the best cell phone games are still miles behind a below average console game.This is an argument as old as computers. Simple graphics and low power generally make for a simpler game but also allow developers to concentrate on 'fun' rather than 'wow that looks amazing'. I can guarantee I have had more fun playing "Match Day 2" on the ZX Spectrum than all of the Fifa's for the last 20 years combined. That was a game written by two people - one of whom was the artist.

Wow, that timeline brings back memories.I didn't realize intellivision had that much of a lead on the collecovision. I'd be interested in the price of the intelivision 2 because that was the first console I had.My parents were not hip to the idea and I saved and saved and saved, originally I was saving for a 2600. By the time my 10 year old self had managed to hide the money away I found a deal on intellivision II and was amazed at what the tv could do. pitfall harry was graphically amazing.Then my cousin got a collecovision. donkey kong jr in your house and it was just like the arcade!console gaming has come a long way. I've always had a nintendo machine but never a hand held.I had a family friend with a four game pong unit and was hooked on video games ever since. At 40 it's still my go to hobby. Skiing was far more expensive, when I was in my prime I spent quite a few years as a skibum and I'll admit it took away console gaming for those years of my life but the computer was always there. the season pass for one year is like buying xbox1 and ps4 together. Skis last two seasons if your going 80+ days a year, boots tend to last if you get a pair that fits and you like them. Today's sports fans spend a pretty penny on seats to those games, I can't believe how things have gone up.Gaming is a relatively cheap hobby and one that work well with my aging heavily abused body. I already have a Wii U and haven't touched my 360 since, however Monster Hunter is the only reason I have it and the only system selling game for me personally. Because of that I'll not be buying a xbox1/ps4 right out of the game. There's rumors that monster hunter online is going to see some kind of international release and I can only hope capcom share's more of this brilliant game with the rest of the world. Japan has it good.

I haven't reviewed the data for accuracy, but it looks like adjusting for inflation we have the same purchasing power for anyone in the bottom 60%, with of course the difference being that game consoles are dramatically cheaper than any time except the late 90s, again inflation adjusted.

i dont' care what 'inflation' states. 399-499-599 to me is the same as it was in 1988 or 1998 or 2008.people don't think in terms like this. also technology is supposed to get cheaper. these consoles aren't bleeding edge from anything i've read (ok the ps4 ram is gfx card ram but whoopty doo). my sweet spot is 299 so when the ps4 hits that I may bite depending on games/how multiplats run on PC at that point. you can say inflation inflation inflation all you'd like but my eyes still see xbone at 499. i don't care if that's 10000000% cheaper than a 2600 back in the day.

I suppose that they are multi-use, and I may be too pragmatic or poor to understand it, but I find it difficult to see the value in some of these devices.

It's funny how depending on perspective what is "better" may be complete opposites.
