Wait wait wait.... 26 years!?!?What does a phone call from the 80's have anything to do with drugs being sold now?

At some point I've began to wonder how, with the ridiculously broad information being accessed that our agencies haven't been MORE successful in their various campaigns.

If the DEA was already collecting this information why did the NSA have to do it also?The executives that approved this level of access at AT&T can burn in hell. Why exactly did it take 26 years for this to be exposed?

I wonder how long until a divorce court orders AT&T's records - or until courts in other civil proceedings do so. Now that we know the database exists it's up to each court to determine if it's willing to provide access.As soon as AT&T is swamped with requests for such info they may choose not to save such information for 26 years so they don't have to "respond to valid subpoenas"

Why do AT&T even keep logs that long? (Yes I know - it's rhetorical)Or is there a law I'm unaware of that forces them to do this?

Mixed emotions... If it substantially helps manage the war on drugs then so be it, evidence however suggests that not to be the case... On the other hand the wholesale delivery of such large volumes of what should be private data on a whim show just how lax our privacy laws are. You can clearly see the whole data privacy is heavily weighted toward private companies having no rights to use any data for any reason while government has unrestricted authority and power to demand consume and use/misuse that data anytime anywhere and for any reason...

How many drugs have we killed since we started our war on drugs? More importantly, how many women and children drugs have been caught in the crossfire? Lastly, have we considered the nuclear option?

There seems to be a difference with this story vs the NSA stories in that AT&T is keeping the data and only sharing with is subpoenaed. This data is being used in public cases where auditing can keep a closer eye on its usage. That's a far cry from how our data is being collected and utilized by the NSA. This assuming someone can audit the program and show that it's being used properly.

We need an open source project.....A pan/tilt/zoom cam with wifi connectivity and audioA rechargeable batterySolar panelsShould be easy to put that together in a garage. The tricky part is making them cheap so millions can be made and sold. Set the wifi to open and leave the million of them outside city halls, government offices, military bases, cop shops, and anywhere else where they presume they have the right to snoop on citizens without a warrant.

So, presumably this can be done because of that whole "third party" nonsense? If you converse with a third party (like a cell phone company, or a lawyer, a doctor, a priest, etc.), you obviously no longer want that information private. Thus, the government has every right to be able to access that information—since you obviously don't want that information to be private.

It isn't warranted for any reason, otherwise our Constitution is a sham.Our privacy laws are not lax. The enforcement of our laws is lax. Nonexistent, really. Unless you're a corporation that has ties to the government, of course. Then the enforcement of your privacy is equivalent to national security.The problem is that people need to stop looking at "I'll give up some privacy to keep _______ off the streets" (insert drugs; child pornographers; terrorists; illegal immigrants; etc,) and start demanding that their government find ways to "declare war" on all these different ideas without touching, damaging, infringing, or breaking any of the Constitutional rights for the innocent masses.

While technically correct, the Ars article omits an extremely important point from the NYT source:Quote: It is queried for phone numbers of interest mainly using what are called “administrative subpoenas,” those issued not by a grand jury or a judge but by a federal agency, in this case the D.E.A. That's right, this data is received by the DEA with absolutely no court oversight.There is an aspect of this that is important and reasonable. In my opinion, the three problems are:1) No court oversight.2) 26 years is too much data to retain. Far, far beyond what is appropriate and necessary even for law enforcement purposes.3) No legal limitations on what else AT&T can do with this data, who they can share it with, who they can sell it to, etc.Resolve those three and it's fine with me. #1 is a pretty straightforward fix. #2 and #3 in my opinion require passing some real privacy laws, not just limitations on how the government works.

With all of those petabytes of personal communication information, how is there any crime at all if the intent is to stop & apprehend criminals? How is it any more than a 0.000000000000001% success rate with that level of information?

Drugs and terrorism ... Two problems that can simply be solved by spending more money on surveillance and enforcement. This can easily been seen the fact that we've spent billions on each since the eighties and both are nearly nonexistant today.

I'm not in the legal field, so I'd like someone with more knowledge of this to enlighten me on the differences in stringency/scope of subpoenaes vs. warrants. I'm also trying to get an idea of how this stacks up against the NSA's requirements which seem to be more of a speed-bump than anything protective. It seems this stringency is crucial.

Oh, an "administrative subpoena"?That's dramatically different than one authorized by a judge. It appears to mean that the only criteria is that someone filled out a form.

But that's not gonna happens since they're pretty much write their own laws. The future is bleak.

They previously were making similar amounts on the NSA data, it was an obvious profit center to open up.It also seems fairly obvious that the same data would be available to the NSA. If nothing else, the NSA and DEA have a data sharing agreement, we've already seen it documented that the NSA will provide data to the DEA, and it follows that the reverse would be true. But more likely the NSA can request the data directly from AT&T using their own administrative subpoenas or national security letters or whatever other non-judicial format they feel like. So even though the NSA only keeps data for 5 years (supposedly), they would have access to 21 more this way.

We have been told the NSA only keeps their data for 5. But with no privacy laws about the metadata, AT&T can legally retain as much as they feel like.And, any data retained by AT&T is by definition a business record which can then be obtained by the government under the Patriot Act.

Quote:By comparison, the NSA stores call data for five years.The problem is, I don't believe this. In fact I don't believe the NSA has ever destroyed any data. What is probably meant is more along the lines that the data has been archived in some fashion and is not immediately available for querying.AT&T says...Quote:AT&T declined to answer any specific questions but said, "We, like all other companies, must respond to valid subpoenas issued by law enforcement."But I think they have gone well beyond just answering subpoenas.Quote:Hemisphere has apparently grown more broad over time. For example, "Hemisphere began providing subscriber information in July 2012 for AT&T phones… started offering mapping through the GeoTime software in July 2012… [and] introduced limited pinging for some phones in May 2013," one slide says.

The government is using our money to mak ATT obscenely rich. If there was an argument for not paying federal income ripoff, this is it. We need to stop supporting these abuses with our money.
