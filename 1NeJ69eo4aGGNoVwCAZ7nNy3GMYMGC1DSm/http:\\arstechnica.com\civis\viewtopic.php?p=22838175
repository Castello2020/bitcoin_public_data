As we did recently we're shutting down site logins for a bit tonight to finish the upgrades we started last time. Should probably be offline for 1-2 hours. Should start around 2am EDT / 6am GMT if I'm not too tired to do the conversion correctly. Thanks for understanding, good things are coming!

I've always wondered where replies in these announcement threads go when the thread dies. Let's find out together.

So, since I see nothing in the feedback forum relating to this, I'll ask here. What all was updated? Any new cool features? I see the new titles/ranks for non-subscriptors, but I have no idea what they mean.

You guys brought back ranks? You know that this means we'll just have to smack down another WAAV* revolt, right?* - Or the equivalent, if WAAV isn't a rank anymore.

Isn't that a subscriber perk? To add whatever title you want I mean. Look under my nick. I could change that to my previously displayed rank. I don't think ranks will ever be back.

Quote:I think those users chose to have their rank as a special title.Those are enclosed in quotes.The ranks are legitimate. They've been talking about reintroducing them. Although my guess is that they're not supposed to be displaying just yet, but are because of something overlooked. Front page has been up and down and throwing errors. Several things appear to be in-progress...

I can't seem to log in on the front page, so it's still full of ads. Anyone else having that problem?

Apparently I TRANSCEND RANK.Ranks are back (yay!) and appear to have changed, and been added to. Time served now? Also, interestingly, my rank on forum posts does not match the rank on my user page.

I was getting constant database errors about 20 minutes ago, but everything seems sorted out now. The front page is loading quickly and correctly, and I quite like the new design. Congrats to everyone involved.Now where is my Star Trek category? Just put it under Opposable Thumbs or something. I'll write all the content myself Thoughtful

Can't login to main page. "Ego search" returns zero results. I'm sure it'll all be worked out soon.Also, next time, be sure to advise readers to follow their posts to the moon FROM A CLEAR SETTING AND OUTDOORS. You'll be hearing from my attorney regarding the large, egg-shaped contusion on my forehead.

Still having problems with the frontpage but it seems intermittent. Good luck fixing whatever is causing the hiccups.The redesign looks nice, except for the floating banner. It doesn't appear to be possible to make it auto-hide and when you scroll down, it covers a sentence or two of unread material. Possibly annoying only because of the wide tracts of unused space on the left and right side of the screen - fill it up or let the articles display wider.

I can partially view by checking cached site stored at Google and then clicking links to stories, I can get to the main site now Nevermind is intermittent, but can't log in at all. I also noticed that clicking "My Threads" in the forums now returns nothing.

I also noticed that clicking "My Threads" in the forums now returns nothing.This is 100% speculation on my part, but in his article about the redesign Ken talks about the new "My Stories" feature. I'm wondering if that's intended to have replaced (or to eventually replace) other features that previous tracked discussions in which a user was participating.Again, that's purely speculation.

Looks like some new titles from last time. Ars Legatus Legionis seems to be the new penultimate title. Ars Praefectus is also new, but I'm not sure where it fits in the scheme.

What's all this about ranks? I can't even figure out how to put a widdle picture under my name, and now I gotta worry about rank? If Private, Fail Class available? That seems an appropriate rank.
