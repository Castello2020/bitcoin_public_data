"...if they buy between now and the end of the promotion on September 6"When's the (rumoured) launch date of the iPad 5th Gen?(I actually would like an iPad 5, but I bet it misses this offer)

When I bought my iMac in 2010 I got a free iPod touch and a free wireless printer. Sold them both and knocked $300 off my Mac (and like another $150 off in education store). The deals nowadays suck.

Doesn't appear to apply to anything purchased through VPP either. Meh.

Does this mean no new Apple hardware until Sept 7?

just remember, with their 30% cut from all app store purchases, they are really only giving you $70...

Then again, the laptops are also cheaper than they were in 2010 and have higher build quality than they were back in 2010, so I don't mourn the loss of some additional discounts. Great build quality doesn't come cheap. Anyway, Apple isn't known for their discounts, so whatever we get is already better than nothing at all, which is typically the case. But just so you guys know, there are a lot better deals than what Apple gives at Apple resellers grahamwilliams

And what is going INTO your pocket is $100 worth of apps/books/movies/music. There's a thick black line between "true" and "relevant".

A mere $100 gift card is a joke when you consider that they used to give a free iPod instead.

There is no more need to give out iPod touches, they used them to create demand/user base for iOS/apps; i guess the students that used the iPod touch are now iPad buyers...And the $100 value to students of the gift card, is just $70 dent for Apple, but again the hardware has 40% margin...The deadline of Sep. 6th tells me on Sep. 7th the new iOS gen is launching... nice tease

They are giving their iOS and MAS developers $70, and "you" $100 of apps for free.This is a much better use of the money for Apple, helping their developers. It's called business strategy.Imagine if Google, Samsung, HTC, Moto, etc... Someone, anyone, in the Android ecosystem gave every student who bought a new Android phone this summer a $50 ($35 to developers) gift card to the Google Play store. That would help the Android developers and overall Android ecosystem. Developers love this type of promotion rather than discounts on iPods or iPod Touches. It's a great strategy.

This deal only negates sales tax for the most part. Not really a great discount.
