So I am pouring a bowl of cereal at the stove, and I hear chirping. After investigating, it turns out the vent cover for my stove exhaust is broken. I have birds nesting in the vent. What should I do.

Remove the nest, fix the vent. The birdies will build a new next someplace else.

Put a taco in a nearby tree, remove the nest, fix the vent. The birds will nest in the taco....probably not.

I'm not sure, but there may be babies already.

If there are eggs or chicks I'd leave them be and fix it after they move on (Won't someone think of the children!).If it is just a nest being build, I'd get rid of it and fix the point of entry.

i had a bird scrabbling around in my dryer vent a couple weeks back. no babies, just one grown up bird starting to make a nest. i took the vent apart and evicted him(her?). i don't think i would have been able to evict a family of tiny cheepy birds, though!

If I get home before sundown, I'll stick a camera up there.

Just turn on the vent fan. It'll take care of the rest.

It's a full on nest. Babies are quite noisy.

I have birds now too, but no eggs yet. The neighbors (we live in a two-family) have a harebrained scheme to use a shop-vac to vacuum out the nesting material. They have almost persuaded me.I'm not really willing to just let the nest be there until the eggs are laid and complete their transformation into birds; the nitrogen in the bird crap is apparently really bad for the ducting material. After we evict them we will install mesh "bird guards" over the vent outlets.

Just be glad they're content in there, and they're not exploring. My mom had this happen, except a baby bat got curious and managed to get into the kitchen. It was cute, but hoo boy did that freak us out.

One of the parents made it up to the fan bezel, but it flaps inward, so it was somewhat stuck. We extracted it and put it back outside. I've heard considerably less racket from the nest this week, so it looks like I'll be rigging some sort of device together to get it out this weekend. Some combination of broom handle or shop vac. New vent cover has been acquired.
