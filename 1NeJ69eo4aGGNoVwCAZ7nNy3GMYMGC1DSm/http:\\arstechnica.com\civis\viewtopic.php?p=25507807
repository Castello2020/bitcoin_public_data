The USS Zumwalt will be a floating data center—armed with missiles and robot guns.Read the whole story

Thats one awesome ship.I think its command and control center is the closest thing to a Star Trek style bridge thus far.The only scary part is it being hacked and those missiles being turned on our own. I am sure they have their best working to find every little flaw in the system, but we never had to worry about the guns on an Iowa class ship being remotely controlled.

Point of clarity - Do the 235 racks appear per each of the 16 units? That seems like it would be incredible overkill. Unless we are talking a different definition.

Well I think its great the Navy is upgrading and it is cool tech am I the only one that thinks maybe we shouldn't have an entire warship controllable from a computer that is networked (wirelessly at that). I'm all for robotics and AI but I don't think we are at the stage where we should be putting massive weapon systems under complete computer control. I'm sure the Navy has thought of this and has multiple safe guards in place to prevent it but what stops 1 person from taking over if all the control units are interchangeable? thekaj wrote:Quote:Perhaps it's appropriate that the first commanding officer of the Zumwalt will be Captain James Kirk (yes, that's actually his name).This can't be a coincidence.

The only issue with modern technology here is that it is susceptible to modern vulnerabilities. Even if we can prevent things like the weapon systems from being hacked and operated remotely, it is still vulnerable to other forms of electronic warfare. In the worst case scenario where all the advanced electronic systems go down, would the crew still be able to operate their vessel and perform their mission? Based on the heavy reliance on tech, I cannot see how they would.

Wow, CORBA is still around? That was all the rage in the late 90s - early 00s. It was a lot of fun to develop for, but man was it slow and bloated. CORBA was almost entirely replaced in pure java shops first with RMI, and then everybody and their mother jumped headfirst into SOAP and REST/JSON. None of the latter products had/have CORBA's scope and flexibility, but "good enough" is nearly always enough.BTW, a good book to learn about CORBA is "CORBA for Dummies" (1998). I always thought that putting "CORBA" and "Dummies" in one sentence was quite the oxymoron, but it really was excellent for learning the basics.

As a former Navy Electrician, my first though is redundancy. Is the Operations room duplicated somewhere else, in case this room is taken out by enemy fire? Seems like a lot to put in one place without any kind of backup system.

Somehow, this doesn't sound especially surprising to me. I always imagined military systems to run on some sort of fully-controlled only-what's-needed operating system, be it UNIX or OpenBSD, or whatever. They're not about to run Windows Server unless they could ask both Microsoft and the NSA for a version without backdoors......Wow, I had previously restrained myself from making unnecessary anti-NSA comments in other articles. I guess I thought that one was too good.

Seems to me that there's probably still single points of failure on the ship, it's just that it's now the server room AND the engine room AND the munitions room. If any of those are hit the ship is probably dead in the water. Roll on rail guns and lasers so that they're back to only having 2 single points of failure.

Besides, you want to give the guy some command experience before the a new, even cooler Enterprise, in a sane world. (yeah, yeah, I know, this Kirk probably already has plenty of experience, I mean, do you really just hand over the most advanced ship?)Anyway, did they install some gratuitous lens flare machines to periodically blind the crew? I mean, that's just sound military planning right there.

Seems like a lot to put in one place without any kind of backup system.The CDS consoles are also on the bridge. There's heavy redundancy of power and network to the ops center. But yes, if the Ops Center is taken out, the ship's weapons capability is offline. Of course, if the ops center is hit, the focus will be on getting the ship out of harms way anyway—and the ship's navigation and control systems can be operated from elsewhere.

Quote:Systems that weren't built to be wired into an IP network—other "programs of record" within the ship, which are installed across multiple classes of Navy ships—are wired in using adaptors based on single-board computers and the Lynx OS real-time Linux operating system. I'm getting tired of fixing your mistakes, people. Do your homework before writing your articles. LynxOS is closed source real-time OS that has some kind of compatibility with Linux. It is not Linux based. It can't be. What did you mean in that sentence?edit:Quote:Each CDS system runs multiple LynxOS-based Linux virtual machines, which can run on various networks partitioned by security level and purpose. So is it Linux virtual machines, or Lynx virtual machines? Sorry for being so inquisitive here, I have troubles understanding the sentence.

There were concerns about its handling characteristics, but the prototypes show it holds up. Also of note: the ship has a totally electric propulsion system, and has an integrated power system that will support future weapons like railguns and laser/RF systems.

In the worst case scenario where all the advanced electronic systems go down, would the crew still be able to operate their vessel and perform their mission? Based on the heavy reliance on tech, I cannot see how they would.It's tech heavy, but also built with a military mindset: those guns have to fire unless the guns have physically ceased to exist. If the network is down, there's a local control. If the control is down, there's some cranks that will let you aim the gun manually. If the radar isn't talking to fire control, fire the missile anyway and tell the radar to stay locked on the target. The missile is smart enough on its own to find the beam and ride it to the target.In another way, it's a lot easier to defend a ship against IT warfare than a website, because the ship can and will limit and compartmentalize outside communications during combat. So it's not going to be vulnerable to hacking at the one time you need it to be. That's not even getting into the logistics of first getting past the networks the ship uses to communicate (all secured and not publicly accessible) and then figuring out a way to compromise the ship itself.

It looks to me like the 4 environmental control units that hang on the outside might ship inside the container in the walkways and then be deployed to the end corners when they get on site. {Edit Urp! I am wrong, a little further down in the document it shows them being shipped with dummy blocks beneath each corner to make it into a single container shape. /Edit]

Minor nitpick: that's USS Excelsior, which in Trek lore is an experimental ship (notice the NX registry -- X denotes an experimental design just as in the modern Navy) and the first of her class. A ship of that design was later named Enterprise and appeared in a later movie (Generations) -- that shot is from Star Trek III. The Enterprise did not have the experimental propulsion system that Excelsior had -- it turned out to be impractical and the complexity wasn't worth the benefit.It's not unlike how a 1/4 scale model of the tumblehome design was built to ascertain whether it would be seaworthy.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_JetFrom a distance, these ships don't look like what we'd expect ships to look like, since the design's been out of use for so long. The Sea Jet actually showed up on a cryptid website:http://www.cryptomundo.com/cryptozoo-news/paddler-pic/ (lower right).
