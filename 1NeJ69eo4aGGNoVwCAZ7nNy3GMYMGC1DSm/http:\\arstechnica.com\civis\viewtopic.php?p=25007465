It gets annoying to read articles like this, comparing a brand new device with one that's almost a year old. I have a Nexus 7 and do not find it better than even my first gen iPad. Once you get past the specs, you actually have to use it. And honestly, I do not find Android better than iOS, so you can an 8 core CPU with 4 gigs of RAM, and all the tech specs you want, but that doesn't really mean anything more than bragging rights. You still have to actually use the tablet.

Yep, The Nexus 7 is the best Android tablet app on the market today, but the lack of tablet optimized apps is still a huge problem. It's even more of a problem on the Nexus 7 because even apps that are tablet-optimized feel cramped on the 7" screen (look at MLB at bat 2013, for example).

Memo pad has an Sd card slot which easily trumps the higher resolution of the new nexus pad. Oh, and look at that delicious price! Looks like the race to the bottom is on!

Nice hardware. It just needs a decent OS to run on it now I actually liked the textured back on my Nexus 7 and had generally very few complaints about it. If only the OS with all its useless background tasks and battery life didn't suck...

That new ASUS Memo Pad HD 7" tablet is actually very good for the price (I think it's around $150?), easily on par with the new Nexus 7. Though it has the stupid ASUS skin.

I want to buy one, but it's hard to justify buying another tablet.I like holding them with my fingers wrapped around both sides. I do the same with the iPad 2 (I have very large hands).

Another developer here prefers iOS, but had serious contemplations on using the Blackberry Z10 he got at the last conference. These aren't one size fits all propositions here, everyone has different tastes and expectations on what they want a device to do.

Except for the entertaining sight of people looking ridiculous while taking photos with tablets, what's the point of having a rear-facing camera in those devices, especially if it's "middling at best"?

My main gripe with this is the lack of pogo pins. I have an original N7, and the dock, and I love being able to use it as a digital picture frame when I'm not actively using it (and having it still be fully charged when I grab it). The lack of pogo pins/first-party docking solution is very disappointing to me. I might still get one just because of how slow the IO is on the original. (And the slowness of the IO on the original has a noticeable impact on user experience, not just 'oh, copying movies to it is slow'.)

Now Ars' review of Nexus 7 comes out. However, still nobody reviews the new Nexus 7's stand-by time. Can anybody test that? I don't imagine anybody using a tablet for 10 hours straight. The usage pattern is more like an hour today, then another hour tomorrow. The old N7's stand-by time is abysmal. What about the new one?

I will wait a few month to see what the new Ipad mini will be like. That, and my current Nexus 7 make me wary of Asus' build quality and QC.

So, to sum up the article, new Nexus 7 curbstomps the iPad mini and Apple really has their work cut out for them? (either by kicking up the power output on the reality distortion field or by actually giving their next mini better specs than matching its two generations prior full sized version)

If you're using an app with AR-like functions, then you want a rear-facing camera. Same with shopping apps that scan barcodes and the like. These applications don't need a good camera, just -some- camera.Me, I wouldn't mind it just to scan the occasional QR code-- mostly for connecting AirDroid or shuffling URL's around quickly.

A 1920x1200 vs 1024x768 is a 2.9 difference in pixel count, that's close to Retina's 4x difference in pixel. So I guess Retina is just a "greater-than-slightly higher resolution" compared to non-Retina.thegeneral wrote:Sure the Nexus has slightly higher resolution but just makes everything even smaller to read.No they won't. Android OS takes DPI into account when rendering so it will render texts to the same physical size. The same app on 2012 N7 will have the same physical size on 2013 N7.

To avoid looking ridiculous, one should try to stay in shape, and avoid dressing like a clown.

Can I "trust" this review?Remember last year how all reviewers praised the Nexus7. Today nobody uses it and reviewers calls the original Nexus7 junk. Will history repeat itself? BTW: Performance can't be measured by benchmarks when you compare a integrated eco system against a fragmented. The companies that control their OS and Hardware can optimise program. For example the A5: 30% of the die area is for Apple specific stuff like NOVA SIMD, sound DSPs for Siri and a fast memory controller. An optimised SIMD program will always be faster then a brute force "PC thinking" Android.Just look at game consoles. The platform exclusive titles are always better since they can be optimised. Supporting many platforms forces you to develop to the lowest common point. This is one of the main reasons why Apple EOL working macs/iOS devises to make the lowest entry point higher for developers. And I don't "hate Google". I will probably buy Nexus7 to get an Android device how Google invisions it.

The lack of an SD slot continues to be a deal killer for me; 32GB is not enough space for me unless I lived in a place with ubiquitous Wi-Fi, which I don't. (And wanted to stream everything from the cloud, which I also don't.)I'd really like to see some "Google Play" editions coming out on the tablet side, like we are on the smartphone side. In the meantime, I'll keep supporting my friendly CyanogenMod devs.EDIT: typo

I've had mine for 4 days now, and found it to be very nice. The only problem I have run in to has been reading comics in the Dark Horse app, but even that has not been a terribly bothersome experience.I have a couple caces to try on order, and plan to get a Qi charge this afternoon on the way home.araemo wrote:My main gripe with this is the lack of pogo pins.

(And the slowness of the IO on the original has a noticeable impact on user experience, not just 'oh, copying movies to it is slow'.)I will point out, regarding charging, that it does have wireless Qi. It's an additional cost if you already own a pogo dock, unfortunately, but Qi chargers are almost trivially cheap; you can walk in to a Verizon store and get one for $40. Amazon, etc, are $5 or so cheaper.I'm thinking about ripping out my touchstone mod on my Galaxy Nexus and replicating it with a Qi mod, if the voltages look right.

This is purely tangential, so a thousand apologies.The music you used in the preview has been resonating around my head for days now. I've been watching videos on YouTube (especially KSP videos - damn those docking manoeuvres) and it's on an awful lot of those. Can somebody please tell me what it is? If that's no trouble? It's been driving me bonkers.

Honestly my "old" N7 is still just fine. It does what I want it to and I don't personally have a need to update it yet. The new one looks nice, but without some sort of trade-in bargain I can't justify it.

I bought the original Nexus 7 very reluctantly because of its lack of expandable SD memory. I am almost ashamed to admit that I haven't really missed it. There are so many ways to get a data and media stored on LAN devices that I don't think I'll ever buy an SD card again.On the other hand, over the past year, the thing has slowed to a crawl... Also the display on the original is very desaturated. Overall, am not terribly pleased with it and not exactly excited to give them more money.

If you're a field agent, you use the camera at sights, having one less thing to bring with you when surveying. If you're a chef preparing a menu, you probably use the camera to take pics of the day's dishes. I can think of tons of examples.I can't imagine why a tablet wouldn't have a rear-facing camera on it and be anywhere as useful for many people.
