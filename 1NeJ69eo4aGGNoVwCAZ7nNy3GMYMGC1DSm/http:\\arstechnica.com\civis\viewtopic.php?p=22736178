Hope nobody was injured or killed. The Navy is going to have one hell of a lawsuit or settlement on its hands.

Looks like 3 8unit buildings were hit. If anyone was home, I can't imagine it was safe.

I'd be really worried about the fuel that no doubt spilled from the jet as well. That stuff is scary.

Are pilots supposed to stay with the plane rather than crash it into occupied areas? Or was that just a Blue Angels pilot who chose to do so? Just wondering.

Of course these are all just rumors and speculation at this point.

If you can't control the plane enough to save people, then you might as well exit.

The witness description (which is not necessarily the absolute truth...) is that the jet was nose up and dumping fuel as it came down.So it sounds more like an engine issue than an uncontrollable craft.

The local news witness described the jet going overhead silently, with loud clicking, as if trying to restore engines.

My understanding is that most fighter planes are actually not aerodynamically stable. That is, they must have significant forward movement in order to stay aloft. They do not glide like passenger planes do. So if the engines were having issues and they were dumping fuel in order to lower the gross weight sufficient enough for the engines to keep the aircraft aloft, they were doing what they were trained to do.

Yeah.... initial reports tend to make me think the crew (2 person crew on a F18) were doing all they could... dumping fuel, trying to get back over water, and sounds like they ejected at the last minute. Apparently the ejection seats came down less than 100 yards from the final crash site, which to me sounds like they probably hit hard... doubt the parachutes had a chance to deploy fully at that altitude.

I was thinking the same thing... modern jet fighters are practically uncontrollable without an engine (it is what produces the electric power for everything else, too). I've heard fighter pilots say "How in the heck do you crash a Cessna..." being that a Cessna 172 still has like a glide ratio of about 9:1 where a fighter is about 1/2 that (5:1) and... interestingly enough, commercial jets have a much higher glide ratio (near 20:1).

Not having been there I can only speculate, but I think they dump the fuel to lower the net amount of fiery-BOOM at the end of the ride. Although if somebody passed over me dumping jet fuel as they went I wouldn't consider it much of a favor.

The ejection seats were found not far from the crash meaning the pilots did what they could to get the plane out of the area.Looks like no one died and only a couple injured.

I watched the CNN piece, and the idiot on the phone was going off on how the jets seemed to be getting more and more reckless or some shit like that. 1) No. The Navy doesn't dick around over residential areas. 2) If you don't want to live under the flight path of a naval air station, DON'T MOVE UNDER THE FLIGHT PATH OF A NAVAL AIR STATION. Va Beach residents in that area have been bitching for years about jet noise and the inability to build high rise apartment buildings right in the flight line of a runway that's been there since 1943. Fucking idiots.That's not to say this isn't a tragedy. The pilots seemed to have been doing the best they could to minimize the damage as much as possible, and I applaud them for that. I also hope that no one was seriously injured or killed. But I also don't want the NIMBYs to get out of control, especially considering it was the Navy's back yard first.

The airport has been here in the same exact fucking location since 1928.But the fucking morons who built houses at the end of 16/34 bitch when a plane is "too noisy".Seriously WHAT THE FUCK RIGHT DO YOU HAVE TO BITCH IF YOU BUILD OR MOVE INTO A HOUSE AT THE END OF THE FUCKING RUNWAY OF AN AIRPORT THAT HAS BEEN THERE FOR LONGER THAN YOU OR YOUR FUCKING PARENTS HAVE BEEN ALIVE.It pisses me off. About four weeks ago we had a minor incident where a plane lost power and had to come in low and fast. The asshole the owns one of the houses complained and wants to SUE the airport because he was woken up in the afternoon by this aircraft...

Still no casualties reported. As to the contradictory opinions of VBers, what do you expect. It's not like everyone has to agree. And the people complaining about jet noise are a vocal few. There's a fairly popular bumper sticker/t-shirt around here proclaiming love of jet noise.

They still let McCain fly?---Agree on the noise thing, AFAIK it was bitchy Americans that kept the Concorde from opening more routes and flying at the correct speed over USA, because the sonic boom would be loud.

My Dad has a cottage in the SW of Cornwall, and it was close to the flightpath of the Air France Concorde. You would hear the boom at 11am. Usually not too bad, but if it went supersonic closer to land than normal it would shake the windows. Concorde really didn't belong over populated areas.
