Fighting for Vivian's Medicine Submitted by MMJ Ministry on Sat, 12/21/2013 - 20:03. Permalink
Garyn and Joey from Magical Butter visit the Wilson family in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. Two-and-a-half-year-old Vivian Wilson suffers from a rare and severe form of epilepsy that she will have for the rest of her life. Her parents have struggled to find a medicine that could bring her relief. Frustrated with pharmaceuticals, the Wilsons turned to medical marijuana -- particularly strains featuring the non-psychoactive cannabinoid CBD. However, they have faced many roadblocks along the way, including New Jersey's medical cannabis program and Governor Chris Christie.
