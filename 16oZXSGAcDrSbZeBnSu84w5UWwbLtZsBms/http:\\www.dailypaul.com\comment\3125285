natural viability
Submitted by MMJ Ministry on Wed, 07/03/2013 - 21:38. Permalink
for me i draw the line at natural viability which i would consider late term abortion.
in the future they will be able to extract the fetus and grow it in a lab so natural viability is the more consistent position over medical intervention.
there is no perfect answer on this issue. i'm pro life for myself but pro choice for others until natural viability with a few rare exceptions.
