Submitted by MMJ Ministry on Tue, 03/19/2013 - 20:00. Permalink
however those bitcoins i bought a few weeks ago for around $29 have gone up to $59 today. i went ahead and cashed out a few $1000. thank god i sold some of my silver to buy bitcoins. my silver investments have not done anything in years. if silver goes under $27 i may get some more though.
