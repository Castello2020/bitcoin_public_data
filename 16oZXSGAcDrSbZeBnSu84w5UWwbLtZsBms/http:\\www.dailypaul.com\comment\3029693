the most relieving thing about bitcoin haters is
Submitted by MMJ Ministry on Mon, 04/08/2013 - 02:21. Permalink
95% of them have no idea of what they are talking about.
bitcoin is not at all affected by skype malware so the title is misleading. somebody just figured out how to take over peoples computers that run skype and instead of using the bandwidth to do ad clicks etc (been happening on skype for 10 years)they have figured out how to instead use the bandwidth to mine bitcoins. it does not affect my bitcoins or even the person who is infected. skype malware is old news.
if you can hold it, the government can take it.
btc $174+
keep stacking bitcoins and silver.
