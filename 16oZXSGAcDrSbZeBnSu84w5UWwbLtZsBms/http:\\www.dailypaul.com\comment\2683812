slavery is not something moral people condone.
Submitted by MMJ Ministry on Thu, 08/23/2012 - 17:15. Permalink
“That many civilized, nay, Christianized people should approve, and be concerned in the savage practice, is surprising.” Thomas Paine
"The declaration which says that God visits the sins of the fathers upon the children is contrary to every principle of moral justice." [Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason]
Paine Published African Slavery in America in 1775 criticizing slavery as unjust and inhumane. Paine was a strong abolitionist almost 100 years before the end of slavery and was one of only two founding fathers to have never owned slaves - the other being John Adams.
