"Hemp is of the first necessity to the wealth and protection of the country." - Thomas Jefferson
“Speaking generally, the Commission are of the opinion that the moderate use of hemp drugs appears to cause no appreciable physical injury of any kind.” - Indian Hemp Drugs Commission 1893-1894
"Make the most of the Indian Hemp Seed and sow it everywhere." George Washington
"Sowed Hemp at Muddy hole by Swamp."
May 12 George Washington
Diary Entry, May 12 , 1765
"began to separate the male from the female plants" - George Washington
Diary Entry, August 7, 1765
“Certainly no good reason can be assigned why the
Hemp of New Zealand should not thrive with us, as
that country lyes [sic] in about the same Southern latitude
that our middle States do in the Northern. The
Hemp of the East Indies grows well here and I have no doubt of the Tea plant suc-ceeding in So. Carolina and Georgia.”
LETTER FROM PRESIDENT WASHINGTON
TO JOHN SINCLAIR
December 10, 1796
-----------------------------------------------------------------
"Some of my finest hours have been spent on my back veranda,
smoking hemp and observing as far as my eye can see."
- Thomas Jefferson - Disputed Quote
