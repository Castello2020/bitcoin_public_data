DP Original
The Daily Paul turns six years old on January 19th. I registered the domain on on that date, 2007, and the first post went up two days later. After two presidential elections, the DP remains an important online center of the Liberty movement. I loathe asking for money, but it has become critical. Only shortly after the site became fun again (it wasn't much fun for me during the election season), things have started to break down. Ghosts are haunting the machine. People are having problems voting on posts and comments, and returning comments to certain users. The errors are random and hard to reproduce. Yesterday we were hit again with an erroneous malware alert from Google that suspended traffic and caused ad revenue to plummet. Big Mike said it's like the site has leprosy - everything is falling apart!
Like a car or a house, the website needs maintenance and repair, and I'm asking for your help to do that. How you can help:

I'd appreicate it if you'd include your username, but that is up to you.
Bitcoin:
Frankly, I don't know how to use Bitcoin very well, but thanks to haze and rpcongress, I'm learning a lot fast. Here is an address you can use to send some bits:

If anything shows up in that wallet, It'll help me in my education. If someone can educate me on how better to receive bits, please post it in the comments below, or use the contact form.
It is impossible to know what the future holds, but I have a feeling that 2013 is going to be a big year for us, and the 2014 elections are just around the corner.
Thank you all for your love support of this community. Here is to another 6 years going forward.
In deepest gratitude and love,
Michael
