When the masses wake up Submitted by MMJ Ministry on Thu, 03/14/2013 - 19:19. Permalink
hmmm, if only there was a way to accelerate the wake-up of the masses. maybe if we had a libertarian type president i think that would help. what say you?
or we could crawl into the spider hole bunker and not do anything and give up. don't let them pass more laws and arrest more people. we should vote to repeal bad laws like we did here in Colorado and like they did in Washington.
no, giving up and thinking we can ignore them will only end in a bloody battle. the most peaceful transition to a voluntary society is through rand. like i said before, sure work outside of the system as much as possible. be agorist, grow your own food, store food, raise chickens, get silver and bitcoins, have guns and plenty of ammo to protect your family but vote and don't give up. if you give up you will for sure get a long bloody transition to a voluntary society. both ideas will work i just prefer the most peaceful one.
