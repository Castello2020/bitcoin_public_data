bitcoin ip logging
Submitted by MMJ Ministry on Fri, 12/13/2013 - 05:43. Permalink
bit of a technical question but one that should be explored more and explained.
Bitcoin: Protect your privacy from the New World Order Panopticon
Bitcoin is often perceived as an anonymous payment network. But in reality, Bitcoin is probably the most transparent payment network in the world. At the same time, Bitcoin can provide acceptable levels of privacy when used correctly. Always remember that it is your responsibility to adopt good practices in order to protect your privacy.
Your IP address can be logged:
Because the Bitcoin network is a peer-to-peer network, it is possible to listen for transactions' relays and log their IP addresses. Full node clients relay all users' transactions just like their own. This means that finding the source of any particular transaction can be difficult and any Bitcoin node can be mistaken as the source of a transaction when they are not. You might want to consider hiding your computer's IP address with a tool like Tor so that it cannot be logged.
