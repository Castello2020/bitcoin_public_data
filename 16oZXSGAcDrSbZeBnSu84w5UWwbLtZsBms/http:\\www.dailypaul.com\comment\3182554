"as a Christian, I can't
Submitted by MMJ Ministry on Wed, 08/28/2013 - 17:10. Permalink
"as a Christian, I can't support abortion, gay marriage, drug use, etc"
what does being christian have to do with drug use? is drug use forbidden in the bible by a talking snake like the forbidden fruit?
also, do you support the government being involved in abortion? what should their role be?
