<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img class="alignleft" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v474/autorank/Articles/salah1.jpg" border="0" width="264" height="291" /><br /> <em>The  UN said in its resolution said that they wanted to protect civilians. I  am a civilian. I&#8217;m asking the United Nations and the National  Transition Council for help for the citizens of Sirte.</em> Ali Salah Arzaga, Sirte, Libya. (His home and business were destroyed in the final assault on his city.)</p>
<p>There  are very public smoking guns that inculpate the rulers of the United  States, the United Kingdom, France and others in war crimes in Libya.</p>
<p>The  rationale for NATO&#8217;s entry into the Libyan conflict was based on  humanitarian principles, correctly noted by Mr. Arzaga. (left, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/VOAvideo#p/u/3/XGHfP3_hJ1s">text and image: VOA video</a>). The United Nations Security Council passed <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10200.doc.htm">resolution 1973 on March 17</a> and NATO followed up with actions that the alliance and its partner  Qatar claimed conformed to the resolution. The sole purpose of NATO&rsquo;s  involvement was to &#8220;protect the Libyan population,&#8221; we were told.</p>
<p>The  outcome has been anything but humanitarian. Tens of thousands of  Libyans are injured or dead. The nation&#8217;s infrastructure is in tatters.  One city, Sirte, was destroyed during the final push while another city,  the non-Arab Black Libyan town of <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/09/13/123999/empty-village-raises-concerns.html">Tawergha</a>, is absent its entire population, 25,000 residents. They were there just a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>To  understand what was done by participating NATO nations and Qatar, which  joined the effort, and answer questions about war crimes, consider the  following: the United Nations authorization for NATO assistance, the  NATO declarations of intent and actions, plus reports of behavior, and  the Protocol 1 of the Geneva Convention, 1977. With this foundation, it  will be possible to evaluate the behavior of NATO and Qatar.</p>
<p>The  following evidence will demonstrate that the UN, NATO, and Qatar donned  the mask of humanitarian aid while engaging in a systematic act of war  against Libya to achieve regime change. Furthermore, it will be  abundantly clear that the participants by their own admission actively  collaborated in acts of war that were not authorized by the UN and that  resulted in violence against civilians and the infrastructure of the  nation.</p>
<p>Please note that criticisms and negative judgment  concerning the behavior of the NATO do not imply support for the actions  over time or for the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/01/24/libya-words-deeds">human rights</a> record of the late Muammar Gaddafi and his government. Regardless of  Gaddafi&rsquo;s record, clear analysis is required when the leaders of the  United States, the United Kingdom, and France make war the way they did  in Libya. This was done in the name of the citizens of those nations,  without consultation or formal consent.</p>
<p><strong>UN Security Council Resolution 1973 (2011) on Libya </strong></p>
<p>The overriding purpose of the Security Council resolution was to <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10200.doc.htm">protect civilians</a>.  The resolution affirmed that member states of the UN will, &#8220;take all  necessary measures &hellip; to protect civilians and civilian populated areas  under threat of attack in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, including  Benghazi, while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any  part of Libyan territory&hellip;&#8221; <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10200.doc.htm">UN, March 17</a></p>
<p>The first military action authorized by the mandate was a <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10200.doc.htm">no-fly zone</a>.  Participating nations were mandated to &#8220;establish a ban on all flights  in the airspace of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in order to help protect  civilians&#8221; and &#8220;to take all necessary measures to enforce compliance  with the ban on flights.&#8221; <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10200.doc.htm">UN, March 17</a></p>
<p>The  second military action was an arms embargo: &#8220;ensure strict  implementation of the arms embargo&#8221; outlined in UN Security Council  resolution 1970 (2011). That resolution is clear: &#8220;all Member States  shall immediately take the necessary measures to prevent the direct or  indirect supply, sale or transfer to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, from or  through their territories or by their nationals, or using their flag  vessels or aircraft, of arms and related materiel of all types.&#8221; <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10187.doc.htm">UN, February 25, 2011</a></p>
<p>Additionally  resolution 1973 required that any flights originating in Libya be  cleared by NATO, froze all Libyan government funds overseas, and  authorized the creation of a <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10200.doc.htm">panel of experts</a> to inform the UN of any deviation from the NATO action&rsquo;s main mission of protecting the people of Libya.</p>
<p>At  no point did any UN Security Council resolution authorize NATO and  Qatar to take sides in the conflict, to commit acts of war that  benefitted one side, or to assure that one side or the other emerged  victorious.</p>
<p><strong>NATO Declarations</strong></p>
<p>NATO&#8217;s main web page on its Libyan effort states that its mission conforms precisely to the authorizing resolutions from the UN:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Since  March 24, an unprecedented coalition of NATO Allies and non-NATO  contributors have been protecting civilians under threat of attack in  Libya, enforcing an arms embargo and maintaining a no-fly zone. As NATO  Secretary General Rasmussen explained, under <em>Operation Unified Protector</em>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NATO is doing &#8216;nothing more, nothing less&#8217; than meeting its mandates under United Nations Security Council resolutions</span>.&#8221; <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_71652.htm?">NATO, October 2011</a></p>
<p>A NATO fact sheet describes the use of military assets and personnel employed in the Libyan effort:</p>
<p>&#8220;NATO  conducts reconnaissance, surveillance and information-gathering  operations to identify those forces which present a threat to civilians.  NATO air assets can then engage targets on the ground, at sea or in the  air. Ships and submarines policing the arms embargo contribute to the  mission on a case-by-case basis.&#8221; <a href="http://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/pdf_2011_10/20111005_111005-factsheet_protection_civilians.pdf">NATO, October 2011</a> (author&#8217;s emphasis)</p>
<p>NATO&#8217;s  task was to bring to life the UN resolution designed to &#8220;protect  civilians.&#8221; There was no mention of assisting the military operations of  the Libyan rebels fighting the Gaddafi regime. There was no  authorization to attack and destroy civilian targets. Most importantly,  there was no authorization whatsoever, no matter how tortured the logic,  that enabled the coordination of land and air forces to win a military  victory. The stated purpose of the UN resolution was to protect  civilians.</p>
<p><strong>What Really Happened in Libya &#8211; the Smoking Guns</strong></p>
<p>Three  smoking guns destroy the claim that the UN and NATO intervened in Libya  to protect civilians. They are the brutal bombardment and sacking of  Sirte, the recently revealed supply of arms to the rebels by coalition  partner Qatar, and the coordination and link between Libyan rebel land  forces and NATO air efforts. These events took place. They are  acknowledged by the parties in public media. The actions represent  violations of Protocol 1 of the 1977 Geneva accord on protecting  civilians and violations of the UN mandate and stated principles of  NATO. Taking sides with the <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/Default.aspx?SID=1&amp;ParentID=0&amp;LangID=1">National Transition Council (NTC)</a>,  the umbrella group for the Libyan rebels, is clearly outside the bounds  of preemptive wars, even as allowed in very narrow cases in the UN  Charter.</p>
<p><strong>Destroying the City of Sirte</strong></p>
<p>In  early September, the commander of the NTC demanded that the town of  Sirte surrender. While town leaders tried to negotiate a peaceful  resolution, the presence of Gaddafi loyalists prevented this from  happening. The population of Sirte was 80,000, the vast majority of them  civilians. On October 8, NATO began a furious aerial bombing of Sirte.  The entire city was affected.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/gadhafi-hometown-pays-heavy-1211594.html">Associated Press</a> reported on October 27 that, &#8220;Resistance in Sirte was fierce, and three  weeks into the battle, anti-Gadhafi forces had advanced only a few  hundred yards (meters) into the city.&#8221; NATO&#8217;s air bombardment broke the  stalemate on the ground:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;It  all changed after a NATO bombing assault on October 8, when the ground  did not stop shaking all night. Next morning the rebels pushed forwards,  expecting the usual fierce resistance. There was none.&#8221; <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/details-of-gaddafis-ignominious-end-shrouded-in-confusion-and-shame/story-e6frg6so-1226174479193">The Australian, October 24</a></p>
<p>Even  without resistance, upon entering Sirte, &#8220;the rebels flattened the area  with everything they had, bringing their tanks and heavy guns into the  city and blazing away at every building standing between their own  positions and the sea.&#8221; <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/details-of-gaddafis-ignominious-end-shrouded-in-confusion-and-shame/story-e6frg6so-1226174479193">The Australian, October 24</a></p>
<p>The  city of Sirte was not an aggressor in the civil war in Libya. The city  did not organize attacks or officially endorse attacks. It was filled  with civilians. There were also remnants of Gaddafi forces that resisted  the NTC rebels&rsquo; entrance into the city. These were defensive actions,  at this point in the conflict. No aggressive campaign by these forces  could have been envisioned. The city just happened to be Gaddafi&#8217;s  hometown and unable to join the new government. This was understandable  since it had been bombed by the NATO-NTC alliance.</p>
<p><strong>Indiscriminate Attacks on Civilians by NATO</strong></p>
<p>Protocol 1 <a href="http://deoxy.org/wc/wc-proto.htm">Additional to the Geneva Conventions, 1977</a>,  outlines the protections for civilians in war zones agreed to by the  signatories. All of the NATO participants as well as Qatar had signed  Protocol 1 concerning &#8220;any land, air or sea warfare which may affect the  civilian population, individual civilians or civilian objects on land&#8221; (<a href="http://deoxy.org/wc/wc-proto.htm#a49">Article 49</a>).</p>
<p>The  fact that there were Gaddafi loyalists among the 80,000 civilians in  Sirte did not provide NATO and the Libyan National Transitional Council  (NTC) fighters with an excuse to attack the city indiscriminately.  Article 50 states that &#8220;The presence within the civilian population of  individuals who do not come within the definition of civilians does not  deprive the population of its civilian character.&#8221;</p>
<p>The attacks by NATO and the NTC were indiscriminate according to <a href="http://deoxy.org/wc/wc-proto.htm#a51">Article 51</a>:  &#8220;Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Indiscriminate attacks are: a)  those which are not directed at a specific military objective; [or] b)  those which employ a method or means of combat which cannot be directed  at a specific military objective.&#8221; When an entire city is devastated and  systematically demolished by military forces, as reported, the attack  is on the entire city, not just a specific military target.</p>
<p>The  bombing was so comprehensive that it eliminated both resistance and most  of the people of the city, who either fled or were killed or injured.  It was indiscriminate. In Sirte, &#8220;the ground did not stop shaking all  night&#8221; before the NTC troops entered and began their destruction.</p>
<p>NATO  knew or should have known that fierce bombing would impact civilians.  The fact that many were killed and many more fled is further evidence of  the indiscriminate nature of the attacks. NATO acted in coordination  with the NTC rebels and those rebels likely used Qatar-supplied arms, as  admitted by the commander of Qatar&#8217;s forces (see below).</p>
<p><strong>NATO  alliance partner Qatar provided arms to the NTC rebels and put troops  on the ground to train the NTC. Those troops coordinated between NTC  rebel and NATO military forces. This violates the UN mandates for NATO  and contradicts NATO&#8217;s own claims about its behavior in Libya. </strong></p>
<p>UN Security Council <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/17/un-security-council-resolution">Resolution 1973 (2011)</a> stated that the goal of the Libyan intervention was to protect  civilians. It authorized the creation of a no-fly zone, an arms embargo,  a freezing of Libyan assets, a ban on all flights from Libya of any  type without NATO permission, and a panel of experts to assure that the  resolution was followed by NATO.</p>
<p>NATO claimed to follow the UN  resolution to the letter. On its web page, NATO asserted: &#8220;No NATO  ground troops have participated in the operation &ndash; NATO&rsquo;s success to  date has been achieved solely with air and sea assets.&#8221; <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_71652.htm">NATO, October 2011</a></p>
<p>But  Qatari ground troops were on the ground training and coordinating NTC  ground efforts with NATO air power. &#8220;NATO&#8217;s success to date&#8221; had an  additional essential and highly relevant component &#8212; the coordination  of its air efforts with ground strategies, tactics, and information that  that was offered by Qatar as described by Qatar&#8217;s Major General Hamad  bin Ali al-Atiya on October 26 (see below).</p>
<p>The resolution did not  authorize NATO to take sides in the conflict since that would have been  an act of war, a preemptive war to be specific.</p>
<p>But isn&#8217;t aligning with the NTC rebels taking sides? Qatar was part of the NATO effort in Libya.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;We were among them and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the numbers of Qataris on ground were hundreds in every region</span>,&#8221; said Qatari chief of staff Major General Hamad bin Ali al-Atiya.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Speaking  on the sidelines of a meeting in Doha of military allies of Libya&rsquo;s  National Transitional Council (NTC), Atiya said the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Qataris had been &#8216;running the training and communication operations.&#8217;<br /> </span><br /> &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Qatar had supervised the rebels</span>&#8216; plans because they are civilians and did not have enough military experience. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We acted as the link between the rebels and NATO forces</span>,&#8217; he said.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Libya&rsquo;s interim leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil told the meeting that Qatar had been &#8220;a major partner in all the battles we fought.&#8221; <a href="http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/10/26/173833.html">Al Arabiya News, October 26</a> (author&#8217;s emphasis)</p>
<p>The  scenario outlined by General Hamad was confirmed by an extensive report  in the Wall Street Journal by Sam Dagher and Charles Levinson in  Tripoli and Margaret Coker in Doha, Qatar.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Qatar  provided anti-Gadhafi rebels with what Libyan officials now estimate  are tens of millions of dollars in aid, military training and more than  20,000 tons of weapons. Qatar&#8217;s involvement in the battle to oust Col.  Gadhafi was supported by US and Western allies, as well as many Libyans  themselves.&#8221; <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204002304576627000922764650.html">Wall Street Journal, October 17</a></p>
<p>The article goes on to explain why Qatar was chosen as the agent for the war effort masquerading as a humanitarian mission.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;As  violence escalated in Libya, Western diplomats said it soon became  clear that without an armed ground effort by the rebels, the NATO  strikes would only enforce a stalemate. But U.S. and European  governments thought it too risky to directly arm a rebellion against a  sitting leader.&#8221; <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204002304576627000922764650.html">Wall Street Journal, October 17</a></p>

<p><strong>NATO  knew of and supported the actions of its alliance partners, the  Qataris. The UN knew or should have known that NATO was supporting  actions that violated the arms embargo and that provided ground troops  and coordination between air and ground military efforts. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The  acts of the UN and NATO show that the UN Security Council resolution  and NATO claims of honoring that resolution were fraudulent.</strong></p>
<p>U.S.  Ambassador to Libya Cretz provides the proof of NATO knowledge of the  major violations of the UN resolution. From the article:</p>
<p>Qatar has  played &#8216;a very influential role in helping this [Libyan] rebellion  succeed,&#8217; U.S Ambassador to Libya Gene A. Cretz said in an interview. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204002304576627000922764650.html">Wall Street Journal, October 17</a></p>
<p>The  NATO alliance was obliged to keep foreign weapons, troops, and  assistance out of Libya as required by the UN resolution. The ambassador  makes it clear that the actions of the Qataris were helpful and clearly  implied that regime change was the goal, not the protection of  civilians.</p>
<p>The UN knew or should have known that its resolution  was being violated. Section 24 of Security Council resolution 1973 calls  for the creation of a &#8220;panel of experts&#8221; to monitor the Libyan  conflict, assure compliance with the UN mandate, and &#8220;Make  recommendations on actions the Council, or the Committee or State, may  consider to improve implementation of the relevant measures.&#8221; <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10187.doc.htm">UN, February 26, 2011</a></p>
<p>If  the panel of experts spoke to Ambassador Cretz or one of his peers, for  example, they would have known that the actions in the name of the UN  were diametrically opposed to the stated goals of the UN. If the &#8220;panel  of experts&#8221; didn&#8217;t know that the mission was a fraud on the UN and the  people of the world, they should have. In either case, the UN is  responsible for the acts of NATO done in the name of the UN.</p>
<p><strong>The  NATO mission was an attack on the Libyan government at that time  without an imminent threat to any of the nations involved. It was a  violation of international law.</strong></p>
<p>International law places very strict limits on preemptive wars. This is the general outline for &#8220;anticipatory self-defense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The  right of anticipatory self-defense assumes that an aggressor is poised  to strike, and that one acts defensively in anticipation of the attack  rather than waiting for the attack to occur. Traditionally, it was  deemed theoretically possible that even a first-strike could be deemed  defensive in nature, and lawful, if it was to forestall an attack that  was imminent.&#8221; <a href="http://www.cdi.org/news/law/preemptive-war.cfm">Center for Defense Information, 2003</a><strong></strong></p>
<p>The  UN has some provisions in its charter for anticipatory self-defense  arising out of Security Council actions. However, there was no  self-defense asserted, no imminent danger, no war outlined. The mission  was mandated solely to protect Libyan civilians through the no-fly zone,  arms embargo, asset freeze, etc.</p>
<p>NATO misrepresented its role as  &#8220;nothing more, nothing less&#8221; than those actions mandated by the Security  Council resolution, 1973. By allowing in ground troops as well as  thousands of tons of weapons, and coordinating air strikes for the  benefit of opponents of the Libyan government, NATO engaged in war that  meets even the narrowest definitions of preemptive war. That is a  violation of international law.</p>
<p><strong>Justice Will Not Be Forthcoming</strong></p>
<p>NATO  went well beyond the bounds of the UN mandate. It allowed the mission&rsquo;s  one nation that was not a part of NATO, Qatar, to violate the arms  embargo, to provide troops, and to use those troops to coordinate NATO  air strikes with NTC rebels on the ground. As a result, NATO and the NTC  rebels were acting as one, fighting an aggressive war against the  Libyan government. It was a series of lies that provided the foundation  for the Libyan effort, lies that repeated principals that those directly  involved were never expected to follow.</p>
<p>By waging war instead of  protecting civilians, all parties to the effort engaged in an elaborate  ongoing war crime against the very civilians that they were supposed to  protect.</p>
