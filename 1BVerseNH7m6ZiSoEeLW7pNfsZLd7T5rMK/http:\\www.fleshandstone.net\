			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;">The<strong> </strong>impact factor (IF) of an <span>academic journal is a measure reflecting the average number of citations to recent articles published in the journal.

<p>It  appears that someone in Washington called several government officials  in Europe to force the landing of a jet carrying the President of  Bolivia.&nbsp; If that proves to be the case, the actions by all involved  violate of the 2010 international protocol to help <a href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ddcaa774.html">stop skyjacking</a>.&nbsp; The protocol, signed by all but a few nations, says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Any  person commits an offence if that person unlawfully and intentionally  seizes or exercises control of an aircraft in service by force or threat  thereof, or by coercion, or by any other form of intimidation, or by  any technological means.&#8221;&nbsp; <a href="http://legacy.icao.int/DCAS2010/restr/docs/beijing_protocol_multi.pdf">2010 Protocol Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Un-Lawful Seizure of Aircraft</a></p>
<p><strong>Paranoia on Steroids</strong></p>
<p>The  president of Bolivia, Eva Morales, flew to Russia for an international  energy conference.&nbsp; His plane landed and stayed at Vnukovo International  Airport while he was at the conference. &nbsp;&nbsp;During the conference,  Morales indicated that he would consider providing asylum for NSA  whistleblower Edward Snowden.&nbsp; However, he didn&#8217;t offer asylum or  grandstand when he responded to a reporter&#8217;s inquiry.</p>
<p><img class="mceWPmore" src="http://agonist.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" border="0" title="More..." /></p>
<p>Based  on the forced landing of the Morales plane and the new&nbsp; &#8220;Insider  Threat&#8221; program to squash whistleblowers, the Obama administration  obviously wants Snowden in the worst way.&nbsp; The diplomatic requests mask a  deeper sense of entitlement that turned into recklessness in this  situation.</p>
<p>When the Morales plane left Russia, there was a refueling stop planned in Spain&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/07/05/195930/how-the-hunt-for-edward-snowden.html#.UdoMtFNngXw">Canary Islands</a>.&nbsp;  While in Austrian airspace, the Bolivian plan received word that Spain  was withdrawing permission to refuel.&nbsp; The aircraft quickly made landing  requests to Portugal, Italy and France.&nbsp; The word back was no  permission to land.&nbsp; With a need to refuel and  no other options, a request was made to Austria and Morales landed in  Vienna.</p>
<p>Once on the ground, Morales was confined to the Vienna air  terminal for hours.&nbsp; Bolivian officials insisted that the Austrians  search the plane for Snowden.&nbsp; An Austrian official walked through the  plane but supposedly <a href="http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/135471/austria-denies-inspecting-morales-plane-during-landing">interrupted the search</a> and left.&nbsp; Austrian President Heinz Fischer said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;The  official was informed that the problem had been fixed and he saw at  that point that the plane was empty&#8230; He did not look under the seats.  There was no formal inspection, but no other person was found aboard.&#8221; <a href="http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/135471/austria-denies-inspecting-morales-plane-during-landing">Austrian President Heinz Fischer, Buenos Ares Herald, July 7</a></p>
<p>Guess what?&nbsp; Snowden was not on the plane.</p>
<p>How  did this happen?&nbsp; Were these European countries so anxious to find  Snowden, they acted in a way that broke international law and  agreements?</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/matt-schofield/">Matthew Schofield</a> of the McClatchy News Foreign Staff, we know that someone contacted  Spanish authorities and authorities in the other refusing nations with  requests that the Bolivian plane not land on their territory (<a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/07/05/195930/how-the-hunt-for-edward-snowden.html#storylink=cpy">How the hunt for Edward Snowden, and bad information, stranded Bolivian president, Friday, July 5, 2013</a>).&nbsp; Schofield connected the dots on critical elements of this story.</p>
<p>The article quotes Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manual Garcia-Margallo who was interviewed after the incident:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;We were told that Snowden was inside. I can [only] work with the data <em>they</em> give me.&nbsp; <em>They</em> said <em>they</em> were clear he was inside. &hellip; The reactions of <em>European countries</em> were because the information they gave us was that (Snowden) was inside.&#8221;&nbsp; Spanish Foreign Minister Garcia-Margallo <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/07/05/195930/how-the-hunt-for-edward-snowden.html#storylink=cpy">McClatchy, July 5</a> (Author&#8217;s emphasis)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s telling!&nbsp; As Schofield points out, the foreign minister didn&#8217;t say who <em>they</em> were but let&#8217;s guess &#8211; an authorized, high-ranking member of the Obama  administration.&nbsp; Who else could make such a request and have it granted?</p>
<p>Also, the foreign minister&#8217;s statement implicates officials in the other three <em>European countries</em>.&nbsp; How else would he know the <em>information</em> he claims to have received?</p>
<p>Is it an international conspiracy to violate protocols on skyjacking yet?</p>
<p>We also find out the obvious reason <em>they</em> thought Morales was on the plane and why that idea was absurd.&nbsp; Schofield implied that <em>they</em> suspected that Morales&#8217; comment about considering asylum meant both  that he would grant it and that the president would sneak Snowden on the  presidential aircraft for a getaway.</p>
<p>Maybe <em>they</em> celebrated a bit too much over the holiday weekend and watched an episode of Fox Entertainment&#8217;s <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_reaction_to_24_%28TV_series%29#Life_imitating_art">24</a></em>.</p>
<p>What would <a href="http://tinyurl.com/kvbqh7w">Jack Bauer</a> do?</p>
<p>If  they had exercised the least bit of objective analysis, it would have  been apparent that the Snowden-Morales escape scenario was extremely  unlikely.</p>
<p>It was public knowledge that Snowden <a href="http://rbth.ru/international/2013/06/23/snowdens_flight_from_hong_kong_lands_at_sheremetyevo_airport_27393.html">landed and was restricted to Moscow&#8217;s Sheremetyevo International Airport</a> on June 23.&nbsp; &nbsp;President Morales&#8217; plane landed and remained at Moscow&#8217;s Vnukovo International Airport prior to the <a href="http://www.gecf.org/pressroom/PressReleaseDetail">Gas Exporting Countries Conference</a>, which started July 1.&nbsp; To believe that there was <em>actionable</em> intelligence to suspect Morales &#8211; Snowden getaway, you have to believe  the following.&nbsp; Snowden could: evade Russian security and leave  Sheremetyevo airport; successfully travel the 35 miles across Moscow to  Vnukovo airport; evade Russian security there; and, board the Morales  plane.</p>
<p>The European countries and the individuals who encouraged  them clearly violated the international conventions on skyjacking and  the general diplomatic code based on a theory that was unlikely at best  and, in reality, absurd.&nbsp; &nbsp;The overwhelming desire to get Snowden seems  to have blocked access to the facts of the situation.</p>
<p>These are the people who are protecting us against terrorist attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Deeper Reasons for <em>Them</em> to Suspect Morales</strong></p>
<p>The  suspicions of the officials who encouraged this absurdity make sense,  if we assume that the Obama administration was behind this, which, of  course, they were. &nbsp;If you&#8217;re sufficiently paranoid, it is easy to  suspect others of doing what you do to them.</p>
<p>Evo Morales is a left  wing Bolivian politician who was first elected president of Bolivian in  2006.&nbsp; He leads a movement that incurred the hostility of Bolivia&#8217;s  financial elite and apparently the United States government under both  Bush and Obama.</p>
<p>The Bush administration&#8217;s hostility toward Morales included <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hYS-16kpcSPUg5j0OrIPoeb-JGLg">trade conflicts</a> and <a href="http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2003/10/boli-o17.html">claims that the administration backed</a> the 2003 massacre of protesters associated with Morales.&nbsp; According to Morales, the U.S. Embassy was <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1891852,00.html">behind a plot</a> to kill him in 2009.&nbsp; <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2009/04/obama-denies-us/">President Obama had to deny</a> approving any assassination plots on a visit to South America.&nbsp; Bolivia recently <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/bolivian-president-morales-shuns-usaid-why-he-may-not-need-money-1231287">turned down</a> any further aid from the United States and expelled U.S. aid personnel.</p>
<p>The  administration knows what it has done and plans to do to Morales and  the nation of Bolivia. &nbsp;If you&#8217;re sufficiently paranoid, it makes  perfect sense to suspect a constant desire for revenge on the part of  those you victimize.&nbsp; As a result, the many reasons to believe Snowden&#8217;s  escape was nearly impossible made no difference.&nbsp; The administration  bypassed the facts altogether and went with the paranoid logic. &nbsp;<em>Of course he snuck Snowden on the plane!&nbsp; He hates our guts!&nbsp; Go get him.</em></p>
<p>While  the deeper reasons theory makes sense, it could be as simple as this.&nbsp;  One of the many friends made by the administration in six years of drone  killings and proxy wars may have injected an email into an Internet  portals monitored by NSA and its European partners stating that Snowden  was on the plane.</p>
<p>This is just another stop on the boulevard of lost dreams that represents out current political process.</p>

<p>Like  the protests in Turkey over the past weeks, this is an urban phenomenon  dominated by the young.&nbsp; Many are college educated and under or  unemployed.&nbsp; For most, these are their first political protests.&nbsp; They  chafe at wasted public expenditures.&nbsp; In Rio, for example, the  government spend millions for an international soccer tournament while  the people idle away with few if any prospects for meaningful employment  or a future.&nbsp; (Image: Brasilia June 20 <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/9098988@N02/9098629686/in/photolist-eS1RBC-eRPpE2-71NY6A-71K1rD-71K2dz-71P3Ls-71NXKN-71NZGh-71NXzU-71K2DR-71K31k-71K3pK-71P1Sb-71JWSV-71JXmD-71K186-71JZcF-71NXDC-71NYQW-71P4xL-71JYsH-eS1Shs-eRPqPt-eRPqHX-eS1Smb-eS1Ss3-eS1SiU-eRFnjL-eRF25E-eRu5za-eRFGwu-eRtzMB-eRFAX5-eRF7EU-eRumNa-eRtKE4-eRu81e-eRug3T-71P49y-eRuaK6-eRupEM-eRFpXE-eRtFwx-dZuMYQ-eQdKR4-eQdKCp-eQq7Ym-eQdLp8-eQdL2D-2TGgP-bCnYy">Semilla Luz)</a></p>

<p>Public  transportation fare increases have been rolled back in Rio, Sao Paolo,  where the protests started, and other cities.&nbsp; The crowds continued to  grow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Demands  expanded from&nbsp; fares to the general state of the economy and lousy  governance.&nbsp; This statement by Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes provides a clue to  the indifference that the people see from the government:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;I  come here after reflecting a lot on the topic, and I demonstrate that  the twenty cents were not made with subsidies. We are going to suspend  the increase that was implemented in the beginning of June. This concurs  with the actions taken by the mayor of S&atilde;o Paulo, Fernando Haddad.  However, we warn that we will have a loss of at least R$200 million for  the city and we will have to redefine our priorities.&#8221; <a href="http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-daily/rio-and-sao-paulo-lower-bus-fares/">Eduardo&nbsp; Paes, Mayor Rio de Janiero, Rio Times, June 20</a></p>
<p>The  Mayor&#8217;s city and country is going up in smoke, massive protests in a  nation not accustomed to mass action, and he&#8217;s been &#8220;reflecting on the  topic.&#8221;&nbsp; What topic?&nbsp; Fare increases.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not about that anymore.&nbsp; The  mayor would know that were he paying attention.&nbsp; Its about a lousy  government that is indifferent to the people.&nbsp; So what does he do.&nbsp; He  decreases fares and, at the same time,&nbsp; warns that other public service  projects will suffer. (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-22992410">Table right:&nbsp; BBC)</a></p>
<p>The mayor doesn&#8217;t get it?&nbsp; Politicians around the world don&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p>The  mass action in Brazil, the sustained protests in Turkey, the union  backed protests in Tahrir Square, and Occupy Wall Street &#8212; these are  all public outpourings by those left out of the workplace; those facing a  future of diminishing opportunities.&nbsp; They know what their leaders are  doing about it.&nbsp; Nothing!</p>
<p>&#8220;No more future&#8221; is simply unacceptable.</p>

<p>The  war in Syria went from a seeming quagmire to a conflict that may reach a  dramatic climax with the coming battle for Aleppo, a city of nearly  three million people that was once the commercial center of the nation.&nbsp;  &nbsp;Political leaders and events in two other cities, Istanbul and London,  will play a central role in the outcome of the battle.&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yeowatzup/5077859404/in/photolist-8JHmG5-8DQmKt-LMgVx-ck6hmu-ck5gqm-ck62zs-dEizs6-aqvYd4-cjzg4Q-7x71Ew-cjyVNs-dKxMfr-a9cp2z-bUE5nC-bUE9LW-bUE3Aj-bUE7UC-7w6eg9-bUD8vA-bUDh5m-bUDn5E-bUDdL7-bUDkdS-csWxvU-99zhE2-99z7yZ-99Cjvm-99CeFu-99CgZu-99Cj95-99CrAL-99CgLJ-99Ch7L-99znn8-99zj8H-99CsiQ-99z78g-99z8JF-99z7mp-99z8jp-925U2c-99Ctts-99z9vD-99ziqR-99CrMY-99CtjQ-99zidF-99zcgF-99zcuT-99zhRR-99CnGE/">Image</a>)</p>
<p>The  Syrian Army finished off final rebel resistance in the city of Qusayr  last week fighting alongside the Lebanese group Hezbollah.&nbsp; As a result,  the rebel supply line from Lebanon is shut down and the major road from  Damascus to Aleppo via Qusayr is open.&nbsp; The road will serve the supply  line for an attack to end rebel occupation of half of that city.</p>
<p>A victory by the Syrian military in <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/middle-east/syria/130610/syrian-assault-aleppo-imminent-government-forces-moun">Operation Northern Storm</a>,  its name for the Aleppo effort, will leave the rebels with very little  in the way of major influence or meaningful territory.&nbsp; From the start,  the rebel strategy focused on urban warfare.&nbsp; The various groups would  have little chance of survival in a conventional battle with the Syrian  Army.&nbsp; With the shelter of cities and towns, the Syrian Army&#8217;s  &nbsp;advantage vanished allowing the rebels to carry on the conflict and  prevail in key areas.</p>
<p><img class="mceWPmore" src="http://agonist.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" border="0" title="More..." /></p>
<p>Damascus  is under government control.&nbsp; With a victory in Aleppo, the Syrian  state would reclaim control of its two key population centers.&nbsp; The  United States &#8211; Russia sponsored peace conference scheduled for July  would be an afterthought.</p>
<p>Two of the key supporters of the Syrian  rebels are not in a position to provide much help the rebels in their  attempt to hold their position in Aleppo.</p>
<p>Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Erdogan is preoccupied with a raging protest movement focused on  the PM and his policies.&nbsp; The movement began and is centered in  Istanbul, the nation&#8217;s largest city and world trade gateway.&nbsp; Turkey  took the lead in public opposition to the Syrian government in 2011.&nbsp;  Its southern border near Aleppo, particularly the city of Adana, served  as the conduit for supplies and fighters from Persian Gulf oil states.</p>
<p>Siding with rebels was <a href="http://www.edam.org.tr/document/Edam2012Survey2.pdf">never popular</a> in Turkey.&nbsp; It is very <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2013/06/turkish-majorities-policies.html">unpopular now</a>.&nbsp; As certain as he may seem about every thing he says, Erdogan would risk a great deal through robust assistance to the rebels.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister David Cameron has a <a href="https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/nowsyrialatestnews/britain-could-sidestep-eu-ban-on-arming-syria-rebels-pm-says">deep commitment</a> to the Syrian rebels.&nbsp; Cameron has steadfastly advocated for a lifting  of European Union ban on the supply of weapons to the rebels.&nbsp; The PM is  limited by <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cameron-faces-serious-cabinet-split-over-over-arming-syrian-rebels-8646433.html">defections</a> from his own party and a split cabinet, with one faction opposed to the  supply of lethal assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oddly, Cameron maintains that it will  take <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cameron-faces-serious-cabinet-split-over-over-arming-syrian-rebels-8646433.html">18 months</a> for the weapons supplies to spread among the rebels.</p>
<p>The  battle for Aleppo will be decided long before the suggested 18 months  is up.&nbsp; The outcome could end the rebels as a viable force that  justifies additional outside aid.</p>
<p><strong>The Battle for Aleppo &#8211; July 2012 through May 2013<br /> </strong></p>
<p>The rebels first <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/key-aleppo-neighbourhood-in-rebel-hands">attacked Aleppo</a> in earnest in <a href="http://www.aawsat.net/2012/07/article55241164">July 2012</a>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to that rebels took control of large sections of the  countryside around the city. &nbsp;The attack originated from a cluster of  towns to the north of the city near the Turkish border or with rebels  embedded in Aleppo.&nbsp; Foreign fighters and Syrian rebels were likely <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/turkey-sets-up-secret-base-to-bring-aid-to-syria-rebels-sources-say-1.454107">trained and supplied</a> in the Turkish city of Adana, just across the Syria-Turkey border.&nbsp;&nbsp; News of the Turkish base first surfaced in July 2012.</p>
<p>Whichever  version of the attack is correct, one thing is for certain.&nbsp; There was  no civil insurrection in Aleppo by citizens of that city.&nbsp; Nor did the  attack come at the request by Aleppo&#8217;s residents.</p>
<p>Currently, the city is divided into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aleppo_%282012%E2%80%9313%29#Battle">three sectors</a> controlled by the rebels, the Syrian military, and Syrian Kurds.&nbsp; &nbsp;The  rebels control the eastern sector and the countryside around the western  sector, which is controlled by the Syrian military.&nbsp; Two Kurdish groups  control a smaller section of the city, the Salahaddin Brigade, which  cooperates with rebels, and the Kurdish Democratic Union Party, distant  from both rebels and the Syrian military.</p>
<p>The successful rebel  offensive in July resulted in control of a large portion of eastern  Aleppo.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the battles raged, Syrian Army troops faced a significant  disadvantage.&nbsp; Rebel control of the city of Qusayr and the Homs province  <a href="http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/sep/20/rebels-unite-in-fight-for-syrias-largest-city/">cut off regular supplies</a> and troop movements to support efforts in Aleppo.</p>
<p><a href="http://agonist.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/aleppo-situation-2013.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-106708 alignright" src="http://agonist.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/aleppo-situation-2013.jpg" border="0" alt="aleppo situation 2013" width="389" height="308" /></a>The  fall of Qusayr changed all that.&nbsp; The Syrian&#8217;s can now supply their  military in Aleppo, knowing that the Lebanese rebel supply pipeline is  closed.&nbsp; In addition, the military has adjusted its fixed battle mindset  for urban warfare into a more efficient approach and, of most  significance; the Syrians are now allied with Hezbollah.&nbsp; The two  fighting groups proved to be a formidable combination.&nbsp; After it was  clear that Qusayr would fall, Hezbollah <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/2013/Jun-04/219388-4000-hezbollah-fighters-reach-rebel-held-aleppo-fsa.ashx#axzz2VKZvqjYB">deployed 4,000</a> fighters to Aleppo for that battle.</p>
<p><strong>Istanbul and London</strong></p>
<p>Turks are protesting in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/turkey-protests-test-obamas-relationship-with-prime-minister-erdogan/2013/06/11/bc841fb0-d26a-11e2-9577-df9f1c3348f5_story.html">80 cities</a> across the country.&nbsp; The eruption of civil discontent started on May 31  when police assaulted protesters in Istanbul&#8217;s Taksim Square.&nbsp; What  started as a protest of plans to change a major square in Istanbul has  grown to a nationwide movement sustained since May 31.&nbsp; The general  themes have broadened to include the opposition to the autocratic rule  of Prime Minister Erdogan, creeping religious rules restricting the  public, and Turkey&#8217;s involvement to the conflict in Syria (see  previously cited polling results).</p>
<p>Erdogan&#8217;s initial reaction to  the protests was disdain calling the protestors &#8220;bums.&#8221; &nbsp;When he left  the country for a visit to North Africa, his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/world/europe/turkey-riots.html?_r=0">Deputy Prime Minister apologized</a> for the violent police reaction in the early protests and met with  demonstrators. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Erdogan returned, he was expected to calm  things.&nbsp; Instead he held <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/09/uk-turkey-protests-idUKBRE94U0JA20130609">rival rallies</a> of his supporters telling crowds that the protestors were &#8220;drinking  beer in mosques and insulting women wearing headscarves.&#8221;&nbsp; These  allegations risked pitting his party supporters against protestors in  violent conflict.</p>
<p>There are three constituencies that openly  oppose Erdogan: supporters of the secular model of rule in Turkey, the  Alevi population, and the Kurds. All together, these three groups  represent close to half of the total population.</p>
<p>A fourth, more dangerous opponent is Fethullah Gulen, leader of the powerful <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/05/erdogan-gulen-struggle.html">Hizmet movement</a>,  a moderate Muslim &#8220;state within a state.&#8221;&nbsp; Gulen opposes Erdogan&#8217;s  commitment to violence in Syria and the Prime Minister&#8217;s overbearing  style of rule.&nbsp; A clear abandonment of Erdogan would be devastating.</p>
<p>Erdogan  alienated the military through the prosecution of several hundred  military leaders for alleged plans for false flag terror operations  against fellow Turks.&nbsp; Yet he relies on the military to further his  program by restraining the type of military coups that have toppled  previous Turkish leaders.</p>
<p>Why would Erdogan risk his rule to  intervene directly in Syria, particularly a battle about to be fought  that could determine the outcome of the rebel assault on Syria&#8217;s  government?&nbsp; And, if he did, would the military cooperate?</p>
<p>There  is no civil unrest beleaguering British Prime Minister David Cameron.&nbsp;  However, his insistence on providing weapons to Syrian rebels is costing  him dearly.&nbsp; Half of his cabinet came out in opposition to any military  aid (although there has been covert aid for some time).&nbsp; &nbsp;Eighty-one <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22815907">Conservative Members</a> of Parliament wrote an open letter to Cameron opposing aid through  weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp; The members demanded a floor debate and vote on any aid  package.</p>
<p>There are even comparisons to Cameron&#8217;s obsession with  the Syrian violence with former PM Tony Blair&#8217;s fixation on invading  Iraq.</p>
<p>Cameron&#8217;s main support on the Syrian project comes from his  neoconservative cabinet members and their allies in the British version  of the Federalist Society, known as the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.henryjacksonsociety.org%2F&amp;ei=Wei2Uaj8Lsio0AGhqYCIAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEL9CSvZiBLmbINsiDj67WfWPpU_g&amp;bvm=bv.47534661,d.dmQ">Henry Jackson Society</a>.</p>
<p>The  PM is isolated politically in his adamant support for aiding the  rebels.&nbsp; His ability to deliver is viewed as extremely limited.</p>
<p>Even  if Erdogan acts without regard to his political future and Cameron has  one, neither leader will be able to provide the time-critical delivery  of what the rebels need to survive the furious onslaught by the Syrian  Army and Hezbollah <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/middle-east/syria/130610/syrian-assault-aleppo-imminent-government-forces-moun">set to begin</a> in the next hours or days.</p>
<p>Since  the conflict began, in victory and defeat, the various factions of the  Syrian rebels have complained bitterly about an absence of weapons and  ammunition.&nbsp;&nbsp; This may be one instance when their complaints are right  on target.&nbsp; If Operation Northern Storm succeeds, this may be the last  request for weapons that the rebels make; or, at least the last request  that anyone bothers to cover.</p>

(<a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c02c.html">Image: UCS</a>)</p>
<p>Coal power is the leading source <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c02c.html">carbon dioxide (CO2)</a> in the atmosphere.&nbsp; CO2 is the leading cause of climate change.&nbsp; Once airborne, the man made filth sticks around for <a href="http://forecast.uchicago.edu/Projects/archer.2009.ann_rev_tail.pdf">2 to 20 centuries</a>.&nbsp; In addition, <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c02c.html">coal power</a> is &#8220;a leading cause of smog, acid rain, and toxic air pollution.&#8221;</p>
<p>All that makes us sick reflected in a an annual health care price tag of <a href="http://solar.gwu.edu/index_files/Resources_files/epstein_full%20cost%20of%20coal.pdf">$333 to&nbsp; $500 billion</a> in costs for heart and lung diseases, for example.&nbsp; Tens of thousands die from those diseases eery year.</p>
<p>Guess  which bank is one of the top financing sources for coal plants and  mountain top removal?&nbsp; JP Morgan.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the same JPMogan that the FERC  may go after (just like the Department of Justice went after those  involved with torture).</p>
<p><img class="mceWPmore" src="http://agonist.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" border="0" title="More..." /></p>
<p>It  is clear that Blythe Masters, head of commodities trading and  regulatory affairs at JPMorgan investment banking, and her Wall Street  cohorts who finance and lobby for coal production do not play well with  others.</p>
<p>Blythe Masters, is in <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/05/02/jpmorgan-caught-in-swirl-of-regulatory-woes/">big trouble</a>.&nbsp;  The New York Times reported that a FERC report says that she lied to  them about a deal and her expertise to squash state investigations.  &nbsp;According to the Times, <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/05/02/jpmorgan-caught-in-swirl-of-regulatory-woes/">FERC alleges</a> that Ms. Masters and her crew made appear that &#8220;money-losing power  plants&#8221; were &#8220;powerful profit centers.&nbsp; Not good for investors.<a href="http://solar.gwu.edu/index_files/Resources_files/epstein_full%20cost%20of%20coal.pdf"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-105284" src="http://agonist.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/coas-health-costs.jpg" border="0" alt="coas health costs" width="261" height="230" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Who is Blythe Masters?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://newsle.com/person/blythemasters/7892161">Masters</a> is a key player and senior executive at JP Morgan.&nbsp; She invented credit  default swaps (CDS).&nbsp; This risky derivative scheme supposedly provides  investors <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap">protection</a></em> against financial default by corporate entities. You don&#8217;t have to own one dime of stock in the corporation to buy <em>protection</em>, you just need the money.</p>
<p>The market size of CDS trading in 2012 was <a href="http://www.bis.org/statistics/otcder/dt21.pdf">$27 trillion</a>.&nbsp; It involves mostly <a href="http://www.bis.org/statistics/otcder/dt27.pdf">foreign trading</a>.&nbsp;  The market is not regulated so all we can do is &#8220;take their word&#8221; on  size and true risk.&nbsp; The market looks more like a protection racket than  a financial service.</p>
<p>CDC trading is followed by a significant increase in <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/01/credit-default-swaps">corporate bankruptcy</a> according to a recent study.&nbsp; Rather than providing protection, product  marketing looks more like a protection racket.&nbsp; Master&#8217;s invention was  central to the <a href="http://georgewashington2.blogspot.com/2009/09/credit-default-swaps-are-still.html">2008 financial</a> <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aa741ba8-0a7e-11de-95ed-0000779fd2ac.html#axzz2SVJjCeOB">crisis</a> and CDS pose <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/2012/05/11/jpmorgan-credit-default-swaps-still-wreaking-havoc/">threats today</a>.</p>
<p>We  can debate the &#8220;great man/person&#8221; theory of history versus other causal  factors all day long.&nbsp; It won&#8217;t change the fact that JPMorgan&#8217;s Blythe  Masters is one extremely influential and dangerous person.&nbsp; She&#8217;s  walking around free as a bird, spending her money, never touched by the  great financial collapse she helped create in 2008.</p>
<p>Our social and political culture is starting to mirror the musical <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLsM6PpOXbA">Chicago</a></em> with one important exception.&nbsp; Nobody ever gets arrested.&nbsp; They bypass that step and move right to notoriety.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Any  project that increases greenhouse gasses above expectations at this  moment in history, particularly a substantial increase, must be  determined an imminent danger to the national interest if the people  living in the nation are an interest in this determination.</em></p>
<p>The United States Department of State called for <a href="http://www.keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/">public comments</a> on construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.&nbsp; The deadline is April 22,  2013 &#8212; Earth Day.&nbsp; Since Keystone is an international project,  Secretary of State John Kerry has authority to decide on starting or  ending the proposed conduit for toxic oil from the Alberta, Canada tar  sands, across the United States, to the Houston area for refining.&nbsp; From  there, the oil goes straight to China.</p>
<p>Tar sands oil produces 17%  more carbon dioxide per barrel than the average barrel of oil.&nbsp; With  China&#8217;s intense demand for fuel, the volume of carbon dioxide pumped  into the atmosphere will increase at a dangerous rate even beyond the  current hazardous rate of pollution.&nbsp; .</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the only person making the arguments that follow.&nbsp; A long list of <a href="http://350.org/scientists-call-president-reject-keystone-xl-pipeline">eminent scientists</a> stand opposed to the project.&nbsp; My comment is likely shorter than theirs  and it&#8217;s from an ordinary, concerned citizen.&nbsp; Take a look and, if you  agree, modify it or send it as is to <a href="mailto:keystonecomments@state.gov">keystonecomments@state.gov</a>. Send your U.S. senators and congressperson a copy as well.</p>
<p>Coping with the outcome of climate change is an extremely serious challenge right now.</p>
<p>Why make it even worse?</p>
<p align="center"><strong>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</strong></p>
<p><strong>Comment on the National Interest Determination &#8211; Keystone XL Pipeline</strong></p>
<p>The  March 13, 2013 Keystone Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  specifies the influence of Alberta, Canada&#8217;s tar sands heavy crude oil  on climate change.&nbsp; Tar sands oil produces 17% more greenhouse gasses  than the average barrel of oil. (1)&nbsp; While the EIS assessed &#8220;Climate  Change Effects on the Project,&#8221; the impact of increased greenhouse  gasses on citizens of United States was not addressed.&nbsp; This impact is  the essence of any national interest determination that examines  Keystone XL and similar projects.</p>
<p><img class="mceWPmore" src="http://agonist.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" border="0" title="More..." /></p>
<p>The  EIS concludes that since nearly the same volume of Alberta tar sands  crude oil will be transported to refineries without the Keystone XL  pipeline, denying project approval would have only a marginal impact on  tar sands oil production and, by implication, greenhouse gas emissions.  (2)</p>
<p>Based on the explicit admission of 17% greater greenhouse  gasses per barrel from Keystone XL, the Secretary of State must deny  approval of the pipeline even if every single assertion in the  Environmental Impact Statement stands up to challenges by opponents.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Any  project that increases greenhouse gasses above expectations at this  moment in history, particularly a substantial increase, must be  determined an imminent danger to the national interest if the people  living in the nation are an interest in this determination.</p>
<p>The  EIS conclusion that since other methods of transport are available  therefore Keystone XL has only a marginal impact on greenhouse gas  emissions is tragically flawed logic.&nbsp; How would we react if the Drug  Enforcement Administration passed up an opportunity to shut down one of  the nation&#8217;s largest meth labs because other sources of crystal meth  would soon rise up to meet demand?</p>
<p>What impact will the 17%  increase in greenhouse gasses have on the stability of the earth&#8217;s  climate?&nbsp; A 2 degree C increase in global temperature is the consensus  limit before life in parts of the United States becomes intolerable due  climate events. (3)(4)&nbsp; Extreme climate events today will be tomorrow&#8217;s  normal if that limit is exceeded. (5)(6)&nbsp;&nbsp; The atmosphere can tolerate  an additional 430 billion metric tons of carbon before breaching the 2  degree barrier.&nbsp; Based on estimates that did not include Alberta tar  sands oil, that limit will be reached in the summer of 2041. (7)</p>
<p>Complete  extraction of Alberta tar sands oil will produce 198 billion metric  tons of carbon above and beyond the original estimates &#8212; 46% of the  total carbon left before the 2 degree tipping point is reached.&nbsp; Just  with today&#8217;s technology, 22 billion metric tons of carbon will be added  to the total produced &#8212; around 5% of the remaining total.</p>
<p>The  rate of climate change is accelerating. (8) &nbsp;&nbsp;The 2 degree C target  seems unrealistic providing an even stronger rationale to stop the toxic  flow of Keystone XL.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;">This  article takes a close look at the legislation just passed by Congress  and signed by President Obama allowing the Secretary of Agriculture to  issue executive orders that bypass regulations, safety, and science for  the purpose of speeding genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and  genetically engineered seeds (GE) and crops to market.&nbsp; The way the law  is written, Secretary Tom Vilsack can lift restrictions on GMOs for a  set period and, it appears, do so without hindrance from the courts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;">Are  genetically modified organisms (GMOs), seeds, and crops&nbsp; safe for human  consumption?&nbsp; How has the scientific testing of these seeds been  conducted and what are the results?&nbsp; Is there undue influence of the  government and legislative process to fast track the delivery of GMOs to  market?&nbsp; Who benefits from that influence, if it is present, and how  are the benefits derived?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;"><img class="mceWPmore" src="http://agonist.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" border="0" title="More..." /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;">There  is a claimed scientific consensus that GMOs are safe for food  production but there are detractors and the general public is wary.&nbsp; <span><a href="http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/food-how-altered/">Most of us</a> have or are eating food from <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/curiosity/topics/10-genetically-modified-food-products.htm">genetically</a> engineered seeds and crops.&nbsp; In the U.S., <a href="http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/agri_biotechnology/gmo_planting/506.usa_cultivation_gm_plants_2009.html">88% of the maize and soybeans </a>are from genetically modified seeds.&nbsp; These seeds are called &#8220;green seeds&#8221; to ride the environmental band wagon.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll <a href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/124/2/487.full">solve world hunger </a>too,  according to some biotech advocates.&nbsp; A review of studies on crop  yields, however, shows that the impact of GMO&#8217;s the actual yield of  crops is <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_agriculture/our-failing-food-system/genetic-engineering/failure-to-yield.html">not significant</a>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;">There  can be little doubt that the legislation neuters the principles of open  law making and government and scientific requirements for distribution  of GMOs and GE seeds and crops, legislation tucked away in the budget  act just passed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;">There is no doubt that a leader in corporate food  technology, Monsanto, is well represented in the Obama administration.&nbsp;  In 2010, the president appointed <span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/health/policy/14fda.html?_r=0">Mark Taylor</a>,  former Monsanto Vice President and lobbyist, as the Food and Drug  Administration&#8217;s food safety division.&nbsp; That&#8217;s real influence.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;">The beneficiaries of this legislation are clear.&nbsp; Whenever they come up with a very special <em>Franken-gene</em>,  Monsanto, Lilly, etc., are off the hook and ready to roll without  obstacles.&nbsp; They just need a special order rubber stamped document&nbsp; from  the Secretary of Agriculture.&nbsp; If he&#8217;s too busy, they&#8217;ll write it for  him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;">The following analysis of the specific legislation is  important.&nbsp; A review of the actual language shows how the turn of a  phrase in a back room can make the U.S. government a partner in the  furtherance of GMOs or any other product or service from an industry or  group with the money and power to get things done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;">The passage below is from the March 20, 2013 budget bill, the focus of controversy.&nbsp; If you read the language marked in <strong>bold</strong> <strong>print</strong> as one statement, you get a sentence (of sorts) that says the Secretary  of Agriculture &#8220;shall&#8221; issue regulations to override impediments (e.g.,  court rulings) to the distribution and marketing of GMO&#8217;s and  genetically engineered crops.&nbsp; The details of the linguistic slight of  hand are explained after the passage.</span></p>

<p>(Washington,  DC 1/17)&nbsp; The nation&#8217;s capital hosted over 40,000 citizens assembled to  petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&nbsp; The crowd urged  President Obama to bring to reality his lofty words on climate change in  the inaugural address just days ago.&nbsp; By stopping the construction of  the Keystone XL pipeline, the president would deal a blow to the rogue  energy&nbsp;companies who, by their actions, are ready to sacrifice  everything to transport oil from Alberta, Canada&#8217;s tar sands, across the  United States, for refinement in Houston, Texas and shipment to China.</p>
<p>The broader concern of the gathered citizens and march sponsors, <a href="http://350.org/en/understanding-350">350.org</a>,  and the Sierra Club, represents the existential issue of our time.&nbsp; We  need to get very real, very soon on the manifest threat to the earth&#8217;s  climate posed by fossil fuels and the threat to the human species  embodied by insane ventures like the Canadian tar sands project.&nbsp; The  verdict of science is clear.&nbsp; As leading climate scientist James E.  Hansen said, the full exploitation of tar sands oil and use by China, or  any nation, is &#8220;game over for the climate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Citizens gathered at  the Washington Monument, where speakers outlined the last chance  scenario for reversing climate change.&nbsp; While nowhere near the entire  solution, stopping the Keystone XL pipeline offers the biggest win in  the war for survival.&nbsp; <a href="http://350.org/en/bill">Bill McKibben</a>,  founder of 350.org, opened the program with the demand that President  Obama live up to his campaign rhetoric and stop the pipeline from  crossing the Canadian border.&nbsp; That action would devastate the corporate  partnership of Enbridge, TransCanada, and the other vultures seeking to  profit at the expense of everyone else.&nbsp; Michael Brune, executive  director of the Sierra Club, argued that the coal and oil industries are  on the run.&nbsp; He cited energy use estimates for Texas, Colorado, and  other states that show 30% of energy needs will be met by alternative  fuels.&nbsp; Brune chained himself to the White House fencing February 14 in  the Sierra Club&#8217;s first sanctioned act of <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/Energy-Voices/2013/0214/Keystone-XL-pipeline-protest-marks-first-civil-disobedience-by-Sierra-Club">civil disobedience in 120 years.<img class="mceWPmore" src="http://www.themoneyparty.org/main/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" border="0" title="More..." /></a></p>
<p>Senator  Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) told the crowd that this is our time to stop  the tragedy of allowing the filthiest energy source in the world to  cross our borders.&nbsp; There were representatives from the Latino and  Africa American communities plus officials from Canada&#8217;s First Nations  peoples in Alberta and British Columbia.&nbsp; Chief Jackie Thomas and  Crystal Lamemon spoke eloquently about the need for cross cultural,  multinational alliances.&nbsp; The struggles of native peoples in Alberta  near the tar sands mining and the British Columbia transit path were  graphically detailed.</p>
<p>The 40,000 gathered then marched from the  monument to the White House, where they gathered and sent their message  to the president &#8212; do not approve this pipeline.&nbsp; The most common chant  from the crowd was, <em>Hey Obama, we don&#8217;t want no climate drama.</em></p>

<p><strong>Dangers Posed by the Full Exploitation of Canadian Tar Sands and Other High Risk Fossil Fuel Resources</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>&#8220;</strong><strong>Canada&rsquo;s tar sands, deposits of sand saturated with bitumen [</strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphalt"><strong>asphalt</strong></a><strong>], contain <span style="text-decoration: underline;">twice the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by global oil use in our entire history</span>.&#8221;&nbsp; James E. Hansen, PhD, head of NASA Institute for Space Studies</strong></p>
<p>The  least controversial estimate of human tolerance for increases in carbon  dioxide was set at 565 billion additional GtCO2 (Gigatons of carbon  dioxide) released into the atmosphere.&nbsp; Once that limit is exceeded, the  climate will be sufficiently damaged to produce a regular parade of <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/climate_landuse/clu_rd/pt_abrupt_cc.asp">climate catastrophes</a>.&nbsp; The crises will be more frequent and intense due to storms, <a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=252712">floods</a>, <a href="http://www.climatecodered.org/2010/09/what-would-3-degrees-mean.html">droughts</a>, and the loss of <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-03/uoia-spl032511.php">arable farm land</a>, <a href="http://daraint.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/CVM2ndEd-FrontMatter.pdf">famine</a>, and <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp0912931">disease</a>.&nbsp;  These calamities will accelerate human suffering and death.&nbsp; The  shortages in food and the disruptions to economies are the essential  ingredients for riots, civil war, regional, and world wars.</p>
<p>The  general consensus is that there remains oil, coal and other fuel  deposits that if burned would emit 2,795 GtCO2 into the atmosphere.&nbsp;  That&#8217;s five times the outside limit leading to global disaster.</p>
<p>These are not controversial claims.&nbsp; In fact, the limit of 500 million tons of additional CO2 in the atmosphere <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2011/12/06/two-degree-global-warming-limit-is-called-a-prescription-for-disaster/">may be too high</a>.&nbsp;  Without any question whatsoever, we face a reckoning with the chemistry  and physics of climate change.&nbsp; For a more in depth review, see these  reports. (reference?)</p>
<p>There are climate change deniers that  challenge reality.&nbsp; Their work doesn&#8217;t make it into scientific journals  because the deniers are not doing science; thus they lack evidence to  justify their claims.&nbsp; They are part of a well-funded public relations  campaign to raise doubts about the clear and present danger facing  people everywhere.&nbsp; These pseudo scientists publish in an online  Potemkin Village of energy-industry-sponsored association journals that,  for all appearances, look just like real scientific journals.&nbsp; Bigh  quality graphics and environmentally friendly trade names cannot cover  the poverty of evidence and arguments served up in this toxic brew of  disinformation.</p>
<p>The relentless effort to put lipstick on the pig  of climate change denial is aided by the major media organizations which  claim there are two sides to every story.&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Following this  logic, we would have seen stories like, &#8220;Hurricane Katrina &#8211; Tragic  disaster or chance to form lasting relationships?&#8221; or &#8220;Famine in Africa &#8211;  Lost lives or population control?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Obama&#8217;s Decision</strong></p>
<p>This  president was first elected with the promise of ending the Iraq and  Afghanistan wars&nbsp; and reviving a collapsed economy with a true  unemployment rate of over 20% (when you actually count those  unemployed).&nbsp; Many expected that the crooks that collapsed the economy  through their reckless scheming would face legal action or, at the very  least,&nbsp; stop receiving bonuses with our tax dollars for their greed and  stupidity.&nbsp; We all know how well that worked out.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s  reelection had more to do with his hapless opponent, Mitt Romney, who  made mistake after mistake.&nbsp; The election looked closer than expected  and then we saw the mega storm, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnzogby/2012/11/14/after-sandy-poll-shows-gop-faces-growing-environmental-divide-with-voters/">Sandy</a> just before Election Day. New York City <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/nyregion/bloomberg-endorses-obama-saying-hurricane-sandy-affected-decision.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">Mayor Michael Bloomberg</a> endorsed of the president arguing that Obama was, the more likely of  the two candidates to take &#8220;immediate action&#8221; on climate change.&nbsp; Obama  is, indeed, no Mitt Romney.&nbsp; But since the election, the president&#8217;s  effort on climate change is another matter.</p>
<p>Where&#8217;s the national  or international crash project to conserve energy, clean up current CO2  &nbsp;sources, and develop alternatives? Did we all miss something?</p>
<p>Where  was the rousing rhetoric from the inaugural address over the past four  years?&nbsp; Where was the public education required to bury the climate  change deniers once and for all?&nbsp; Don&#8217;t the people have the right to  know the truth?</p>
<p>It is safe to assume that the president&#8217;s concern  for the environment is enhanced to semi-believable only in the face of  his opposition, the climate change deniers and those in the financial  and corporate elite who bankroll that operation.&nbsp; Obama, at best, is  dispassionate about the perils of climate change and, at worst,  cynical.&nbsp; There is no evidence over the past four years that the  president sees any urgency to act.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v474/autorank/Optimized-org3_zpsb4489274.jpg" border="0" width="569" height="400" /></p>
<p><strong>Some reasons why the president may approve the pipeline</strong></p>
<p>Obama wanted to nominate Susan Rice for Secretary of State.&nbsp; Ms. <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/Susan-Rice-s-Conflict-of-I-by-Michael-Collins-121129-766.html">Rice was holding an array</a> of stocks and investments in the Alberta tar sands digging and pipeline  related companies.&nbsp; Surely, Obama was informed of this fact.&nbsp; As  Secretary of State, Rice would have held the final recommendation on the  project since it is an international effort.</p>
<p>Obama has no core  belief system.&nbsp; He was antiwar but then decided to take years to appear  to shut down Iraq.&nbsp; He got NATO to wage a war of aggression in Libya.&nbsp;  The administration has fostered a civil war in Syria that has so far  failed only because the Libyan formula for regime change wasn&#8217;t allowed  by the United Nations.&nbsp; He&#8217;s for civil rights but has drones killing  people, including U.S. citizens, around the world.&nbsp; He&#8217;s pro labor but  failed to do anything for union rights.</p>
<p>Why should it be any different on the environment?&nbsp; It hasn&#8217;t so far.</p>
<p>Obama  doesn&#8217;t want to take the political hit for losing the jobs that  Keystone XL might provide.&nbsp; He has done little to confront the massive  unemployment rate and this might get him in some trouble.</p>
<p>At the  start of this debate, Obama said that the tar sands oil would be  exported to China somehow even if he blocked the U.S. transit route.&nbsp;  Why not get some jobs for citizens if it&#8217;s going to happen anyway, Obama  led us to believe.</p>
<p><strong>There are a number of reasons and indicators that Obama will nix the deal.</strong></p>
<p>President Obama received <a href="http://ncronline.org/blogs/eco-catholic/obamas-first-climate-test-keystone-xl-pipeline">open letters</a> supporting pipeline approval from the U.S. House of Representatives and  Senate with signature totals of 145 and 53 respectively.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a less  than that 33% of House members and a little over 50% of the Senate.&nbsp;  These are not overwhelming numbers for public letters.&nbsp; That represents  the opportunity to stick it to his most rabid opponents in the House and  Senate and solidify the public majority for environmental progress.</p>
<p>When the tar-sands-friendly <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/Susan-Rice-s-Conflict-of-I-by-Michael-Collins-121129-766.html">Susan Rice</a> was nixed for Secretary of State, the president nominated then Senator  John Kerry.&nbsp; Kerry was not nominated based on a pro-environment record  but, as the secretary, he has the final say on approving the Keystone XL  pipeline since it originates in Canada and transits the U.S.&nbsp; (One  would think that EPA would make the decision but, after all, this is  Washington, D.C.)</p>
<p>Kerry has a <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/domestic/John_Kerry_Environment.htm">generally pro-environment position</a> and seeks to appear that way when he&#8217;s not.&nbsp; With his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, the secretary of state wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001G8WR7E/issues2000org/"><em>This Moment on Earth</em></a><em>,</em> an argument for pro-environment policies and an appreciation for  activists and innovators working for clean energy.&nbsp; Kerry is no  candidate for membership in the <a href="http://earth-liberation-front.org/">Earth Liberation Front</a> but he&#8217;s a lot closer to environmental awareness than the volatile Susan Rice and his new boss.</p>
<p>Obama  may move out of his grandiosity enough to realize that he can&#8217;t tap  dance around the issue of climate change any longer and hope to survive  his presidency with the support of a large, ardent faction of  environmentally aware citizens.&nbsp; This is a litmus test, a gut-check that  will determine how millions will see the president.&nbsp; He survived past  wavering on vital issues due to the atrocious nature and policies of his  opposition.&nbsp;&nbsp; This time, the decision is all his.&nbsp; There will be no  crazy Senators threatening a filibuster or delaying legislation.&nbsp; The  buck stops right in the middle of the president&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>Sadly,  there shouldn&#8217;t even be a decision to make at this point.&nbsp; This decision  should have been preempted by an announcement sometime after his first  election.&nbsp; Obama could have outlined the threat climate change poses to  people everywhere.&nbsp; He could have buried the deniers with the force of  science and strong arguments.&nbsp; And he could have let everyone know that  failure to take climate change seriously was suicide for those alive in  15 to 20 years and an act of assault and battery against others who will  suffer due to the willful, nihilistic, deranged notion that we can  continue with business as usual in our treatment of the environment and  our policy-making process.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a matter of Earth in the  balance.&nbsp; The earth will survive, no matter what we do.&nbsp; The real issue  is making every effort humanly possible to save the environment in order  to maintain a livable habitat for human beings.&nbsp; If we&#8217;re fortunate  enough to have more time, then there is no excuse for delay on the  obvious decision on this and other urgent efforts.</p>
<p>The Keystone XL  pipeline must be rejected today.&nbsp; The overwhelming, indisputable truth  about the dangers of climate change must be revealed with great  urgency.&nbsp; The game playing and lying need to stop right now.&nbsp; Anything  less is beyond comprehension and beneath contempt.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Senate Democratic Majority Harry Reid is a rat of  epic proportions.&nbsp; He was the only member of the Democratic majority who  voted against cloture on the filibuster now in place by Senate  Republicans.&nbsp; Reid earned his latest rat tail for two acts against the  citizens of this country.&nbsp; First, of course, is the vote against  cloture, thus allowing the Republicans to block the Hagel nomination.&nbsp;  Reid was <em>forced</em> into this vote by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/us/politics/leading-senate-republicans-set-to-block-hagel.html?_r=0">parliamentary rules</a> which Reid himself created.&nbsp; Before that, Reid assured the survival of  the filibuster by refusing to curtail the odious process when he wrote  the rules for this session of the Senate.<img class="mceWPmore" src="http://www.themoneyparty.org/main/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" border="0" title="More..." /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As  the consummate insider, there is little doubt that Reid knew about the  likely Hagel choice for Defense before he made his decision on the  filibuster rules.&nbsp; Crafty, isn&#8217;t he. (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/donkeyhotey/6056446510/">Image: DonkeyHotey</a>)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What&#8217;s  with this guy?&nbsp; The opposition to Chuck Hagel for Secretary of Defense  comes from the warmonger supporters of the national security state.&nbsp; On  this nomination, they got their marching orders from the <em>pro-Israel at any cost </em>fanatics  who worship at the shrine of endless war.&nbsp; Absent Hagel&#8217;s even handed  view of U.S. Middle East policies and interests, his nomination would  have been approved about the same time as that of new Secretary of State  John Kerry.&nbsp;<img src="http://agonist.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" border="0" title="More..." /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The war mongers are naked before the public.&nbsp; Andrew Kreig, head of the Justice Integrity Project noted:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Hagel&#8217;s  confirmation has become a memorable battle, in part because many of his  opponents are strongly pro-war while always having avoided themselves  the kind of sacrifice Hagel exhibited. Hagel, from modest means in  Nebraska, was seriously wounded two times in Vietnam after enlisting  with his brother, Thomas. They were not only a rare combination of  siblings in the same combat unit, but they also saved each others&#8217;  lives.&#8221; <a href="http://www.justice-integrity.org/faq/438-gop-hammers-key-obama-cabinet-cia-nominees">Andrew Kreig, February, 14</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Chuck  Hagel offers a unique perspective on defense.&nbsp; He&#8217;s not an armchair  warrior.&nbsp; He enlisted and served in Vietnam with distinction.&nbsp; He learned  the deadly serious nature of war, a lesson not forgotten.&nbsp; Hagel started  his own business and, unlike the plutocrats who run the country, he is a  self-made success.&nbsp; His financial inheritance was limited but clearly,  he acquired a strong work ethic. Hagel served in the Senate and openly  questioned the greatest foreign policy disaster in U.S. history, the  illegal invasion of Iraq.&nbsp; In addition, unlike the warmonger right wing  Republicans, Hagel has a history of strong support for our soldiers both  by opposing the reckless use of the military which leads to deaths and  injuries and by supporting the care for injured soldiers once they  return home from foreign adventures.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Harry Reid, on the other  hand, is the epitome of just about everything that&#8217;s wrong with our  political process.&nbsp; The senator from Nevada led the Democrats from one  failure to another as both majority and minority leader.&nbsp; He showed his  true hostility toward the people by supporting the <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0312-03.htm">2005 bankruptcy reform bill</a> that stacked the deck against tens of millions who have been victimized  by Wall Street and the big banks.&nbsp; Reid was happy to support the  evisceration of the Constitution whenever he had the chance.&nbsp;&nbsp; His  string of losses to the forces of privilege and greed would put the old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Generals#Beating_the_Harlem_Globetrotters">Washington Generals</a> to shame.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Elitists  who mock the wisdom of the people fail to note that the vast majority  of citizens see our current political situation with clear vision and  unassailable judgment.&nbsp; Only <a href="http://pollingreport.com/CongJob.htm">14% approve of Congress</a> with an overwhelming 77% stating their disapproval.&nbsp; If you own or work  for a business of any size and 77% of the public disapproves of your  products and services, you know that your headed out of business very  soon&nbsp; It makes sense.&nbsp; People won&#8217;t do business with you.&nbsp; However, due  to the rigged game of U.S. politics, we are stuck with the biggest  collection of incompetents imaginable, people we&#8217;ve identified as losers  again and again over the past years; but, people we&#8217;re stuck with,  nonetheless.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The sad lesson is this.&nbsp; Members of Congress don&#8217;t  care.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t have to.&nbsp; It&#8217;s all a rigged game.&nbsp; Those with the  deepest pockets offer legal bribes in all forms to members of Congress  and those members vote the party line, that would be <a href="http://www.themoneyparty.org/main/the-money-party-series-by-michael-collins/">The Money Party</a> line &#8212; that all inclusive party with its Democratic and Republican  wings that exists solely to serve the interests of the super wealthy and  powerful, at the expense of the people.</p>

			<p><strong>Speech by Laurent Louis &#8211; <em>Posted by Michael Collins</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;It is about time to stop lying to us and treating people like imbeciles.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v474/autorank/Articles/Optimized_laurent_louismp_zpsc059e9df.jpg" border="0" alt="Laurent Louis" title="Belgium, Parliament" /></p>
<p><em>Tearing  Down the Empire Project:&nbsp; This speech represents a moment of extreme  truth for the NATO powers. The United States, Great Britain, France and  the lesser powers have been throwing their weight around Asia and Africa  without regard to the norms of civilized behavior Their drill includes  attacking countries that pose no threat to any NATO member; engaging in  ruinious sanctions as a negotiating tool; threatening war; and, engaging  in military actions as a matter of routine. Laurent Louis, a Belgian MP  and crusader for human rights, spoke to parliament and laid out the  truth behind naked aggression and the lies that justify it. Michael  Collins<br /> <em>(Originally found at <a href="http://kennysideshow.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-greatest-speech-by-western.html">Kenny&#8217;s Sideshow</a>)</em><br /> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><em>============</em><br /> </em></p>
<p><strong>LAURENT LOUIS, MP: Thank you, Mr President. Dear Ministers, dear Colleagues.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Belgium is indeed the land of surrealism. </strong></p>
<p>This  morning we learned from the media that the Belgian army is incapable of  fighting some extremist soldiers having radical Islamist beliefs  existing within its own ranks but who cannot be dismissed for lack of  legal means.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, we decide to help France  in its war against &#8220;Terror&#8221; by providing logistical support for its  operation in Mali. What wouldn&#8217;t we do in order to fight against  terrorism outside our borders? I just hope we took care not to send for  this anti-terrorist operation, in Mali, these much talked about Belgian  Islamists soldiers!</p>
<p>I seem to be joking, but what is going on in  the world today does not make me laugh at all. It doesn&#8217;t make me laugh,  because without any doubt, the leaders of our Western countries are  taking the people for imbeciles with the help and support of the Media  which are nothing more today than an organ of propaganda of the ruling  powers.</p>
<p>Around the world, military actions and regime&#8217;s  destabilization are becoming more and more frequent. Preventive war has  become the rule.</p>
<p>And today, in the name of democracy and the fight  against terrorism, our states grant themselves the right to violate the  sovereignty of independent countries and to overthrow legitimate  leaders.<img class="mceWPmore" src="http://www.themoneyparty.org/main/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" border="0" title="More..." /></p>
<p>There  has been Iraq and Afghanistan, the wars of the American lie. Later,  came Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, where thanks to your decisions, our country  has been &#8220;first in line&#8221; to participate in crimes against humanity, in  each case overthrowing progressive and moderate regimes and to replace  them with Islamist regimes, and &#8211; isn&#8217;t it weird ? &#8211; Their first act was  to impose Sharia law.</p>
<p>This is exactly what is currently happening  in Syria where Belgium is shamefully funding the arming of the Islamist  rebels who are trying to overthrow Bashar Al Assad. Thus, in the midst  of economic crisis, as more and more</p>
<p>Belgians can no longer house  themselves, feed, heat and cure themselves &#8211; Yeah, I can hear what a  filthy populist I am &#8211; well, the Minister of Foreign Affairs decided to  offer the Syrian rebels nine million Euros!</p>
<p>Of course, they&#8217;ll try  to make us believe that this money will be used for humanitarian  purposes &#8230; one more lie! And as you can see, for months, our country  is only participating to put in place, Islamic regimes in North Africa  and the Middle East. So, when they come and pretend to go to war in  order to fight against terrorism in Mali, well&#8230; I feel like laughing.  It&#8217;s false!</p>
<p>Under the appearance of good actions, we only  intervene to defend financial interests in a complete neo-colonialist  agenda. It makes no sense to go to help France in Mali in the name of  the fight against Islamic terrorism when &#8211; at the same time &#8211; we support  the overthrow of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad by Islamist rebels  who want to impose Sharia Law, as was done in Tunisia and in Libya.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>It is about time to stop lying to us and treating people like imbeciles.</strong></p>
<p>The  time has come to tell the truth. Arming the Islamist Rebels, as  Westerners have, in the past armed Bin Laden, that friend of the  Americans before they turned against him, well, the western countries  are taking the opportunity to place military bases in the newly  conquered countries while favoring domestic companies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/What-if-the-Empire-Project-by-Michael-Collins-120814-198.html"><img class="alignright" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v474/autorank/aleppoaljazerraop.jpg" border="0" title="Welcome to the New Syria" width="297" height="290" /></a></p>
<p>Everything  is therefore strategic. In Iraq, our American allies have put their  hands on the country&#8217;s oil wealth. In Afghanistan, it was its opium and  drugs always useful when it comes to make lots of money pretty quickly.  In Libya, in Tunisia, in Egypt, or then again in Syria, the aim was &#8211;  and is still today, to overthrow moderate powers, to replace them with  Islamist powers who very quickly will become troublesome and who we will  shamelessly attack pretending once again, to fight terrorism or protect  Israel.</p>
<p>Thus, the next targets are already known. Within a few months, I bet that our eyes will turn to Algeria and eventually to Iran.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>To  go to war, to free people from an outside aggressor, is noble. But to  go to war to defend the interests of the USA; To go to war to defend the  interests of big companies such as AREVA; go to war to put our hands on  gold mines, is not at all noble and reveals our counties to be  attackers and thugs!</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">No  one dares to speak, but I will not shut up! And if my battle makes me  look like an enemy of this system that flaunts the Human Rights in the  name of financial, geo-strategic and neo-colonialist interests, so be  it!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Flaunting  and exposing this regime is a duty and makes me proud. And honestly, I  apology for my low class speech, but I say fuck you all, the so-called  do-gooders, both left and right-wingers or from the center who are today  licking the boots of our corrupted powers and who will be pleased to  ridicule me.</p>
<p>I say fuck you all, leaders who are playing with your  bombs as kids do in a playground! I say fuck you, you who pretend to be  democrats while you are nothing more than low class criminals.</p>
<p>I  don&#8217;t have much respect neither for the journalists who have the  audacity to label the opponents as mentally retarded while basically,  they know very well that these opponents are right.</p>
<p>Finally, I  despise, at the highest point, those who believe they are the kings of  the world and who are dictating their laws, because I AM on the side of  truth, the side of justice, the side of the innocent victims of looting  at all cost. And it is for this reason that I have decided to clearly  oppose this resolution that is sending our country to support France in  its neo-colonialist operation.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the French  operation, the lie was established. We are told that France is only  answering the call for help of a Malian president. We almost forget that  this president has no legitimacy and that he was put in place to ensure  the transition following the coup of March 2012. Who supported this  coup d&#8217;&eacute;tat? Who started it? For whom is this president of transition  actually working? This is the first lie!</p>
<p>The French president,  Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande dares to pretend to wage this war to fight against the  jihadists who threaten (ohhhh do you realize!) who threaten the French  and European territory! But what an ugly lie! By taking this official  argument, while taking the opportunity to frighten the population  increasing the terror alert level, implementing the Vigipirate plan our  leaders and media are demonstrating an unimaginable outrage!</p>
<p>How  dare they use such a point while France and Belgium have not hesitated  to arm and support Jihadists in Libya and that these same countries  continue to support these jihadists in Syria.</p>
<p>This pretext is a  coverup to strategic and economic purposes. Our countries are no longer  in fear of appearing inconsistent because everything is done to hide it.  But the inconsistency is apparent. It is not tomorrow that you&#8217;ll see a  Malian citizen commit an act of terrorism in Europe. No! Not unless we  suddenly create one so we can justify this military operation.</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t  we created September 11 after all, to justify the invasions, arbitrary  arrest, torture and massacre of innocent populations? Thus, to create a  Malian terrorist is no big deal!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>It must not be very complicated for our bloodthirsty leaders.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Another  pretext used these recent months to justify military operations, as the  protection of human rights. Ah! This pretext is still used today to  justify the war in Mali. But yes! We have to act, otherwise the evil  Islamists will impose Sharia law in Mali, stoning women and cutting the  thugs&#8217; hands off.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Oh!  The intention is truly noble. Noble and salutary for sure. But then why  is it &#8211; Good Lord &#8211; why is it that our countries have contributed in  Tunisia and Libya to the accession to power of Islamists who have  decided to apply this Sharia Law in these countries which were, not so  long ago, still regarded as modern and progressive? I invite you to ask  the young Tunisians who have launched the revolution in Tunisia, if they  are happy with their current situation? This is all hypocrisy.</strong></p>
<p>The  purpose of this war in Mali is very clear. And since no one talks about  it, I WILL. The purpose is to fight against China and allow our  American ally to maintain its presence in Africa and the Middle East.  This is what guides these neo-colonialists operations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/War-Crimes-In-Libya--The-by-Michael-Collins-111103-717.html"><img class="alignleft" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v474/autorank/Articles/libyasirte_zps9021084b.jpg" border="0" alt="Sirte - Libya" title="Where did my home go?" width="264" height="291" /></a></p>
<p>And  you will see, when the military operation will be over, France will, of  course, keep its military bases in Mali. These bases will be a benefit  to the Americans as well. And at the same time, as has always been the  case, western corporations will put their hands on juicy contracts that  will once again deprive re-colonized countries of their wealth and raw  materials.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s be clear, the primary beneficiaries of this  military operation, will be the owners and shareholders of the French  giant <strong>AREVA </strong>who has been trying for years to obtain a uranium mine in Falea, a town of 17,000 inhabitants located at 350 km from Bamako.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t know why, but my little finger is telling me that it won&#8217;t take long before <strong>AREVA </strong>will eventually exploit that mine!</p>
<p>I  don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s an impression I have. It is therefore out of question  that I would take part to this mining colonialism, this modern times  colonialism.</p>
<p>And for those who doubt about my arguments, I sincerely invite them to learn about the wealth of Mali.</p>
<p>Mali  is a major producer of gold, but recently it has been recently  designated as being a country that offers a world-class environment for  the exploitation of uranium. How strange!</p>
<p>One step closer to a war against Iran, it is obvious.</p>
<p>For  all these reasons and in order to not fall into the traps of lies they  are tending us, I&#8217;ve decided not to give my support to that intervention  in Mali.</p>
<p>Therefore, I will vote against it. And by doing so, I&#8217;m  being consistent since, I never supported in the past our criminal  interventions in Libya or in Syria, and so being the only MP in this  country to defend the non-interference and the fight against obscure  interests. I really think it is about time to put an end to our  participation to the UN or NATO and get out of the EU if Europe, instead  of providing peace, providing peace becomes a weapon of attack and  destabilization of sovereign countries submissive to financial rather  than human interests</p>
<p>Finally, I can only urge our government to  remind the President Hollande the obligations resulting from the Geneva  Conventions regarding the respect of prisoners of war.</p>
<p>Indeed, I  was shocked to hear on television from the mouth of the French President  that his intention was to &#8220;destroy&#8221; &#8211; I say &#8220;destroy&#8221; &#8211; Islamist  terrorists.</p>
<p>So, I do not want the qualification to be used to name  the opponents to the Malian regime &#8211; it is always convenient today to  talk about Islamic terrorists- to be used to circumvent the obligations  of any democratic state in terms of respecting the rights of prisoners  of war.</p>
<p>We expect such a respect from the Fatherland of Human  Rights. In conclusion, Let me emphasize how lightly we decide to go to  war.</p>
<p>First, the government acts without any consent from the  Parliament. It appears that it has the right to. It sends equipment, men  to Mali. The Parliament subsequently reacts and when it responds, as  today, well, this institution happens to be composed of only 1/3 of its  members. Much less if we speak of the French speaking MP&#8217;s.</p>
<p>It is  therefore a guilty lightness which does not really surprises me, coming  from a Parliament of puppies, submitted to the dictates of political  parties. Thank you.</p>
