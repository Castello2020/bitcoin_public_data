					<p class="posted">Posted on August 25th, 2011 by Marc Stevens</p>
					
					<div class="entry">
						<p>Standing is the same wherever you go, the important elements are (1) the violation of a right, a legal injury; and (2) damage.Â  The only &#8220;authority&#8221; one should need is to look at the <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/image.htm" target="_blank">Declaration of Independence</a> for the only reason for the establishment of an American government:</p>
<p>&#8220;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. â <strong>That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted</strong> among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed&#8230;&#8221; (Emphasis mine)</p>
<p>This of course is repeated in &#8220;state&#8221; constitutions such as Arizona: &#8220;governments &#8230; are established to protect and maintain individual rights.âÂ  <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/const/2/2.htm" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arizona constitution article II Â§ 2</span></a>. This is why standing and jurisdiction must always involve a plaintiff&#8217;s rights.</p>
<p>However, statists, especially attorneys, are not interested in the plain truth.Â  That is why they claim everything I write is taken out of context.Â  An example is standing.Â  This incredibly simple issue is intentionally complicated by attorneys whose money is made arguing.Â  AttorneysÂ  will claim because I provide quotes and citations from civil cases, that standing and jurisdiction only applies to civil cases, not criminal cases.Â  One attorney in Arizona, Paula Burgess, acting as a judge, told me with a straight face article II Â§ 2 did not apply to criminal cases.Â  In Ms. Burgess&#8217;s opinion the criminal court system was either not created by the Arizona constitution or is not a part of the government.Â  It&#8217;s absurd to claim standing and jurisdiction requirements do not apply in criminal cases.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple logic and common sense, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor" target="_blank">juris doctorate</a> not required:</p>
<p>(1) the government was established/instituted for one purpose i.e., to secure/protect rights;</p>
<p>(2) the courts being a part of the government have the same singular purpose i.e., to secure/protect rights;</p>
<p>(3) the courts&#8217; jurisdiction has one purpose i.e., to secure/protect rights;</p>
<p>(4) Standing to invoke, or invoking a court&#8217;s jurisdiction requires the allegation a right has been, or is being violated.</p>
<p>Standing applies in criminal cases, even if the word itself may not be customarilyÂ  used; the underlying principal is what&#8217;s important.Â  What attorneys probably don&#8217;t like is it doesn&#8217;t require a one-hundred thousand dollar education to know and understand it; all it requires is to know what the purpose of government is <em>supposed</em> to be.Â  Maybe one of the reasons attorneys don&#8217;t like this is that it&#8217;s a threat to their monopoly.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s examine the heinous crime called the &#8220;unauthorized practice of law&#8221;, attorneys LOVE this.Â  Their passionate enforcement is evidence enough (try to assist a friend in court and watch the attorneys come alive).Â  In California it is &#8220;punishable by up to one year in a county jail or by a fine of up to one thousand dollars ($1000), or by both&#8230;&#8221; California Business and Professions <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/bpc/6125-6140.05.html" target="_blank">Code Â§ 6126(a)</a>.</p>
<p>Government has one purpose &#8220;governments &#8230; are established to protect and maintain individual rights.âÂ  <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/const/2/2.htm" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arizona constitution article II Â§ 2</span></a>.Â  Whose rights am I accused of violating if I am accused of the &#8220;unauthorized practice of law&#8221; crime?Â  If you have trouble identifying whose rights to life, liberty or property are violated, then don&#8217;t despair because it violates no one&#8217;s rights.Â  It&#8217;s the same if I am growing marijuana on my property, it violates no one&#8217;s rights and injures no one.Â  I wonder how many attorneys would be out of work if the &#8220;drug war&#8221; ended tomorrow?Â  Looks like a motive to me.</p>
<p>Remember, attorneys are part of the system, their <a href="index.php?/content/view/23/27/">allegiance</a> is to that system because that system is where and how they get such high profits.Â  <em>Anything</em> that would take away fom their profits will be attacked.Â  Therefore, anything that would take business away from the courts will be opposed by this aggression-drunk <a href="index.php?/content/view/23/27/">cult</a>.</p>
<p>As designed by this cult, there will always be conflicting &#8220;precedents&#8221; and there are probably &#8220;opinions&#8221; out there that may appear to conflict, or actually conflict with, the cases I provide below.Â  Do not let that discourage you, remember the cases I have cited are consistent with constitutions, enabling acts and the Declaration of Independence.Â  When conflicting &#8220;opinions&#8221; are brought forth, then take that as evidence that attorneys will say anything.Â  It&#8217;s one more reason not to give any credibility to an attorney.</p>
<p>This cross-reference is a work in progress, so please check back often for updates.Â  I will have each &#8220;state&#8221; standing &#8220;authority&#8221; posted.Â  And remember, I, Marc Stevens, am not an attorney, so everything is for entertainment purposes only and if anything here resembles the truth, then it must have been taken out of context.</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Distinctions between crime and tort</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>While the same act may constitute both a crime and a tort, the distinction between crimes and torts is based on the public nature of the criminal offense.</p>
<p>The distinction with respect to the character of the rights affected and the nature of the wrong is this: Â A tort is merely a private wrong in that it is an infringement of the civil rights of individuals, considered merely as individuals, while a crime is a public wrong in that it affects public rights and is an injury to the whole community, considered as a community in it&#8217;s social aggregate capacity.</p>
<p>The distinction between a tort and a crime lies in the difference between the methods by which the remedy for the wrong is pursued; a wrong for which the remedy is pursued by, and at the discretion of, the individual injured or his representative is a tort, and a wrong for which the wrongdoer is proceeded against by the sovereign or state for the purpose of punishment is a crime.&#8221; Â <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Corpus Juris Secundum</span>, Vol 22, page 26 (2006 ed).

The degree and manner of evidence that is required to establish standing varies as the successive of any litigation proceeds.Â  At the pleading stage, general allegations of injury are sufficient to withstand a motion to dismissâ¦When a motion for summary judgment is filed however, the plaintiff can no longer rest on such âmere allegations.â â¦ The term âstandingâ refers to the right of a party to invoke the jurisdiction of a court to enforce a claim or to redress a grievance.Â  Standing is a threshold question that must be answered by a court affirmatively to ensure that the litigation before the tribunal is a âcase or controversyâ that is appropriate for the exercise of the courtâs judicial powers.Â  The issue of standing is concerned âonly with the question of who is entitled to mount a legal challenge and not with the merits of the subject matter in controversy.âÂ  To establish standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate first, that he or she sustained an âinjury-in-factâ; and second, that the interests he or she seeks to be protected are within the zone of interests to be protected.âÂ  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dover Hist.

<p>&#8220;Standing to sue is critical to the proper functioning of the judicial system. â It is a threshold issue. â If standing is denied, the pathway to the courthouse is blocked. â The plaintiff who has standing, however, may cross the threshold and seek judicial redress. It is difficult to draw an exquisitely sharp line separating the worthy litigant from one who would generate a lawsuit to advance someone else&#8217;s cause. â The rules governing standing help courts separate the tangible from the abstract or speculative injury, and the genuinely aggrieved from the judicial dilettante or amorphous claimant.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8220;<em>corpus delecti</em> consists of the occurrence of a loss or injury resulting from some person&#8217;s criminal conduct.&#8221;Â  <em>Commonwealth v.

<p>&#8220;It has long been fundamental to the criminal jurisprudence of this Commonwealth that a necessary predicate to any conviction if proof of the corpus delecti, i.e., the occurrence of any injury or loss and someone&#8217;s criminality as the source of this injury or loss.Â  See Commonwealth v. Burns, 490 Pa. 619, 627, 187 A.2d 552, 556-557 (1963); Commonwealth v. Turza, 340 Pa. 128, 133, 16 A.2d 401, 404 (1940).&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Commonwealth v.

<p>âThe two elements of âcorpus delectiâ are that loss or injury has occurred and that loss or injury occurred through criminal agency; identity of party responsible for act is not element of corpus delecti.âÂ  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Com. v.

<p>&#8220;It is a well-settled principal of law that a crime is an offense against the sovereignty, a wrong which the government deems injurious not only to the victim but to the public at large, and which it punishes through a judicial proceeding in the Commonwealth&#8217;s name.Â  21 Am.Jur.2d 61, pp. 115-116.Â  Though the same wrongful act may consititute both a crime and a tort, the tort is a private injury which is to be pursued by the injured party.Â  <em>Id</em>., at [section] 2, p. 116.Â  Criminal prosecutions are not to settle private grievances but are to rectify the injury done to the Commonwealth.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Com. v.

<p><strong>Texas</strong>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Wigmore explains the American concept of the <em>corpus delecti</em> rule thus:</p>
<p>[Every crime] reveals three component parts, <em>first</em>, the <em>occurrence</em>Â  of the specific kind of injury or loss (as in homicide, a person deceased; in arson, a house burnt; in larceny, property missing); <em>secondly</em>, somebody&#8217;s criminality (in contrast, e.g., to accident) as theÂ source of the loss,&#8211;these two together involving the commission of a crime by <em>somebody</em>; and <em>thirdly</em>, the accused&#8217;s <em>identity</em> as the doer of the crime.</p>
<p>In most American jurisdictions, including Texas, the <em>corpus delecti</em> rules requires some corroboration of the first two elements-an injury or loss and a criminal agent&#8230;&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Salazar v. State</span>, 86 S.W.3d 640,Â 645.</p>

<p>âIt is axiomatic that standing is the first prerequisite to maintaining a suit.Â  <em>Hunt v. Bass</em>, 664 S.W.2d 323, 324â¦Persons have standing to sue if they can show that (1) they have sustained some direct injury as a result of a wrongful act; (2) there is a direct relationship between their alleged injury and the claim sought to be adjudicated; (3) they have a personal stake in the controversy; (4) the challenged action as caused them an injury in fact, whether economic or otherwiseâ¦Because standing is a jurisdictional requirement, it may be addressed for the first time on appeal.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sierra Club v.

<p>âThe requirement in this State that a plaintiff have standing to assert a claim derives from the Texas Constitutionâs separation of powers among the departments of government, which denies the judiciary authority to decide issues in the abstract, and from the Open Courts provision, which provides court access only to a âperson for an injury done himâ. A court has no jurisdiction over a claim made by a plaintiff without standing to assert it.Â  For standing, a plaintiff must be personally aggrieved; his alleged injury must be concrete and particularized, actual or imminent, not hypothetical.Â  A plaintiff does not lack standing simply because he cannot prevail on the merits of his claim; he lacks standing because his claim of injury is too slight for a court to afford redress.â Â  <a href="http://74.125.155.132/search?q=cache%3AFocry0ubqkcJ%3Acaselaw.findlaw.com%2Fdata2%2Ftexasstatecases%2Fsc%2F031189.pdf+standing+cause+action+texas+supreme+court&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Daimler Chrysler Corporation, v.

<p>&#8220;Generally,Â  &#8220;&#8216;[t]o establish guilt&#8217; &#8221; in a criminal case, &#8220;the prosecution [must] show that [1] the injury or harm specified in the crime occurred, [2] this injury or harm was caused by someone&#8217;s criminal activity, and [3] the defendant was the [perpetrator].&#8217; &#8221; <em>State v. Talbot</em>, 665 P.2d 1274, 1276 (Utah 1983) (citation omitted).Â  The corpus delecti, or body of the crime, involves only the first two elements, however.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">State v. Mauchley</span>, 67 P.3d 477, 482 (Utah 2003).</p>
<p>â&#8221;Corpus delecti ruleâ states that person may not be convicted of crime if no independent evidence, outside defendantâs own statement, exists; to satisfy doctrine, state must produce independent evidence that injury or harm specified in crime occurred and that injury or harm was caused by someoneâs criminal activity.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">State v. Archuleta</span>, 850 P.2d 1232, 1241.</p>
<p>âMr. Justice Cooley, in Post v. Campau, 42 Mich. 96, 3 N.W. 272, said: âThe elements of a cause of action are, first, a breach of duty owing by one person to another; and second, a damage resulting to the other from the breach.âÂ  In Foot v. Edwards, 3 Blatchf. 313, Fed. Cas. No. 4,908, Mr. Justice Ingersoll said: âThe commission of an act by the defendant, and damage to the plaintiff in consequence thereof, must unite, to give a good cause of action.Â  No one of these facts by itself is a cause of action against the defendant.âÂ  In City of North Vernon v. Vogler, 103 Ind. 319, 2 N.E. 821, it is said: âIn every valid cause of action two elements must be present-the injury and the damage.Â  The one is the legal wrong which is to be redressed; the other, the scale or measure of the recovery.âÂ  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fields v. Daisy Gold Min. Co</span>., 73 P. 521, 522, 26 Utah, 373.</p>
<p>âAn issue is âripeâ for adjudication only when it has sharpened into an actual or imminent clash of legal rights.âÂ  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pett v. Autoliv ASP, Inc</span>., 106 P.3d 705.</p>
<p>&#8220;In general, standing is available only to a person who has sustained some injury to her personal, legal, or property rights.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In re E.H</span>., 137 P.3d 809, 819.</p>
<p>&#8220;To satisfy the &#8220;basic requirements&#8221; of the traditional standing test, &#8220;a party must alleged that he or she has suffered or will immediately suffer an injury that is fairly traceable to the conduct at issue such that a favorable decision is likely to redress the injury.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chen v. Stewart</span>, 123 P.3d 416, 437 (Utah 2005).</p>
<p>&#8220;In orderÂ  to have standing, a plaintiff must be able to show that he has suffered some distinct and polpable injury that gives him a personal stake in the outcome of the legal dispute.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Council of Holliday City v. Larkin</span>, 89 P.3d 164.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under principals of standing, a party may generally assert only his or her own legal rights, and cannot raise the claims of third parties who are not before the court.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Provo City Corp. v. Thompson</span>, 86 P.3d 735.</p>
<p>&#8220;The requirement that a plaintiff demonstrate particularized injury is the traditional test for standing.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Washington County Water Conservancy Dist. v. Morgan</span>, 82 P.3d 1125.</p>
<p><strong>Vermont</strong>:</p>
<p>âcourts must look behind names that symbolize the parties to determine whether a justiciable case or controversy is presented.âÂ  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">State v. CNA Ins.

<p>âWe examined, accordingly, the substance of the plaintiffâs constitutional and civil rights claims, concluding that they implicated no legally protected right under the constitution.Â  We affirmed, therefore, the trial courtâs dismissal both on lack of standing and on the merits.âÂ  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Daye v. State</span>, 769 A.2d 630, 633 (Vt. 2000).</p>
<p>âTo satisfy the standing requirement, a plaintiff must show (1) injury-in-fact, (2) causation, and (3) redressibility; thus, the plaintiff must allege a personal injury traceable to the defendantâs conduct that the court can remedyâ¦âÂ  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brigham v. State</span>, 889 A.2d 715.</p>
<p>âThe main standing requirement is that the plaintiff show threat of injury to a protected interest.âÂ  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blum v. Friedman</span>, 782 A.2d 1204, 1207.</p>
<p>&#8220;the phrase &#8220;judicial power&#8221; implies the construction of laws and the adjudication of legal rights.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gould v. Parker</span>, 42 A.2d 416, 418.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia</strong>:</p>
<p>&#8220;But basic concepts of our criminal jurispridence cannot be treated lightly in a zealous, and albeit a commendable, desire to reduce crime and convict culpits.Â  Among these safeguards is the requirement that the State must establish the existence of the <em>corpus delecti</em>Â and prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt by admissible evidence.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pepoon v. Commonwealth</span>, 66 S.E.2d 854, 859.</p>
<p>&#8220;Point of standing is to ensure that person who asserts a position has substantial legal right to do so and that his rights will be affected by disposition of the case.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cupp v. Board of Supr&#8217;s of Fairfax County</span>, 318 S.E.2d 407.</p>
<p>&#8220;The purpose of requiring standing is to make certain that a party who asserts a particular position has the legal right to do so and that his rights will be affected by the disposition of the case.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Goldman v. Landslide</span>, 552 S.E.2d 67, 71 (Va. 2001).</p>
<p><strong>Washington</strong>:</p>
<p>âAll political power is inherent in the people, and governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and are established to protect and maintain individual rights.â <a href="http://www.courts.wa.gov/education/constitution/index.cfm?fa=education_constitution.display&amp;displayid=Article-01" target="_blank">Washington constitution article I Â§ 1</a>.</p>
<p>âCorpus delecti is usually proven by following two elements: injury or loss, and someoneâs criminal act as cause thereofâ¦âÂ  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">State v. Smith</span>, 801 P.2d 975, 115 Wash.2d 775.</p>
<p>ââCorpus delectiâ consists of injury or loss and someoneâs criminal act which caused it.âÂ  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">State v. Espinoza</span>, 774 P.2d 1177, 1182, 112 Wash.2d 819.</p>
<p>âCorpus delecti usually consists of two elements: (1) Â an injury or loss&#8230; and (2)somone&#8217;s criminal act as the cause thereof.âÂ  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">City of Bremerton v. Corbett</span>, 773 P.2d 1135, 138,Â 106 Wash.2d 569.<br />
&#8220;In order to establish the <em>corpus delecti</em> of any crime there must be shown to have existed a certain act or result forming the basis of the criminal charge and the existence of a criminal agency as the cause of such act or result.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">State v. Goranson</span>, 408 P.2d 7, 9, [quoting State v. Meyer, 37 Wash.2d 759, 763, 226 P.2d 204 (1951)].</p>
<p>&#8220;The term corpus delecti means the body of the crime, or, to state it differently, that the crime charged has actually been committed by some one.Â  It is made up of two elements: first, that a certain result has been produced, as that a human being has died; and second, that some one is criminally responsible for the result.Â  State v. Henderson, Or., 184 P.2d 392.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">State v. Jeannet</span>, 192 P.2d 983, 984.</p>

<p>&#8220;Injury in fact element of standing is satisfied when a plaintiff alleged the challenged action will cause a specific and personal harm.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kucera v. State, Dept. of Transp</span>., 995 P.2d 63.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctrine of standing prohibits the litigant from raising another&#8217;s legal rights.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Haberman v. Washington Public Power Supply System</span>, 744 P.2d 1032.</p>
<p><strong>Washington DC</strong>:</p>
<p>âIt is an elementary matter of jurisprudence that an individual must have standing in order to maintain an action.Â  Basic to standing is the requirement that the individual be injured in fact by the conduct of the other party.Â  See, e.g., <em>Lee v. District of Columbia Board of Appeals and Review</em>, 423 A.2d 210 (D.C. 1980).Â  We find no injury to Burleson flowing from Unitedâs conduct.Â  Burelson is without standing to maintain his action against United.âÂ  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Burelson v. United Title &amp; Escrow Co. Inc</span>., 484 A.2d 535, 537.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia</strong>:</p>
<p>âIt is well-recognized, and we now so hold, that [s]tandingâ¦is comprised of threeÂ  elements; first, the partyâ¦[attempting to establish standing] must have suffered an âinjury-in-factâ â an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent and not conjectural or hypothetical.Â  Second, there must be a causal connection [between] the injury and the conduct forming the basis of the suit.Â  Third, it must be likely that the injury will be redressed through a favorable decision of the court.âÂ  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Findley v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co</span>., 576 S.E.2d 807,821.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;Generally, standing is defined as &#8216;[a] party&#8217;s right to make a legal claim or seek judicial enforcement of a duty or right.&#8221;&#8221; <em>Findley v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co</em>.,Â  213 W.Va. 80, 94, 576 S.E.2d 807,821 (2002)&#8230;One aspect of standing is that one generally lacks standing to assert the rights of another.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">State ex rel. Lueng v. Sanders</span>, 584 S.E.2d 203, 212 (W.Va. 2003).</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin</strong>:</p>
<p>âAll men are born equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights; among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit ofÂ  happiness; toÂ  secure theseÂ  rights, governments are institutedÂ  among men,Â  deriving theirÂ  just powers from the consent of the governed.âÂ  <a href="http://www.harbornet.com/rights/wisconsi.txt" target="_blank">Wisconsin constitution article I Â§ 1</a> .</p>
<p>While the corpus delecti must be proved beyond all reasonable doubt, yet it may be established by circumstantial as well as direct evidence.Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Schwantes v. State</span>, 106 N.W. 237, 127 Wis. 169.</p>
<p>âLaw of standing is to be construed liberally; where an actual injury is demonstrated, even a trifling interest may be sufficient to confer standing.âÂ  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club v. Wisconsin Dept. of Health and Social Services</span>, 387 N.W.2d 245.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisconsin employs a two-step standing analysis.Â  The analysis requries the court to determine (1) whether the plaintiff has suffered a threatened or actual injury, and (2) whether the interest asserted is recognized by law.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Schwittay v. Sheboygan Falls Mut. Ins. Co.</span>, 630 N.W.2d 772, 776.</p>
<p><strong>Wyoming</strong>:</p>
<p>&#8220;A party has standing &#8220;only if he has a tangible and legally protectable interest at stake in the litigation; his interest must be injured or threatened with injury&#8230;&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Billings v. Wyoming Bd. of Outfitters</span>, 88 P.3d 455, 479 (Wyo. 2004).</p>
<p>âthe duty of this court, as of <strong><em>every judicial tribunal</em></strong>, is limited to <strong><em>determining rights</em></strong> of persons or of property, which are actually controverted in the particular case before it.âÂ  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tyler v.

<p><strong>In addition to the federal cases cited above:</strong></p>
<p>âThe plaintiff must show that he himself is injured by the challenged action of the defendant.Â  The injury may be indirect, see United States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 669, 688, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 2416, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973), but the complaint must indicate that the injury is indeed fairly traceable to the defendantâs acts or omissions.Â  Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 41-42, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1925-1926, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976); OâShea v. Littelton, 414 U.S. 488, 498, 94 S.Ct. 669, 677, 38 L.Ed2d 674 (1974); Linda R. S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 617, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 1148, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973).âÂ  <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=429&amp;page=252" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vil. of Arlington Hts. v. Metro Housing Dev</span></a>., 429 U.S. 252, 262.</p>
<p>âComponent parts of every crime are the occurrence of a specific kind of injury or loss, somebodyâs criminality as source of the loss, and the accusedâs identity as the doer of the crime; the first two elements are what constitutes the concept of âcorpus delecti.âÂ  <a href="http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=19891798881F2d917_11649.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR2-1986-2006" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">U.S. v. Shunk</span>, 881 F.2d 917</a>, 919 C.A. 10 (Utah).</p>
<p>&#8220;Most American courts take the view that the phrase &#8220;<em>corpus delecti&#8221;</em> includes first, the fact of an injury or a loss and secondly, the fact of somebody&#8217;s criminality (in contrast <em>e.g.</em> to accident) as the cause of the injury or loss.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">United States. v. Echeles</span>, 222 F.2d 144, 155 (C.A. 10th Cir Ill.).</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, we share the view most American courts that theÂ phrase &#8220;<em>corpus delecti&#8221;</em>includes but two elements: first, the fact of an injury or loss; and secondly, the fact of <em>somebody&#8217;s </em>criminality as the cause of the injury or loss.&#8221;Â  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">French v. United States</span>, 232 F.2d 736 738, (C.A. 5th Cir. La.).</p>
<p>&#8220;To paraphrase one of the leading cases: &#8216;Most American courts take the view that the phrase &#8220;<em>corpus delecti&#8221;</em> includes first, the fact of an injury or a loss and secondly, the fact of somebody&#8217;s criminality (in contrast <em>e.g.</em> to accident) as the cause of the injury or loss&#8230;&#8217;Â  Manning v.

âIt is to be regarded rather as a reminder that the jurisdiction is limited to the resolution of justiciable issues; that the only kind of rights with which the court is concerned are legal rights; and that accordingly there must be a real and present dispute between the parties as to the existence or extent of a legal rightâ</p>

<p>I did however find&#8230;.this within this case.</p>
<p>&#8220;This general rule of standing is applied in all cases absent a statutory exception to the contrary. Scott v. Board of Adjustment, 405 S.W.2d 55 (Tex.1966).  </p>
<p>Of course, the above  assumes one is obligated to follow the statutes in the first place.</p>

<p>&#8220;The requirement of standing is implicit in the Texas Constitution&#8217;s open courts provision, which contemplates access to the courts only for those litigants suffering an injury. Tex. Ass&#8217;n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 444 (Tex.1993). Standing is a prerequisite to subject-matter jurisdiction, and subject-matter jurisdiction is essential to a court&#8217;s power to decide a case. Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 553-54 (Tex. 2000). &#8220;[S]tanding focuses on the question of who may bring an action.&#8221; Patterson v. Planned Parenthood, 971 S.W.2d 439, 442 (Tex.1998).&#8221;</p>

<p>Supreme Court stuff is always a good thing for those lower court judges/magistrates to contemplate.</p>

			<p>Relating to my first post: Hunt v. Bass, 664 S.W.2d 323 </p>
<p>The quote, âIt is axiomatic that standing is the first prerequisite to maintaining a suit.â does not exist in the opinion in that particular case.  However, that quote is used in the opinion from case no:</p>
<p>12-01-00372-CV</p>
<p>POLARIS INDUSTRIES, INC. v MCDONALD &#8211;  APPEAL FROM THE 273RD</p>
<p>indicating that it does indeed exist.   So even judges misquote stuff&#8230;figures.</p>
