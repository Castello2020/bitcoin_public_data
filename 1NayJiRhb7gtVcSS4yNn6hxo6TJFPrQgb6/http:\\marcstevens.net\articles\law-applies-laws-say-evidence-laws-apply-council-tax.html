					<p class="posted">Posted on April 25th, 2014 by Marc Stevens</p>
					
					<div class="entry">
						<p>This edition of the Same ol&#8217; Lie World Tour takes us back to England.  I&#8217;m helping a couple with an attack from the people wanting what they call a &#8220;council tax&#8221;.  If the couple does not comply, then men with guns will take their property.</p>
<p>I did edit this call for names, amplify some parts and cut out about five minutes at the beginning because there was an issue finding the power of attorney.  I left the part from the beginning where the recording mentions the calls are recorded.</p>
<p>The tax agent, though she filed a summons on court, admits to relying on nothing more than: &#8220;The laws apply because the laws say so.&#8221;  No evidence, just circular logic and threats.  She even resorts to asking me if I&#8217;m qualified.  As if that has anything to do with evidence to support their argument the laws apply to everyone.</p>
<p>But when you have no facts to support your arguments, you have have to resort to diversion.  Governments, just men and women doing business at the barrel of a gun.  Of course there&#8217;s no evidence to prove their laws apply, it&#8217;s all about aggression.</p>
<p>If you disagree, and you has evidence yet another bureaucrat is unable to provide, please contact me here and call into a live broadcast of the No State Project.  And I mean facts, not insults and more circular logic.</p>

			<p>Uk council tax is a local extortion by any other means, it replaced the infamous poll tax which the people of the UK rebelled in a rare period of rebellion which got rid of a British  prime Minister her name was Margaret Thatcher and also got rid of a hated tax which was replaced by another the now hated council ripoff tax!<br />
In the audio file the woman from the council states it&#8217;s the law many times but it isn&#8217;t the law it is in fact a statue, all statues are a commercial entiprise by the corporations in demanding by menaces!<br />
In this case the ultimate threat if you don&#8217;t pay up then prison is the threat sanction/punishment!</p>
<p>There are many innocent people in prison who shouldn&#8217;t be there!</p>
<p>Time for a good Revolution I tink!?</p>

			<p>The only &#8220;qualification&#8221; relevant here is an ability to engage in rational analysis of demonstrable facts and evidence.  All else is diversionary balderdash.</p>

			<p>Wow&#8230;The impressive take away from this call is that this woman remains so cool throughout and of course she will have no idea about the questioning from marc &#8211; and why would she.  She knows that Council tax applies to persons and she knows she has jurisdiction. </p>
<p>These calls that argue about jurisdiction simply creates a controversy that requires the services of a  referee to step in and settle the matter &#8211; a job for a magistrate. Hence,  is it not true that by arguing jurisdiction actually creates a  controversial issue that requires adjudication? All the magistrate need do is determine if the defendant is a person/debtor as defined under statute in order to resolve the controversy.</p>
<p>Perhaps a more effective way is to setoff the charge privately and work with this nice woman to gain agreement that the charge is paid (Or Alternatively, not pay,  create more controversy,  argue some more and go to court as a debtor)</p>

			<p>Andrew, like so many psychopath &#8220;judges&#8221; that claim that to ask a question is to make an argument, are you also a &#8220;judge&#8221; or perhaps a persecutor or lawyer?</p>

demanding proof of Jurisdiction does not bring a controversy before the Court<br />

			<p>Andrew is closer than he thinks.  I&#8217;ve never spoken w/ him so I really don&#8217;t know how much he knows about the &#8220;person&#8221;.  There is in the preface of all statutes (sometimes called law books) books a paragraph that says very clearly to whom the statutes apply and it also says that its only prima facie.  (Spelling in out for some of you), the prima facie law only applies to a person.  And I also know that in 1861 or 1862 Congress defined person as a corporate entity (man made). Now, also being a Christian, I know that God does not deal with the dead, He leaves that for lucifer.  Anything that man can make is dead such as a &#8220;person&#8221;.  I also know that God is not a respecter of person(s).  (many scripture available upon request) So being the so-called Christian why would I want to be one?  But yet one can hear today how the media has taken the individual gender out of our lives by calling everyone a person.  EXAMPLE: spokesperson v. spokesman, chairperson v. chairman and so on.  Isn&#8217;t the word man in woman also?  And we acquiesced by repeating it and saying yes.  So now one has put man above God.  And we still claim to be Christian.  Genesis 2:7 says exactly what we are.  But now the Bible is no longer an instruction book but a book of convenience.  Now the Government knows that if we say we&#8217;re a person whether it be vocalized or on paper. We are no God fearing but man fearing and now the common sense values no longer apply, only their statutes to which to agree to be part of instead of one with Gods world.  A corp. entity is a &#8220;person&#8221; and you can see this by it&#8217;s name being in all capital letters.  If this doesn&#8217;t mean or make a difference, then why did the powers that be change all of our God given names in upper and lower case letters to all upper case?  We are fast becoming a secular country and the Christian is to be prosecuted.</p>
<p>Even the tax laws apply only to the &#8220;person&#8221;.  Who says the tax laws are only found in 26 USC.  They can be any of the 50 US codes. Check out 4 USC 105-110.  Now you know why the IRS will never answer any of the questions that any of us ask.  Because if they did, they&#8217;d have to tell us this information and then we&#8217;d know what laws (statutes) to change and the moneychangers can&#8217;t have that. </p>
<p>This newspaper has the authorization from me to give my email to whomever.  We can discuss this further and more in depth.</p>

			<p>I am confused.</p>
<p>Q: Why does the court or judge even care if the prosecutor can&#8217;t present evidence the law applies.  In this sham, they already have a gun in your face and everyone there is employed by the &#8220;state&#8221; (clerk, bailiff, deputy, prosecutor, judge, janitor, jailers).  What is it about this particular aspect (inapplicability) that would make them want to back down?</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get something straight and clear&#8221;!</p>
<p>The surname in caps is a name of a fictional person in the corporate world, that person is a fictional entity performing for all the corporations like the police/thugs/mafiosi, Courts yes and even fire services,hospitals,libraries,schools etc etc the list is endless wake up people and smell the stench of corruption and lies!<br />
The surname in Higher case is the key to unlocking big trouble that may cum ya way!<br />
Use it and enter into the world of contracts you may as well slit your throat, your wrist and hang yourself if it all could be done at the same time because that is in fact is what you are doing to yourself!? You are effectively crucifying yourself before you even realise/know it!?</p>
<p>So In a court situation don&#8217;t give a surname or answer to a surname in caps they have given you!</p>
<p>What you do is state on and for the public record that you are either the administrator and executor on behalf of the named person, or the Agent I prefer! That is the best free advice that anyone can give you coupled with the very good advice by Marc with regards to show me The empirical evidence that your rules ,regulations, statues, constitution apply to me? Provide the evidence you mother fu&#8230;s!</p>

			<p>@ bangalore, because the gun is not usually in your face, we are taking advantage of their PR about due process and justice.

			<p>@ Marc&#8230;..geez are u serious? How long have u been at this and still don&#8217;t comprehend that giving a name in court binds you to a legal entity. You keep asking for evidence &#8211; just need to listen and read. Do you ever wonder why the magistrate keeps calling you Mr Stevens? He&#8217;s gaining your agreement to be a person.</p>
<p>Here in Australia every single Statute references &#8220;Persons&#8221; and never a man or woman, same in US, UK Canada etc&#8230;</p>
<p>Quite simply being a person means you agree to be a registered legal entity that the state has authority over. This is basic 101 trust law.</p>
<p> ACTS INTERPRETATION ACT 1901 &#8211; SECT 2C<br />
References to persons</p>
<p>             (1)  In any Act, expressions used to denote persons generally (such as &#8220;person&#8221;, &#8220;party&#8221;, &#8220;someone&#8221;, &#8220;anyone&#8221;, &#8220;no-one&#8221;, &#8220;one&#8221;, &#8220;another&#8221; and &#8220;whoever&#8221;), include a body politic or corporate as well as an individual. </p>
<p>On the other hand &#8211; never mind, this is probably too difficult, ignore the above, move along nothing to see here.</p>

			<p>Although I really like the way Marc&#8217;s questions hit a nerve with the workers with illusions of grandeur I have to say that as far as i&#8217;m aware there are only 2 real forms of Law&#8230; Tort (criminal) and Civil (Contract)<br />
I believe the answer to where they get their authority is from &#8216;us&#8217; by way of contracts and you get dragged into courts of equity and found guilty when you don&#8217;t uphold your end of the contract.<br />
They wont tell anyone that because everyone would of course &#8220;not make contracts&#8221; and they would lose their advantage.<br />
One might argue that you did not consent to a contract or that you were not given full disclosure but in a court of equity they only look for 2 things, agreement (you signed) and consideration (you received a benefit)<br />
Approach the judge with that in mind and see what happens.</p>

			<p>@Dante &#8211; there is no law in the court, it must be brought in. The prosecutor will bring in the law, oh er, contract that is in controversy eg a ACT/Statute. What do you bring in? Does Marc explain which law you are to bring in? Hence, Marc will appear under their law and will agree to be the name &#8211; a registered entity &#8211; aka your birth certificate/ID etc. Jurisdiction is obtained at this point.</p>
<p>Unless you notice the court first and tell them in what capacity you will attend as (eg an Accommodation party &#8211; read the bill of exchange ACT, a Man/Woman), they will by default presume you are a person.</p>
<p>Folks, this isn&#8217;t rocket science and the public ACTs and Statutes even explain the definitions of terms.</p>
<p>The key is to resolve the issue before going to court and have a record of it &#8211; eg be in Honor v&#8217;s what most seem to be doing here &#8211; argue and complain.</p>

			<p>@dante, Ok, let&#8217;s do this one step at a time&#8230;.The Australian Act Interpretation Act (as previously posted) describes a &#8220;Person&#8221; as a corporation/individual and not a Man or Woman. What does the relevant ACT in your country describe a person as? Let&#8217;s get this bit out the way so we&#8217;re all on the same page please.</p>

			<p>If one could obtain a copy of their original birth certificate (not the all cap green birth certificate they now give in place of your original which have the footprint on it) they could sue the state or whomever for I.D., drivers lic., state I.D. or any corp. body that prints your name that is in upper and lower as it proves your name is not in all upper but lower case as well just as your mom and God gave you.</p>

			<p>NonE, why must you be an idiot.  This is serious stuff and I do this so that others can learn.  If you want to be funny that&#8217;s okay but go to clown school and not here. I suppose in this material word, your right. But it was because of God they were able to give you the name.  Anyway, you may not believe this but the bad guys in government believe you and all atheists believe in God anyway and put all an cap birth certificate in place of the original that was filed originally.  Check it out by applying for a birth certificate today.  Your original as well as everyone else is filed in the treasury building in New York for the feds to borrow one million dollars against it from the federal reserve.  Your income tax is how the United States pays back the loan against your name to the Fed. reserve.  This is not new information but it is solid information. Again, try to obtain a copy of your original.  You cannot get it, you will only get the new all green and all caps birth certificate. And by accepting it in lieu of the original, you have established a new contract of whom you are.  For those who were around before 1968 you will notice your name went from upper/lower cased to all upper. You didn&#8217;t refute the findings of any of the Gov&#8217;t agencies so you acquiesced.</p>

You could not be more wrong (although I do appreciate your tone and the fact that you at least may be trying to understand where I might be coming from.)  What I am is sick and tired of violent people who pull crap out of their asses for which they have neither evidence nor logical support and who then demand that I agree with their stupid pronouncements.  These people are anti social at the least and violent psychopathic criminals at the other end of the spectrum and, by their very actions and pronouncements, do not deserve to live in the same environs as peaceable and respectful people.  And making claims of authority, such as &#8220;God&#8221; or &#8220;Government&#8221; is proof of their lying, violent, anti-social nature.  People who are unwilling to stand up and be responsible for their own actions are unworthy of any respect whatsoever.  Period.  They are scum.  </p>

			<p>I do have the documents to prove that congress and others know what is wrong.  And how they did it.  Thank you  Martin Padilla for your words.  Yes, I do have allot to share and I do this with hopes that someone will have the money and balls to make a stand to sue the federal government for NOT adhering to the US Constitution as they swore to. I cannot show you my documents for what I think is obvious reason.  But here is a guy in this link below that can tell you as he shows most of this evidence. Then sometime tomorrow or ASAP go to your recording office or wherever to get a copy of your birth certificate.  The outcome of this information could create a greater show of corruption than Benghazi.  So NonE is tired of all the crap from those who thought they knew the answer.  So what should we do?, quit?  All those guys and gals you should be proud of.  Perhaps they didn&#8217;t have all the answers they thought they had but they laid a blazing trail for lots to follow.  Not to mention how much more money the IRS and gov&#8217;t agencies have compared to the rest of us in the country.  That&#8217;s how the people your talking about lose.  Not because they&#8217;re wrong but because we allow them to cover it up and say nothing. And the tenacity and persistence is causing us all to getting closer to the truth.  Some gave their very life so you and I could get closer to the truth because of how huge this corruption is. No one knows it all. If they did they&#8217;d be sitting with God.  NonE, stop being a negative and help us get the truth out.  Otherwise, stand aside because there are others in this group who want to perpetuate.   Isn&#8217;t that the purpose of this group to begin with?  </p>

			<p>NonE, At one point (May 4th, 2014 at 1:01 pm)you answer my question as to why you don&#8217;t want others to know the truth and then on (May 4th, 2014 at 1:08 pm)you say you didn&#8217;t say that and call me a liar.  I do not lie, and am an honorable man. It appears you have the art of double speak down to a science. I do not want to run or be a part of anything like Guantanamo.  Should I still have the right to free speech, I would then believe you are a plant meant to confuse people and distract those such as I from knowing or hearing the truth.  Having said that, I will no longer speak of the rhetoric you have done to get me off track and only speak of that which is truth as it is or can be proven. Congress has been lying to us for a long time and in doing so has implemented things like this income tax on the American people. The Congressmen and Senators are not honorable people, they know the truth.  The truth is not as I see it but as they show it. They write laws saying one thing then impose devastating life sucking things like the IRS on us. without approval from its people. So when people such as I come along and attempt to show others where bad guys in Gov&#8217;t are lying or doing wrong, we&#8217;re the first to be verbally attacked.  All we can do is be a messenger and if you don&#8217;t want to investigate the information given, then thats your right.  But should someone not have the balls to stand for something, then they will fall for anything.  And that&#8217;s okay, not everyone is cut out for standing.  This would be a pretty dull world if we&#8217;re all the same.  For those who want to learn, I will tell of anything I have.  Well the people will be that much closer to righting this wrong entity.  I love this country America and deplore it&#8217;s falling to the commies by the taking of our liberties when those in office swear to uphold those laws and don&#8217;t.  </p>
<p>Incubus, I am sorry to have made light of you being an atheist.  When you asked &#8220;who is this guy God.&#8221;  (May 4th, 2014 at 10:23 am) You may not believe in God and that&#8217;s your right but I just figured everyone knows of God.  Forgive my assumption.  I must now stay on track of showing those who wish to investigate certain information to let them see for themselves how the American people are being screwed by people (not you) who don&#8217;t see how they can live without screwing their fellow Americans for self gratification.  Then create verbal attacks on those who question/oppose them.  </p>
<p>indio007,  Your right, it is the state property.  But its a document that is used in so many ways today against us. One must show it to even get a passport, or simply an I.D. from the state. Then they spent a vast sum of time, man hours, cost to change that which what already was to something else.   And even  the IRS shows within their code (Title 26 USC) how it is used to obtain/borrow US dollars (not money) from the Federal Reserve.  This statement &#8220;A birth certificate is an abstract of an application to record an EVENT.&#8221; is true again. But hows that change what they are doing with it now.</p>

<p>And once again you lie.   No where above do I say I don&#8217;t want others to know the truth.</p>
<p>Speaking of truth, other than their willingness to use violence to subdue people, can you show any evidence where those individual people who claim to be &#8220;Congress&#8221; and &#8220;the government&#8221; have any legitimate claim to act as the defacto owners of the entire population of those residing in the area &#8220;they&#8221; claim as the U.S.of A.?  </p>
<p>It would appear to me that these people are violent people with psychopathic tendencies wherein they believe that anything which they proclaim is then binding upon me &#8211; you know, like a schoolyard bully.  And when you speak reverently of &#8220;their code&#8221; and such what you appear to be doing is deifying those insane rantings, thus claiming such insane rantings to be &#8220;the truth.&#8221;   I can call myself &#8220;The Most Grandest Poobah&#8221; but doing so is no evidence of any truth, aside from the truth that I made that claim.  Having you (or 200,000,000 of your friends) support my claim of being &#8220;The Most Grandest Poobah&#8221; also does not create any truth in that claim.  I&#8217;m still just me.  </p>
<p>The fact that some people have written some things on paper does not automatically imbue these claims with truthitude.  If you back off somewhat from your own arrogance you might find more truth.</p>

			<p>Martin Padilla, Thank you. </p>
<p>NonE, Once again you&#8217;ve shown your rage for some reason to the point one cannot reason with you.  I do not lie, I do however will says things that I thought were the truth but then I&#8217;m not perfect and do make mistakes.  According to you, then because someone gets it wrong we must quite searching for informational truth and sit until one has the truth but then how does one find the truth if we don&#8217;t search and make mistakes along the way.  Like learning to walk again, fall down you get back up until you got it.  Unless you want an honest debate or education, I&#8217;ll talk no further of you.</p>
<p>In understanding what has happened to America and its people one cannot find it all in one sit down lesson or even in one year.  It&#8217;s all been set up for over a hundred years.  So its going to take some time to overturn it without going into an outright war.  In order to minimize our potential mistakes we must learn as much as possible before doing anything like a suit and we must all come of like mind. </p>
<p>May I suggest first learning the meaning of Prima Facie:  (Blacks law 6th ed.) A fact presumed to be true unless disproved by some evidence to the contrary.  i.e.  If Martin is wearing a white shirt into my courtroom (if I was a judge) and I would make the statement NO RED SHIRTS IN MY COURTROOM and that includes you Martin.  You would say something to the effect that you don&#8217;t have a red shirt on.  Well,&#8230;I&#8217;m the judge and its my courtroom and I say it&#8217;s red.  You Martin would then have to prove it not red.  Saying its not red does not prove it.  If we were all truly as Christian as we like to think we are then you would know how.  Deut. 19:15  &#8230;in the mouth of two witness&#8217;s or three witnesses the matter shall be established. This is from where our used to be Justice of Peace would operate from.  Have you noticed they are gone?  They were replaced by the states Notary.<br />
I AM TRYING TO KEEP THIS SHORT BUT GIVING ENOUGH TO GET THE POINT ACROSS. </p>
<p>In 1862 the sitting congress defined the word &#8220;person&#8221; to mean a Corp entity.  Now if one can remember in days of roman history the man/woman holding a mask on a stick in front of their face to reflect to the audience of being someone they were not.  &#8220;They were called a person&#8221;.  They reflected to be someone other than the God made creature they were.  Now you know why congress did what they did in 1862 and it made sense.  </p>
<p>Now if one knows anything of scripture they know that God does not deal with the dead but only the living.  So anything the state makes in dead and not a living entity. Only God can create life.  So the people were conned into over the next century to not make a business for themselves unless they had a license.  Well now its almost 100% that anyone in business has asked the state for a right to do that which was given them by God in the first place.  As we move along in the years we have lost faith in God in many ways.  I&#8217;m getting of track just a bit, back on. Birth Certificates (hereafter referred to as BC) were only established in 1878 and it was to give permission for a black to marry a white.  Then in 1921 an act called something like the Marriage, divorce, and corporation act was made. All who got married with permission from the state then become a little corporation under the big corporation called UNITED STATES and United States which used to be called District of Columbia until 1871.  But throughout the years since BC were made more and more people wanted one just as they did the marriage certificate.  I do not officiate marriage ceremonies for people with the permission of the state.  They are married under the guise of God.    And guess what, they still reap the same benefits.   The BC becoming more and more started to change in 1968 from the upper and lower case lettering on the names with a footprint and all to an all upper case and no footprint on green paper.  I can&#8217;t prove the green paper was to represent money but the original BC now goes to New York city in a vault to be used as collateral the the Treasury Dept. for the united state of America when they want to borrow money from the fed reserve, a private corporation.  This established the income tax on all.  Because they said it was our american duty to pay this tax, all who opposed it were mostly jailed.  </p>
<p>If one looks at any law book in any state they would see that they are not called law books, but statutes. In the preface of each and every book you will read something to effect that this book only established Prima Facie.  And all so-called laws (really statues) only pertain to persons not people.   We as a people were not vigilant enough to keep the ones we sent to DC honest and principled. And allowed perverts and theifs to act in our behalf.  </p>
<p>Look at any corporation or business in your town and you will see they are all in capital letters&#8230;just as you now are.  For those old enough you will remember any form of ID you had was in upper and lower case but now you will see you are in all upper.  If one could obtain a copy of the original BC the mother signs off on, they could sue to have themselves brought back under God rather than the state.  </p>
<p>Scripture says where two or more are gathered in His name is called a church.  So why does the clergy of each church now have to obtain a 501 (c)(3) tax exemption?  Because the clergy did not have the faith in God they claimed to have.  The IRS has no rules for a church but because of a man named LBJ as a young senator in 1952 introducing the 501 status which was intended for organizations such as Salvation army and Goodwill and so on.  They also talked these clergy into thinking they needed it also to prevent themselves from ever being sued.  This church is now no longer a church but an organization created by the state and the clergy fell for it.  They will tell you the truth if you ask the right question.  But now comes KJV Hosea 4:16 into play. Not to mention the state now having the ability and the right by contract to tell the s0-called churches what they can/cannot  preach.  I have the list of 29 things they must abide by. (upon request) No one rebutted being the person so now they acquiesced.  The US Constitution was written for Washington DC instructing them what they can/cannot do but since there is a majority of non-christian they reprinted the constitution to read as the US Constitution of the UNITED STATES instead of the US Constitution for the united states.  </p>
<p>This may appear to be semantics but in law they are exact and is not semantics.  i.e. you were taught in school the capitalize the name of a person, place, or thing.  Would you capitalize the word smoggy in the title Smoggy Los Angeles?  Of course not, then why are you capitalizing the word united states when their adjectives?  </p>
<p>Must go now, please ponder this information. It&#8217;s all provable. No, not my opinion&#8230; but fact.</p>

I post over at <a href="http://www.suijurisforum.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.suijurisforum.com</a>.</p>
<p>The birth certificate has a checkered history. It was created as inventory control for slaves and indentured servants with special thanks to the East India Trading Company.</p>
<p>The current secular State is simply a replacement for the church and their ecclesiastical courts. Recording a birth in a bible is essentially the same thing as recording a birth with the State.</p>
<p>Just to prove my point about ownership of children and the BC&#8217;s relation to all that.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, what information os on a BC.</p>
<p>It says a bastard was born in a hospital. It&#8217;s says it&#8217;s parents are subject/citizens/slaves</p>
<p>hospital (n.) Look up hospital at Dictionary.com<br />
mid-13c., &#8220;shelter for the needy,&#8221; from Old French hospital</p>
<p>Check out the Poor Laws of England.</p>
<p>Check out Parens Patriae, which is the &#8220;legal&#8221; basis for the State to steal children.</p>
<p>If you can get a hold of one of these Corpus Juris Secondum or American Jurisprudence the section on Parent &amp; Child.</p>
<p>It explicitly says a child custody proceeding is a determination of status (of the parents) AND a proceeding IN REM over the child.</p>
<p>Ownership of the child is presumed via the BC.</p>
<p>There was a Dr. Phil episode in which they had a child without a BC that grew up in foster care.<br />
They interviewed the head of DCF. She specifically stated that the child should have never been let into the system without a BC.</p>

			<p>Yeah, my previous note was a little long but its all provable and the truth. </p>
<p>It appears your saying the samething as I on most.  On the church thing I believe you almost have it.  Recording of a BC in the bible used to be the same thing, but as time went by it become less accepted.  If one is not a person as defined by congress and have accepted no adhesion contracts (voter ID. Drivers Lic., Passport, and etc.etc.) then yes it will still be accepted by one cannot be of both worlds.  Try to get a copy of your original BC then sue the bastards for taking you our of context and not allowing you to travel unless you have their lic. to do so. Then send a FOIA and a Privacy Act request to the US Department of the Treasury and ask for a copy of your original.   JUST TRY IT.  A God fearing man does not get married under the okay of the state.  Although we&#8217;ve been made to think we need to.  </p>
<p>Why do or did they have to replace the church with the state?  To get one to be a citizen, individual, resident, person, and taxpayer  which are all synonymous with slave.  A church doesn&#8217;t need the state permission to exist&#8230;unless you have a 501 (C)(3) exemption.  Within the 1st amendment is says &#8230;or the free exercise thereof.  But if its an organization and not a church then they can tell the clergy not to speak of a homosexual being an abomination as it says in scripture.  As well, it can tell the clergy to speak of paying the income tax as your duty.  The gov&#8217;t has had stock in vaseline for at least a hundred years.  We must continue to fight even with the number of times they knock us down.</p>

<p>Yes, it is true the attorney&#8217;s first obligation is to the court.  </p>
<p>I have gone to court several times on traffic, insurance, house foreclosure and all cases (7 total) were dismissed.  They have no law as I previously discussed, only statutes.  God&#8217;s Ten Commandment are law. As all statutes we have today called law are based on one of the Ten Commandments.  ALL LAW.  Of course one must have a non-copyrighted Bible in their possession.  I have one.  Because if its copyrighted then your cheating someone out of their fruits.  Ahh, Another day.  gotta go now.</p>

			<p>It has been a interesting process of making the first comment on this matter and then to sit back and watch and see the varied opinions and various arguments some constructive and some negative to the point of being somewhat like being in a kindergarten? Come on friends it&#8217;s time to progress into serious adult hood and work together in a harmonious constructive fashion to kill the system once and for all and only by working together can we achieve so much by joining forces in a collective,constructive,positive direction?</p>
<p>A while ago after years and years of research and learning and re-educating have I finally succeeded in susing it all out and it doesn&#8217;t come down to one simple element of evidence although it is one of the joint key elements, it comes down to 4 essential elements the key to unlocking all this skulduggery,corruption and lies that we have allowed ourselves to be deceived by the elite,illuminati the system the corporations!</p>
<p>And so you ask what are those elements well I&#8217;m going to tell you and it&#8217;s free I figured it all out that I believe that by working together with the knowledge for power is knowledge and knowledge is power and through the fountains of wisdom that we accumulate do we ensure to understand  from the truths that we shall conquer over this monstrosity on the world which has surrounded us by such an evil system that would wish to bring us harm,injury,loss to us the free human The Man/Woman of this great planet !?</p>
<p>And so to the four key elements of all this is&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.)</p>
<p>1. Name.   2. Jurisdiction. 3. Evidence. 4. Contracts.</p>
<p>Only by joining all four can you have a hope to avoid even having to go to court in the first place-instance!</p>
<p>Ultimately succeeding by beating the system and ending it&#8217;s game. it is in effect the checkmate!</p>
<p>I am willing as a sacrifice to throw down the gauntlet to Marc and others with knowledge with the knowledge to share together in a united bond of free sovereigns in a group so powerful with knowledge that we can by grouping together in blowing this system this corrupt system by the psycho&#8217;s and nutters to kingdom come,once and for all!?<br />
In show trials,and gathering the evidence to show the world!</p>

I think that is sick and if he attempts at all to manifest those beliefs then it is also violent.  It is none of my business what others think and what they do to make their lives work for them as long as they do not impinge upon the free choices of others.  There is a big difference between attempting to show others what you think may be of value and defining other peoples lives for them.  &#8211; NonE</p>

			<p>Wake up and open your eyes and ears people&#8217;s!?</p>
<p>The standard approach of the private Bar guild to jurisdiction</p>
<p>In most private courts of the private guild of the Bar, establishing personal, territorial and subject-matter jurisdiction is relatively simple and fast so that in a few moments the court has perfected its jurisdiction simply by confirming the “name” of the accused, their “residence” and that they “understand” the charges against them.</p>
<p>In perfecting “personal” jurisdiction, the so called judge simply asks if you are (some name)? If you answer yes then you have established personal jurisdiction by virtue of the fact that the 1st Cestui Que Vie Trust created upon your birth conveyed your “name” from you to the state, with you only having equitable title. Name comes from the Latin nomen, meaning the name of a slave on a register.</p>
<p>In perfecting “territorial” jurisdiction, the so called  judge simply asks for your residential address, or the location of the “res”, the property. Once you answer any location within the boundaries of the nation-state then they have you on territorial jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Now when they say do you “understand” the charges against you, they are asking will you “stand under” the jurisdiction of the so called court to hear the matter. When you answer in the affirmative, they have perfected their jurisdiction – all in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>The Bar Guilds (Societies) are the direct descendents of the Florentine, Venetian and London Guilds of the Middle Ages that used merchant trading principles to commercialize their so-called law and personally profit from crime as demonstrated by the history of courts and their literal meaning. The Bar Guilds now control almost 100% of judicial assemblies around the world in the worst example of organized crime in the history of civilization.</p>

Because all our laws, statutes, morals, and principles are based in scripture. And the evil ones within our elected fields are gaining ground because the good refuse to come out of their box. But don’t fear any, because I read the end of the book, the good guys do win.</p>

May 7th, 2014 at 7:48 am  This is in reference to your saying I&#8217;m sick and so forth.  bruce sloane on May 6th, 2014 at 5:22 pm asked why does everything have to come down to religion. Or words to that effect.  Nobody was speaking of you or to you.  As Master Steve said but in my own words, grow up.  Every law this country has IS based on scripture.  The Bill of Rights itself is based on the Ten Commandments.  This doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m telling you how to live.  We as a people have fallen prey to the meaning of Hosea 4:6 but some as you NonE are even more.  I will pray for you this evening.  Thank you Martin Padilla for trying but&#8230;I&#8217;m not dreaming, I just realize that after knowing some scripture, how low and corrupt those evil men in the powers that be arena have gone.<br />
NonE, if I have gotten the wrong reference to which you speak of, I&#8217;m sorry and please let me know the correct reference.</p>

			<p>NonE</p>
<p>The best that one can offer is to point you in the right direction were you can make an informed choice of your own by reading and researching in your own way and then makeing or concluding a decision,opinion based on the facts before you!</p>
<p>I refer you to your own birth certificate as evidence!</p>
<p> Try and obtain your original?</p>
<p>I throw this open to anyone!?</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t be done simply because the facts don&#8217;t allow you to have it, you have a copy a very good reason that when you are a human being before the age of seven when you came into this world your parents informed on you unknowingly by registering you to the state/system , this meant that you as a free spirit/human being were given the name of the Master title until the age of 16 when it was taken away from you and substituted for Mr as such !? ( do your own research with regards to the definition of Mr the lowest of the lowest of title or role and Master you will see a great difference)<br />
1. After seven years and the failure of your parents to unregistere you, then at that point you became a fictional person and your birth certificate was then promoted as a bond on the bond market as a dead person in their world/system , whereupon it has been sold and resold since that time ,you are now a commodity owned by whoever?  Don&#8217;t take my word for it look on your birth certificate and you will see the word informed more than likely? You should begin to understand that whenever you are Registering anything within the system you are handing over ownership ,You should begin to understand this then you will understand the complexities of the corporate world , commerce ,trading ,contracts and consent! So who owns you now? And can you obtain your original certificate/bond? Until you do then you are owned by someone other than you! Have you ever wondered why certain things relate to Admiralty so-called law the law of the Sea like your Birth Cirtificate , your mothers Birth Canal, Dock  in the court setting all sea related words etc etc &#8230;? You Birth a boat , boats /ships are held in a dock!? There is more but you do the research? That&#8217;s another subject matter&#8230;&#8230;..</p>

			<p>There is no birth certificate/ bond . That is pure fantasy without a shred of evidence. it sure sounds good though.</p>
<p>The true birth record is the hospital souvenir with the foot prints of the baby.</p>
<p>I do agree with you confession of residence &#8220;within&#8221; some State is evidence of &#8220;minimum sufficient contacts&#8221; as they like to call it.</p>
<p>Most people don&#8217;t know that resident means that you intend to make the place your abode FOREVER.</p>
<p>As far as the name being evidence.<br />
I would say yes , preliminary.<br />
However when  it comes to trial there needs to be a witness to identify the corpus if there is an express denial of being the man or woman that committed the acts at issue.</p>

			<p>I have been heard/read so many times that the &#8220;FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE UNITED STATES&#8221; is in THE PEOPLE. Then I read Article IV Section 1 of the United States Constitution, known as the &#8220;FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE&#8221;, and they mention of the laws and credit within the States. I now have a question, which I do not know the answer.,, who is THE PEOPLE? us? Them? The government? Government workers? Our government laws seems to me like a Chess game in which We the real people have to watch every move or they will trap us and &#8220;kill&#8221; all our defenses and win the game every time we &#8220;play&#8221; with them. So probably the best choice will be not to &#8220;play &#8221; with them because when We got a chance to Win one single little &#8221; game &#8221; they change the rules so they can always Win all the time.</p>

<p>For the most part I agree. Though I would put &#8220;win&#8221; in quotes. Truth be told, they&#8217;re losers because of their anti-social/criminal/fraudulent behavior they harm their integrity and obliterate their innocence; that&#8217;s not a win. As for their victims, there is no chance to win when they attack; there is damage control, but not a win.</p>
<p>When they stop initiating violence we both win. Preceding that, when their alleged legitimacy losses the enemy outpost in people&#8217;s minds their house of cards will collapse, seemingly overnight &#8212; so to speak.</p>

<p>Have you ever been in a courtroom during a ongoing case?  Whether you have or not,  you should experience it.  You will hear the prosecutor tell the judge something to the effect &#8230;the people move to &#8230;.  The people they&#8217;re speaking of is the legislative body, the lawmakers.   Though we (you/I) are are people as scripture reads, in todays world the people is the legislative body of each state and it was them that presented the US Constitution to the District of Columbia at the time with instruction on how to govern the individual  states.</p>

			<p>Andy,<br />
You asked for someone to identify God with empirical/factual evidence.  So I&#8217;m thinking the bible, which is not A book, but many books in one binding; and is a historical record of witnesses with first hand personal knowledge which they record separately (hence the many books not one book), to a very accurate degree when compared to each other, the accounts of Jesus and what he said, did, and died and then rose from the dead. (wow, that was a crazy long run on sentence&#8230;) This means several witnesses saw and at different times recorded what they saw, i.e. first hand personal knowledge.  By these records, this was not just one guy who claimed some crazy story about some other guy that was doing magic tricks, and then was killed and then came back&#8230; I&#8217;d never believe that. However, if you see that many different people recorded the same account with great detail, all separate from each other but with the same details&#8230; well&#8230; If you can&#8217;t accept a record of several peoples first hand personal knowledge as evidence then I don&#8217;t know what to say&#8230; except that it&#8217;s your right to not accept it if that is what you wish, and do as you will, as long as you&#8217;re not causing others any injury loss or harm what do I care&#8230; and I wish you all the best and God Bless you&#8230;!!!!</p>

<p>Yes, they have twisted the word.  Even the word may, remember when it meant you might do something?  Now it means shall and shall means may.  If you could afford it, I would suggest getting a Blacks Law 6th Ed.  It teach,es allot.</p>

			<p>Question for Marc?</p>
<p>How can anybody go into their show venue, arena, place of business, so-called court and be arrested for asking a simple question in a calm and collective way ” I demand evidence of jurisdiction!?” absolute silence! Second follow up question ” I demand evidence that the Constitution,rules and regulations, jurisdiction apply to me!? The So called judge response ” arrest this person “!?<br />
When questioning the thug/ ya know the Guy in the fancy Dress P officer? On what grounds are you intending to arrest me? ” for a breach of the peace!” Comes the reply!?<br />
BOTP Defined as to cause harm or intend to bring harm! There was clearly no harm to bear and as such was an unlawful act! The System is Mental by these psychopaths! It’s obvious Marc they don’t want to answer the relevant question and resort to violence, abduction and lock you up for 12 hrs for asking a simple Question!?</p>
<p>The lesson is there is something in the question then of evidence!?</p>
<p>My next question is what is evidence? Define EVIDENCE Marc Please?</p>

			<p>@ master, how they do it is under the pretext of disorderly conduct, then if you say anything, then they ramp it up to resisting.  Evidence is defined as facts that are relevant to proving a certain proposition, theory, opinion.</p>

AH!  Now you are about to learn one of the reason&#8217;s Marc is known for his brilliance&#8230;  One of Marc&#8217;s primary positions is to NEVER take a stand, ALWAYS ask questions.   Therefore the meaning of any word they use is defined by them in your interaction and thus you can always go back to them and say, Oh, but back here you said that this meant that&#8230;  </p>
<p>I recognize that perhaps my post here does not specifically apply to your question when it is we who are asking for evidence, but I hope you will consider this very important part of Marc&#8217;s thinking.   </p>
<p>So when we ask for &#8220;evidence&#8221; of this or that, should be first ask what they mean when they say &#8220;evidence?&#8221;  I don&#8217;t know.  It&#8217;s worth thinking bout.  Perhaps Marc (with his horribly large experience base dealing with these cretins) may have some thoughts on the issue.</p>

			<p>What do ya make of this??&#8230;<br />
 It is alleged just to protect myself-ish!!	Judges, Lawyers and members of the Bar have been carefully educated and indoctrinated into a system where they are completely ignorant to its real history, its function and the fact that the law is secondary to the Bar than making a profit from the commercializing of sin.<br />
The Bar Guilds (Societies) are the direct descendents of the Florentine, Venetian and London Guilds of the Middle Ages that used merchant trading principles to commercialize law and personally profit from crime as demonstrated by the history of courts and their literal meaning. The Bar Guilds now control almost 100% of judicial assemblies around the world in the worst example of organized crime in the history of civilization.</p>
<p>&#8220;So they dealing in Crime!?It&#8217;s the mafiosi in fancy dress!!?&#8221;<br />

			<p>bruce sloane, I&#8217;m sorry but I haven&#8217;t done any of this stuff in a long time, about 15 years now.  I moved from Hawaii about 12 years ago to Ohio, but I&#8217;m sure any records of me are still in Hawaii. You have my name.  The only thing I still do now is read Psalms 91 every morning from a KJV 1611 edition. (for sale on line only from Christian Book distributors)  It&#8217;s the only book (Bible) that is not copyrighted.  So they cannot tell me that God didn&#8217;t say this or that to me. Thus, my 1st amendment stands true to its form.  All that I know now is from memory.</p>

			<p>None are so blind as those who refuse to see. You know to whom this applies.  and Martin Padilla, your right and why would anyone remove or delete sections of that which was originally written? I know of at least 300 of these changes/deletions in the new testament alone.  When we as a people really practiced being Christian, we didn&#8217;t have the problems we have today.  When we as a people did practiced being Christian&#8230; we did not have those few today who refuse to see. But then again, if we didn&#8217;t have them around, how would we know what the downside is?  A non-copyrighted Bible can be gotten at Christian Book Distributors.com.  If you wish to know more, I give the host of this website permission to give you my email address.</p>

<p>1) None are so blind as those who refuse to see.</p>
<p>2) The only thing I still do now is read Psalms 91 every morning from a KJV 1611 edition. </p>
<p>3) Now can we keep this site to learning? Thank you.</p>

			<p>Reggie said, &#8220;This site has seen enough of your kind&#8221; Are you afraid that I and others may end up teaching/learning something that the bad guys in gov&#8217;t don&#8217;t want us to know about?</p>
<p>And as far a me being a man of God, you don&#8217;t know me. So your statement has no basis and is only for provoking one to being like yourself. </p>
<p>If you directed all that anger toward saying something intelligent, we as patriots might make some headway but your proof of us never being able to work together.  Say hi to George S. for me.  I&#8217;ll pray for you also.</p>

			<p>&#8220;we as patriots&#8221;  &#8211;  That word, patriot, is one of the most detestable words I can imagine.  It is an indication that some group of people consider themselves superior to &#8220;outsiders&#8221; whom they then band together to defend against.  It has nothing to do with love and respect for others who have not proven themselves some form of threat.  No, it makes the bald assumption that because you are different you are therefore something to be warred against.  Despicable word and mindset, if you ask me.</p>

			<p>I have dealt with government plants like yourself before, &#8220;Al&#8221;. Worse, I have seen the evils of those who are controlled by Lucifer, such as yourself. I have walked with the Lord for many decades now. These are good people here and I won&#8217;t let demons run amuck. I have cast out countless evil spirits in my time and don&#8217;t think I won&#8217;t do the same to you. Consider this your first warning and don&#8217;t take it lightly. You will spread your lies meant to confuse and mislead those who walk the path of truth no longer, Al. Goodbye. </p>

			<p>NonE, Are you telling me/us that there is nobody that gives a damn for their country?  Why don&#8217;t you tell me/us all by what name would you call anyone that wants to repair the damage that&#8217;s been done on this great country by the likes of George Soros and those (you two) who follow him? However you wish to define them and no matter what you call them there are those who care and I choose to call them patriots.  Call them whatever you wish.  And they are better than those whom you apparently follow.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s awful funny that on a site that&#8217;s meant to be a learning tool, the minute God is mentioned, guys like you and Reggie come out of the woodwork screaming.  I figure guys like you are paid plants of George Soros meant to confuse and create havoc amongest those who wish to teach/learn.  The proof is in the action(s) of your comments.  </p>
<p>If someone comes out with some new information, the first thought of anyone is normally is to ask is that true or can you help me research this or that.  And all you&#8217;ve two have done is bad mouth anything said rather than check it out.  You don&#8217;t know me so how can you possible substantiate anything you say.  So by speaking as you do, you are proof of what I&#8217;ve said.   </p>
<p>I will not entertain the likes of you two anymore and will respond only to those who wish to teach/learn.  </p>

			<p>Al, I find it awfully funny that on a site devoted to anarchism and focusing on empirical evidence for proof of the laws applicability, people like you come out of the woodworks with your unsubstantiated garbage trying to confuse and muddle the truth. On second thought, I don&#8217;t find it funny. I find it disgusting. You are a minion of Lucifer. Whoever this George friend of yours is I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s just another puppet for your god. And the way you take the Lord&#8217;s name in vain just goes to show what your true intentions are. I warned you once, Al. Your chances are wearing thin. I&#8217;ve cast out literally thousands of demons. You&#8217;re next.</p>

<p>There are no countries, Al. What you think are countries is a mental construct &#8212; a concept &#8212; that exists in your mind only. I ask again: when you look at a satellite image of Earth do you see anything that denotes a country? Is a satellite image of Earth actually Earth, or is it an image of Earth? (aka, The map is not the territory.) When I look at a map of Earth I see water and land but I don’t see any countries or names or labels of any kind.</p>
<p>Do you or do you not understand/comprehend the phrase, &#8220;the map is not the territory&#8221;?</p>

			<p>Andy I share your opinion, there are no STATES either, every thing that government created it is a large scale illusion, a fiction and they laws are not applicable, they only do if we let them. Last night I took my kids to watch a movie and a cop pull me over. I was real &#8221; lucky&#8221; because he gave me a &#8220;break&#8221; I was going 42 miles in a 35 mile per hour zone, I very respectfully ask him if I was hurting someone by going 7 more miles above the restricted 35 and he gave me a goofy smile. He told me to open my trunk and I stupidly did, (He was looking for &#8220;evidence&#8221; to make my life miserable)</p>

			<p>First you address me as Father In Heaven and then imply I am an evil spirit? That is the sort of confusion and blaspheme common to demonic possession. God is not evil, He can do no evil. Your implication that He is and can is proof you are not a believer and are here to corrupt and disrupt His will. Second, I am not The Father, I am His child.</p>
<p>Father God, I praise your Heavenly Kingdom, that your will be done on earth. I ask that you provide protection for the people on this site, that your wisdom shield them from those who try to deceive them with lies, and that you cast out this demon Al, for it is by your grace and through your blessings we find truth Father. Amen.</p>

<p>Pied Pipers of Babylon is a guide for beginners, not everything in it is true. It is a great place to start your studies tho!</p>
<p>A lot can be said about where a man gets his Law/Authority from.</p>
<p>The source of the law/authority the authors have in this book is a great tale in separation of church and state. It&#8217;s a great primer for beating false god followers at their own game with religious objections.</p>

			<p>Reggie, Can you see that this is addressed to you Reggie?  </p>
<p>Are you that stupid that you think I was calling you father rather than seeing that the reply was addressing you only. (It&#8217;s usually how one begins a letter)  Then you read exactly what you wrote to me except that now it has your name (Reggie) in it and you find all kinds of stuff wrong with it.  YOU WROTE IT! Talk about being hypocritical.  You are showing how you are the master of double speak. You are a provocateur with intent to disrupt and create chaos amongst God&#8217;s children for the benefit of your own ego.   God will never answer your prayer as He will not listen to heathen.   NOW, pay attention, the next paragraph is addressed to Andy, not you. </p>
<p>Andy, Yes I can see there are no boundary lines when looking at earth through a satellite.  Do you really believe that there are people who believe there are boundary lines on earth that can be seen through the satellite?  But if I were as stupid as some others are in this site, and you to not know them from Adam, you&#8230; rather than try to teach someone what you think to be right, choose to bad mouth and down play everything anyone says rather than to teach what is right.  Then that makes you as bad as those you oppose. Come down from your space station and deal with reality. Say or do something constructive as MarcSteven does.  Help others rather than whatever it is you and others like you are doing.  I also know that the majority of judges are crooks but rather address how to replace them with God fearing people, you allow yourself to be side tracked with crap of whether or not someone can see boundaries on earth through a satellite.  Tell us all how or what you would replace the judges with.  Can you answer that so that a simple stupid layman like me can comprehend? Or are you just all talk?  </p>
<p>Also, You are frustrated no more than the rest of us at what is wrong in our court systems.  Can you tell me how to corrected them?  What plans have you to set them right? </p>
<p>MarcStevens, For the guy in Hawaii that needed a motion.  I moved to Ohio a few years ago but I am from Hawaii originally and do know some people there that are good in legaleze.  Should you want/like to have their name, let me know.  I would email you directly so that others in this site won&#8217;t bad mouth them.</p>

			<p>Speaking of corrupted judges, last friday May 16, 2014. The T.V. show &#8220;INSIDE EDITION&#8221;, presented an investigation made by them. They followed &#8220;traffic judges&#8221; and they find out they speed, double park, and did numerous violations but at &#8220;work&#8221;&#8221;they sentenced people with stiff sentences. I love it when the reportes confronted them and all of them got the &#8220;perfect excuses&#8221; like us, &#8220;Oh I was running late for work, etc, etc&#8221; The reporters talked to the Chief Judge and he was really pist off and called them hypocritical. Actually they were worst than most of us in their driving, doing 85 miles in a 55, double parking in front of their buddies ( Cops) without consequences. All in all it was a great investigation, I love this type of shows.</p>

<p>Nothing. They&#8217;re psychopaths and thus there&#8217;s no need to replace the crooks/psychopaths with anything. What would you replace carjackers with?</p>

<p>There is no government &#8212; it&#8217;s just a gang of killers, thieves and liars. Get rid of government and its courts is how to correct the problem.

<p>Also, perhaps you didn&#8217;t know that Marc has a weekly radio show called: The No State Project. There are no states; there are no countries.</p>

			<p>Al, I cannot take responsibility if you do not understand how basic grammar works. Let&#8217;s take a look at the following sentence.</p>
<p>Sally said, &#8220;Tim, my best friend in the world, always knows the right thing to say to cheer me up.&#8221; What can de derive from that sentence? That Tim is Sally&#8217;s best friend or at least that Sally believes Tim to be her best friend. Here&#8217;s another example.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tim, the manager at Sears, was so courteous and helpful.&#8221; From that what can we derive? Tim is the manager at Sears, of course. </p>
<p>Al wrote, &#8220;Reggie, Father In Heaven, I thank you and lift your name&#8230;&#8221; What can one denote from that sentence? That you are addressing me as, Father In Heaven. Then later you write, &#8220;I call on you that you cast this evil spirit (Reggie) from this wonderful site&#8230;&#8221;, implying that I am an evil spirit. So you addressed me as, Father In Heaven, and then implied I am evil. As you can see there is no hypocrisy involved. Al, I&#8217;m well aware you just copy and pasted what I wrote. This is what I was talking about when I mentioned confusion and blaspheme. You lack the basic grammar skills of a nine year-old because of your demonic possession. I&#8217;ve seen this happen literally thousands of times. Normally intelligent people begin babbling nonsense like yourself.</p>
<p>Folks, what you&#8217;re witnessing here is a demon who has been ousted, identified, and is in the process of being exorcised. Notice how it is lashing out now more than ever? Its time is near the end.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you that stupid that you think I was calling you father rather than seeing that the reply was addressing you only.&#8221; How very God like of you, Al. You&#8217;ve again ousted yourself as minion of Lucifer. Your time is almost up. Any last words?</p>

Without you I am nothing, with you nothing can stand against me. I ask again that you shield these lovely people from the evils of the wicked, the servants of Lucifer, who wish to corrupt and disrupt your will, Father.

<p>On top of it all the traffic court judges get 7 percent of whatever fine they impose.  Don&#8217;t you think now that if you ask the judge how much of the fine you (or whoever) are imposing, goes toward his retirement fund that there would be some conflict of interest somewhere.</p>

<p>You have addressed each of the talking points with basically the same answer, to have no government, no leadership at all.  In no way am I siding with the crooks in office but please explain to me how a voluntary system would work. Have you (figuratively speaking) taken the bull by the horns to show others?  Do you volunteer your time, labour, and sweat in exchange for food or rent?  I am sure others would like very much to visit or live life in this utopia. Tell us how this volunteer society works so I (we) can start working on putting it together. </p>
<p>I know the borders and country lines are a state of mind, please let us know how to cross the check point from south Korea to north Korea without getting shot.  Does it matter whether its a state of mind at the moment you get shot and leave this physical body on earth?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s just more lies from you. You speak lies because this is what your father Lucifer has put inside of you. This is all too common in demonic possession. But the fear in your words is a good sign. The exorcism is nearly complete. It always gets worse before it gets better. And soon it&#8217;ll be just another one bites the dust. Add it to my list that&#8217;s literally in the thousands. </p>
<p>Father God, I praise you and lift your name, your Righteousness, your Wisdom, your Holiness, for it is your love Father that gives me life and gives me strength. I call on you to finish what has been started, to remove this demonic presence from this site and from these people, and cast this evil spirit called Al back to the depths of his father&#8217;s domain, the Underworld.  Thank you Father.  Amen.</p>

<p>Yeah, now its you changing your mind.  It&#8217;s the devils work to say one thing today and another tomorrow in order to create chaos.  I see you for what you really are now.  Your not worth paying attention to anymore.  Shame on you for using God as you do. I will not be addressing you anymore and only those who wish to perpetuate their knowledge.</p>

			<p>Earlier I&#8217;ve posed these questions?</p>
<p>Mastersteve Says:<br />
May 15th, 2014 at 5:33 am<br />
Here’s a question?</p>
<p>Should any warrant have in place these for it to be a lawful instrument?</p>
<p>Any or all?</p>
<p>1. A wet signature by a judge on oath?<br />
2. A court’s stamp?<br />
3. Warrant number?<br />
4. Be an original (no electronic copies)?<br />
5. Dated?</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay again, but got somewhat unlawfully arrested, abducted once again!? Got a fee schedule in place so at some point will be raking it in!</p>
<p>Only Al: Beyer got the question right! My understanding also is that you need all five for a warrant to be effective and have authorisation but here&#8217;s my point in the UK they don&#8217;t even have one of those ticked off which makes this piece of paper void, without authority, got these coppers carrying out their unlawful axe carrying out the dirty deeds of the administrator whoever is sending these useless bits of paper out and the cops are doing their bidding with their ignorance, sheer ignorance of what It is<br />
and how it obtains it&#8217;s power ,that gives them the power because nobody is willing to put their name to warrants or stamp it , it&#8217;s unofficial, it&#8217;s unlawful it&#8217;s wrong and they get away with it and doing it out of routine, doing day in day out! Enough is enough for these ignoramuses.!!</p>

			<p>Father God, I take this opportunity once again to thank you and praise you, to lift your name,  Father. I see the desperation in this demonic spirit, Al, growing with each passing moment. It is in its last days and knows its fate as its father, Lucifer, knew his when he rebelled against you. It holds no power over your will as your will is the destiny of us all. May your love and your light shine through and penetrate this evil spirit, and cast it back to hell. In the name of Jesus I command you to leave here now! By His name and His power I command you!</p>

			<p>Al, thanks for your honesty, you are correct, some places are mean to be places just to visit, in that list I would add Cancun,  Las Vegas and Paris. I have been in all three and the only way I can permanently stay there is if I am mega rich, every thing is so expensive. It appears we will have a great Holiday weekend in here.

			<p>I don&#8217;t know if You know but there is a very controversial case going on in here, a Federal Lawsuit against the Chicago Police. They violate big time the rights of a beauty saloon owner and beat her and others because the cops thought that something ilegal was going on in there, which wasn&#8217;t. Every thing is on video so the victims have a strong case. I do believe the Chicago Police are the most corrupt of the whole United State. Cops in general are the most stupid of all  the animals worst than the donkeys, they are stupid and arrogant.</p>

			<p>Reggie, hey, you and a couple of others are the ones that started this name/character calling.  I want to ask questions to learn something whether it is from Marc or yourself.  I am not ashamed to ask something that I know not of.  But you had to take this great learning tool of Marc&#8217;s and turn it into a facebook kind of thing. (which I have no part in) </p>
<p>I want to learn something of how to combat this illegal/corrupt court system and how to spread that information. And if you knew it all, you wouldn&#8217;t be here on this site other than to create chaos.  So lets move on shall we? </p>
<p>Has anyone got any information on how to fight this system of illegalities?<br />
Any topic.  Thank you</p>

			<p>Martin, Yes, I did win 6 cases and I did them all with Psalms 91 of the KJV 1611 which is non-copyrighted unlike all other bibles in this country.  But as time has taught me, no remedy works for very long. Whether is still works today or not, I don&#8217;t know.  This is why it is very important to stay vigilant and keep putting one foot in front of the other. (keep learning) I will further explain upon request.</p>

			<p>Thanks Al, and yeah you are right this United States Government Personel is very corrupt. I went to the Law library of downtown Chicago and I norice that some of the Statutes of United States Code are not printed they have a little note &#8220;Not publish&#8221; or simple just &#8220;jump&#8221; to the next Statute without any explanation.  Why they do that?? Cause they don&#8217;t want us to know our remedies? Corrupts!!! Is all can think of.</p>

			<p>Al, how did you win 6 cases with Psalms 91? Did you file a motion to dismiss under that? I don&#8217;t mean to be mean, rude, or funny with this question. Also what kind of cases were? Drugs? Traffic? Murder? Theft?</p>

			<p>Martin, I din&#8217;t have to do anything, the judge simply said case dismissed.<br />
Traffic, and income taxes.  My wife used it to stop a home foreclosure. </p>
<p>I will just pick a starting point but know it will take some verification on your part so YOU know and not just assuming I&#8217;m telling the truth.  You will have to ask me questions from time to time but please do not allow me to move on unless you understand/comprehend what I&#8217;m about to give you.  </p>
<p>From our inception we are being reprogrammed to think/forget other things.  I am 64 yrr. old and it was not until 1968 on my way to Viet Nam in the marine corps and I was given what appeared to be a little note book size something to fit in  my breast pocket.  In the scurry to get of the plane in one piece in Da Nang, I put it in my breast pocket until a later time.<br />
But then I never saw it again. </p>
<p>But one day while helping a friend to print some stuff at office depot in Honolulu, he handed me this what appeared to be the same little book and then I remembered as though it was the day before. It was the first time I could think of what a revelation would be like. I didn&#8217;t know it then but my whole life would change from that day forward.  It was titled Psalms 91.    Imagine with all the corruption going on with the gov&#8217;t bodies but yet knowing the Federal Gov&#8217;t giving me this Psalms 91 booklet, I was torn. I found that the Federal gov&#8217;t gave all going into a battle zone this little booklet.  (I don&#8217;t know about todays world)    </p>
<p>So now I knew the Feds knew the truth of scripture but then factions within are being corrupt.  While studying this scripture the Hawaiian Kingdom had a judge that retired and was working with those of us who opposed ungodliness.  He then told me to look at the copyright of something and learn what it meant.  Attempting to shorten this a little he was holding the bible in his hand when he said this.  I looked into any bible I could pick up and sure enough they all had a copyright.  My thoughts were then How does one copyright Gods word?  [Especially, when anyone who says they're Christian are told that Gods word is the truth and how it reigns over mans word.]  Well&#8230;a simple google search found me a non-copyrighted Bible.  And thirty years later its still the only Bible I can find with no copyright, the KJV 1611 edition.  (These can be purchased at Christian Book Distributors for about 22 US notes)  The judge and the feds know what the truth is but we simply failed to bring it to them.  We choose mans law over Gods law for convenience.  So for most, not all but most the Bible become a book of convenience rather than instruction.  I then could see Hosea 4:6 coming to be more than a crackpot telling the future.  And then at the end of Revelation 19 I believe (I don&#8217;t have a bible with me as I&#8217;m writing this) it says very clearly what would happen to anyone who attempted to change His word(s). And that place is found back one chapter verse 15, &#8230;the lake of fire.  From that moment forward I&#8217;ve lived by the following; I&#8217;d rather live my life as if there is a God then to live my life without Him and die to find out there is one.   Must go now.  Do you want me to continue later?</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s sad to see the way demonic possession can alter a persons sense of reality. Like your father in Hell, you are marred with delusion and a pathological liar. The nice thing about the internet, especially with this particular format, is there&#8217;s a chronological history that can be reviewed. Let&#8217;s examine the evidence,  which anyone is welcome to do.</p>
<p>Al wrote, &#8220;NonE, why must you be an idiot.&#8221; Timestamp &#8211; May 4th, 2014 &#8211; 6:42 am. Turns out you, Al, were the first one to use name calling. Not myself or anyone else. If anyone would care to examine the evidence and show me where I or anyone else resorted to name calling prior to Al, please do, timestamp and all, and I will gladly admit fault and correct myself.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, Al, you should retract your false accusation and apologize for lying.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s always how society has been. Voluntary society was invaded by psychopaths calling themselves government and garnered duped supporters. </p>
<p>Individuals and private protection companies and DROs are better at crime prevention and dispute resolution than the current police-state crime follow up facilitated by their police-state courts.</p>

<p>Is this an example?  By making a license to drive, has the state taken away my liberty to travel? (my ability/right to volunteer)   Thanks for trying to help anyway.</p>

			<p>Al,, if you look on any maps you will find hundreds of towns with their little names, but you will not find one single map that got written State of Illinois, State of California, etc, etc, you will see Illinois, California, Alabama, etc, States do not exist is only a conception and a Corporation, the State of Illinois is located in Springfield and if you want to file a lawsuit against such state it have to be done in Springfield  and if you do it in Chicago or any other city will be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, which means you failed to bring a claim in the rigjt venue or place.There is not one single law that applies to us by means of the constitution which is their bylaws. Sooner or later the human race of this United States and the rest of the world will wake up from this stupor, or stupidity in which we are now and we will finally be free and with rights not privileges,  those are for other entities not for the human race. Don&#8217;t feel bad with my answers I am in the same stages that you are and which I can learn more from everybody in here. There are many good minds in here that provide great information like indio007 and many more. Good luck and which you the best. Beautiful Sunday in Chicau</p>

			<p>Hi Marc, please can i draw your attention to the website above, called &#8220;Council Tax Scam&#8221;, which answers many questions that folk have about &#8216;Council Tax&#8217;. The posts include about the Local Government Finance Act 1992 that the woman you spoke to referred to. It&#8217;s well-worth reading the lastest post for proper grasp of the Act and how it ONLY refers to &#8216;non-domestic&#8217; property. In this way one can quote the relevant legislation and PROVE that there is no liability and how, in fact, the Act (plus interpretations) clearly states it! Curious then, that the corporate councils refer to it at all!</p>

			<p>Martin,  I agree with all you are saying in regards to the states.  If I may add to this a little on how and when they did this.  The United States, UNITED STATES, and a couple other ways of saying it, is the corp. body in formally known as District of Columbia since 1871.  Just 10 years before that the congress defined person to be that of a corporation.  And you will also see that in 1868 the 14th amendment only applies to the person.  Now go to any of the so-called law books (i.e. State of Illinois statutes) All the states are the same way, Statutes.  Read the preface of any of them and you will see that everything within tells you it is &#8220;prima facie&#8221; and it also says they only pertain to the person.  Back in the days of Caesar in Rome he had people put on a play that sometimes caused them to hold a false mask on a stick in front of their face to portray being someone different.   They were called persons.  A falsehood.  Now bear with me as its not any one of these things but all of them put into play interacting perfectly with each other.  Now this country (America) is supposed to be stemming from Christian beliefs and backgrounds.  They never called anyone a person back then because they knew God was not a respecter of person(s).  (plenty scripture available upon request) For the person is a dean entity and its always denoted in all capital letters.  It just so happens that all business&#8217;s in the country all have capital letters and are called person.  Man created the person, not God because He doen&#8217;t deal with the dead, only the living. Your I.D. of any kind used to be in upper and lower case letters but slowly since 1968 started transforming everyone&#8217;s name into all upper case.  This is not semantics.  Now all they have to do is get us all to start using the word person and calling each other person as well.  And in law if one doesn&#8217;t respond to the allegation of being or saying something then you lose.  It&#8217;s called acquiescence. [The definition of acquiescence is the act of agreeing to something by being silent]  In the seventies a new constitution for the United States was made.  Bottom line  is, they made us all small individual corporations under the bid umbrella corporation by way of acquiescence.</p>
<p>Now which do you belong to?  The Constitution of the United States or the Constitution for the United State? </p>
<p>All this set aside for a minute.  Common sense tells me I&#8217;m a man but the law I acquiesced to says I&#8217;m a person.  This is the only way they can get the statutes to apply to us.  Even the churches that call themselves churches aren&#8217;t churches anymore, their organizations.  The IRS will tell you without any problem they don&#8217;t have any rules for a church as they cannot collect from the one who is head of the church, God.  Remember, the clergymen only work for God.  But now they all incorporated to an organization that is now taxable but don&#8217;t tax because the clergymen of the building turns over all our name and how much we donated.  Haven&#8217;t you noticed they now ask that your Social Slave number be put on the tithing envelope?</p>

Is Amazing how they got all of us t)o believe on paying the stupid irs a tax, if we don&#8217;t work for the federal government, in reality the so called tax is a donation or an insurance premium, and on and on. We all have to fight this corrupt individuals and the best weapon is KNOWLEDGE. Knowing our remedies in law and stop their PRESUMPTIONS.</p>

<p>In essence, what they did is give us all equality supposedly.  Black man was considered 2nd class while white man was 1st class.  And the powers that be used this to get us all.  Common sense tells us they would raise 2nd class to the level of 1st class creating equality.  WRONG! They lowered 1st class to that of 2nd class but we were all now equal and nobody saw the guise. Now we&#8217;re all persons.  Even though the 14th amendment was not passed properly, they still pushed it through using the equality issue.  Because of our lack of knowledge we allowed it.  </p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m going to ask you something, if your told to jump off the bridge and die, is it the fault of the one telling you to jump or the guy that jumped?</p>

			<p>She explicitly states that &#8216;these are the laws of the land&#8217; This is untrue. The Law of the LAND is common law. All &#8216;Acts&#8217; and dealings with Magistrate courts are in fact Law of the Sea. That&#8217;s why they have &#8216;Docks&#8217; and so forth. This blatant lie has been ingrained into the thinking of most people in the UK. That acts of parliament &#8216;given the force of law&#8217; are in fact inalienable and are applicable to everyone living here. In truth they are only enforceable with CONSENT into the maritime law system. Common Law is applicable to everyone. Statute Law is not. Do not contract with them and they can not hold you to any such summons. I have not paid any council tax or energy bills in over 4 years and after not contracting at all they have given up on trying to summons me at all. The trap is consent.</p>

			<p>NonE,  Scott is dealing with reality.  If one would only read the preface of the contract (the statutes) of any state, they would see that it only pertains to &#8220;person(s). This is why they also state that its only &#8220;prima facie&#8221;.  All you have to do is show them who you are when confronted by them.   Common law does apply to everyone and its simple.  One can do anything they want as long as they don&#8217;t step on the rights, life, and property of another.</p>

			<p>Al you are replying to me but you never quoted anything I wrote.</p>
<p>I am in the process of handing all the paperwork back I know the game. I am standing up and have withdrawn my consent from the Community Charge Act 1992. I informed my MP, Cheif Constable, Home Office and Home Sec that I will no longer consent to paying Council Tax.<br />
I did attempt to discharge the debt using their statutes but their corporate lawyer told me the statute meant collectively. When I asked him for case histories to validate his claim he was unable to provide a single one. Pretty damming when the statute is 125 years old.<br />
I put in a FOI asking the same question and they are using prevarication to avoid answering it. I am not easily perturbed I am now on the third FOI hoping to pin them down and give me the answer which I already know.<br />
What I want to know is where is all the money going! In my county alone they expect to raise 523 million pounds, that is half a billion from one financial year. They claim the tax is for services, here they are closing them down and turning off our street lights.  What they claim is incompatible with what they do and Action speaks louder than any words.</p>

			<p>Terry, thanks for quoting Albert Einstein, He was a great thinker and his words does make sense to me. Your analogy of the goverment actions and the Chess game also does sense to me and I do believe We have to watch every move we made with this people. In a Chess game We follow the rules and if not the game is void, with government we follow the rules but they change the rules to their favor, also in order to keep up with them in this particular Chess-game-Case situation we have to learn the meaning of the words or they will trick us and loose the game-case.</p>

			<p>They change the meaning of so many laws and to make matters worst they hide many statutes. The other day I went to the Law library in Downtown Chicago the one they have in the Federal building at Dearborn and Adams and the books did not have certain statutes and those statutes they are still in force they have not been repeal. I file a complaint in this particular building a so called 1983 Section under title 42 against a Police officer who try to intimidate me and verbally &#8220;abuse&#8221; me. I don&#8217;t believe I will win anything but at least I will put him on the record.</p>

			<p>The incident happens because he search my car without my consent thinking he will find some evidence of wrong doing to charge with something. He did not find anything or charge with anything but he did not find amusing how chalenge his authority by asking him questions like how his &#8220;law&#8221; apply to me, He was getting very stupid and then I remember Marc&#8217;s advise that is not a good idea to challenge an Idiot with a gun to challenge them in a more &#8220;safe&#8221; place like a court room.</p>

<p>My bust, sometimes I get so involved with the information, my head is thinking faster than my fingers can move and I think no one else is in on the conversation.  </p>
<p>You ask where is all the money going.  Have you checked into the CAFR?  [Comprehensive annual financial report]  All Gov&#8217;t bodies have gotten involved with this.  They have two sets of books.  And they admit to it. Walter Burien is the man credited with the discovery of them doing this.  Study that for a bit and I believe you&#8217;ll find your answer.</p>

<p>You are correct 100%.  We American need to wake up (which I think has finally happened) and start putting who&#8217;s right into political office rather than who has the most money.

<p>The so=called law books of each state and your right, they have no force or effect unless agreed to by one of us Americans.  Do you have a driver lic. or have you ever filled out a voter application since 1968?   If so, then you agreed.  [There are many other adhesions contracts that we agreed to]</p>

			<p>Martin, Do you get a license plate for your car because without it you wouldn&#8217;t be able to physically drive the car? Or, do you put a license plate on your car because it&#8217;s a psychopath deterrent?</p>
<p>Is it because a licence is a necessary functional part of a car or is it because the &#8220;government&#8221; threatened to injure you if you don&#8217;t get their license plates? Why do you put a registration sticker on your car?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s four elements to a valid contract. 1) offer 2) meeting of the minds 3) consideration and 4) agreement.</p>
<p>People like Al label licenses adhesion contracts because there is no meeting of the minds and the government threatens to kill you if you&#8217;re disobedient. It&#8217;s the same old story: people like Al want to hide the gun in the room. I&#8217;m beginning to think your a shill for Al. Actually, I didn&#8217;t just begin to think that, I&#8217;ve thought about it for a while and wonder how many others have thought similar.</p>

			<p>Andy, there is no proof that there are any adhession contracts, when I thank Al is because this fellow is always participating and trying not to bother any body unfourtunely too many people did not looked the same way I do. In the past you have a disagreement with Andrew and I side it with you because I thought he was wrong and you were right. I do not indorse anybody in here with the exception of Marc Stevens.  Marc in the past directly told me that if pointt a gun to your head there can NOT be a contract and I believe him.</p>

Let me answer this one, for most people have a LIEsence and a tax sticker/plate on the back of their private , non-commercial car for one reason, and it NOT cause we have excess amounts of legal tender to be giving it away to these parasites, its because we might get killed, tasered, assaulted, kidnapped , tortured, fined, caged, or all of the above, as many times has been documented, so AL? what part of cognitive dissidence/diss a dunce, dont you get?</p>
<p>..and I ask again for this PROOF and EVIDENCE of your alleged god/God/GOD..besides the alleged evidence of a black book, copyrighted or not, &#8230;church has its law book, and the state has their law book, the 2 of them are basically the same, no separation of church and state, both fictions using violence to get what they want, both preaching fictitious gawds and laws<br />
..agree to them or don&#8217;t, it doesn&#8217;t matter to those pirates that were bullies in high school, and will kill you to get obedience for their masters, woof woof, good K9doggie , would you like another gun to chew on?</p>
<p>..adhesion contracts?, you mean adhesion of a gun to the head? that being a meeting of the minds?, you agree, since they dont mind, pulling the trigger&#8230;benefits, goto love them?</p>
<p>..ps I agree, Al is either a shill, or a persistent gov employee doing the work for his god/dog&#8230;didnt Reggie put a spell on you to go away and stop bothering trying to force YOUR ways on others?..this is not edumakation from you, its consistent beating of your reLIEgious/gov drums. be gone shill..go preach in some other forum, and go build some more roads.</p>

<p>How old are you?  Oh, never mind, I just read your posting above.  Do your parents know you are on this computer?  </p>
<p>Your another who still didn&#8217;t answer my question.  I suppose your more interested in bragging of what little you do know than answering the question.  I did not ask you why we&#8217;re not supposed to have the license, I asked if you had one or not.  And if not, how do you get around from day to day?  Or do you ask those who do have the license to do you a favor and take you where you want to go. [which is even more disgusting]  </p>
<p>As for me, yes, I have a drivers license.  After 30 yrs. of not, I caved in an got one back in 2007.  Being able to do for my family was realized to be more important than my personal issues&#8217;s.  Even though they knew that I/we were in the right.  And any knowledge I may have was more important to share than it was for me sitting in jail not being able to share/teach.  These battles are for the new punks.  Us older ones are now teaching to those who wish to learn.   Stop wasting my time.  Love you maan.</p>

<p>Other than the rain while going through Penna. when leaving, it was a great trip.  The weather was great the whole time there in Virginia Beach.  They even have a tunnel going under the Chesapeake Bay. WOW, a new experience for me.  Hope you had a good weekend.  I see things haven&#8217;t changed much, different names&#8230;same chater.</p>

			<p>Erm Terry A from one Brit to another? </p>
<p>For the sake of clarity properly constituted contracts are ones that are binding between the two parties of both signatures to ,whereas a phone purchase package with a 12 month term or other is not a contract but merely an agreement cute fact that only one side of the party signs this is better known as a adhesion agreement ,Adhesion are those that are drafted by the party who has the greater bargaining advantage, providing the weaker party with only the opportunity to adhere to (i.e., to accept) these agreements or to reject it. (These types of agreements are often described by the saying &#8220;Take it or leave it.&#8221;) They are frequently employed because most businesses could not transact business if it were necessary to negotiate all of the terms of every contract. Not all adhesion contracts are unconscionable, as the terms of such contracts do not necessarily exploit the party who assents to the contract. Courts, however, often refuse to enforce contracts of adhesion on the grounds that a true meeting of the minds never existed, or that there was no acceptance of the offer because the purchaser actually had no choice in the bargain, phone companies including their insurance packages are very rarely fought out in the courts! I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;m right in saying Corporations are incorporated and cannot hold contracts. Trust this helps Terry A in your enlightenment of the facts?</p>

<p>Yes I know but technically they are still contracts and its really a case of Caveat Emptor.</p>
<p>Council Tax is not based on a contract it seems to be a Tort, even so it requires consent and I withdrew my consent last year.<br />
People are approaching it from different angles hoping to find the solution. Those implementing it are very very furtive, they have just changed the word benefit to reduction because no one can impose a benefit on anyone else that is a Lawful maxim.</p>

<p> As most people are aware knowledge is Power. By good research shall you find that all so called  taxes are voluntary and therefore require your consent, You are right, buyers should be aware and should always look before they leap? In its simplest form law is essentially all about contracts it&#8217;s all about business, at the end of the day it all comes down to that! simples! Simplicity is genius if the law is short and simple that it is normally a true and natural law,common law. Should you find it long and twisted,complicated then it is intended not to be clearly,concisely understood, it ought to be and intended to be misunderstood, misconstrued and lost like statues and so called tax rules and regulations were even the best tax professionals find it very difficult to understand the good majority of it , so if they&#8217;re having problems then what chance has numpty got down the street or anybody else  for that matter got! So to conclude keep it all simple!? Marc does a very good job by stating the now so obvious&#8230;&#8230;. provide the evidence of your rules /regulations and jurisdiction apply to me! Where&#8217;s the evidence that a contract exists between you and I?</p>

<p>Next<br />
The world&#8217;s best scientists and philosophers have through their work come to know (that is have gnosis a word you might want to loo up) that the Universe shows evidence that its been created by a very Intelligent Mind, which in the West is called God a word with negative connotations.<br />

<p>So, you had good intentions but are too weak-willed to actually commit to them. Apparently, you don&#8217;t see the blatant contradiction that you, a non Christian, have been accused of having an imaginary friend in the sky. Oh, I forgot, your claim is based on you imagining what Incubus thinks, not what he actually wrote.</p>

<p>&#8220;For as God, when he created matter, and endued it with a principle of mobility, established certain rules for the perpetual direction of that motion; so, when he created man, and endued him with freewill to conduct himself in all parts of life, he laid down certain immutable laws of human nature, whereby that freewill is in some degree regulated and restrained, and gave him also the faculty of reason to discover the purport of those laws. * * * This law of nature, being coeval with mankind and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. &#8211; It is binding over all the globe in all countries, and at all times; no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this: and such of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original.&#8221;<br />

<p>Appeal to authority; a logical fallacy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority</a><br />
&#8220;Fallacious examples of using the appeal include any appeal to authority used in the context of logical reasoning, and appealing to the position of an authority or authorities to dismiss evidence, [of EVOLUTION][2][3][4][5] as, while authorities can be correct in judgments related to their area of expertise more often than laypersons,[citation needed] they can still come to the wrong judgments through error, bias, dishonesty, or falling prey to groupthink. Thus, the appeal to authority is not a generally reliable argument for establishing facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note: [of EVOLUTION] is my edit.</p>
<p>While a person can have faith, faith is not a replacement for fact. I&#8217;m in agreement that humans have freewill and the ability to reason and therefore are able to conclude the validity of the NAP (non aggression principle) = a voluntary society.</p>
<p>Can you confirm that there is a witness with personal first hand knowledge the constitution and code are applicable? Can you confirm there is a witness with personal first hand knowledge that there is a valid cause of action? Can you confirm there is a witness with personal first hand knowledge that there is one or more Gods?</p>

<p>Appeal to authority; a logical fallacy. </p>
<p>ROFLMAO</p>
<p>Blackstone was an Authority the Highest Judge in the Land. The problem with people like yourself who have not read Philosophy is you don&#8217;t know when to apply the fallacy. Aint laughed that much in a while. Keep it up that was hilarious:</p>
<p>On the other hand, arguments from authority are an important part of informal logic.<br />
Since we cannot have expert knowledge of many subjects, we often rely  on the judgements of those who do. There is no fallacy involved in simply  arguing that the assertion made by an authority is true. The fallacy  only arises when it is claimed or implied that the authority is  infallible in principle and can hence be exempted from criticism.</p>
<p>Do you understand the difference Andy if not I will spell it out for you. LOL</p>

<p>I specifically quoted from Wikipedia &#8220;Argument from authority&#8221;. There&#8217;s a difference between expert/authority of which Blackstone was regards to law. And I agree with him on man having freewill and reason. Blackstone is not an expert/authority on the source, which he claims to be God. Thus the reason why I posted the three questions:</p>
<p>Can you confirm that there is a witness with personal first hand knowledge the constitution and code are applicable?<br />
Can you confirm there is a witness with personal first hand knowledge that there is a valid cause of action?<br />
Can you confirm there is a witness with personal first hand knowledge that there is one or more Gods?</p>
<p>Blackstone does justice to the first two questions but not the third question.</p>
<p>As I said/wrote, faith is not a replacement for fact. It&#8217;s more accurate to say: faith is not synonymous with fact.  quod non apparet non est. The fact not appearing is presumed not to exist.</p>

<p>No. I&#8217;m the authority/expert on my reason and freewill. Thus, as most people who have spent some time learning the methods and questions to ask that Marc has posted on this website, the importance of questions 1 and 2 are readily apparent. The third question is consistent with the Socratic method used in the first two questions, albeit, applied to a different subject.</p>
<p>1. Can you confirm that there is a witness with personal first hand knowledge the constitution and code are applicable?</p>

<p>There is no evidence the constitution and code are applicable to anyone. Even for the person that accepts a benefit from &#8220;government&#8221;, the &#8220;government&#8221; stole/taxed it in the first place and thus has no valid claim to the benefit.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s two elements to a valid cause of action. 1. the violation of an individual&#8217;s legal right; 2. an injury reasonably traceable to have been caused by a defendant.</p>

Anyone can read the dialog and see I differentiated that Blackstone was an authority/expert on law but not an authority/expert on God, whom Blackstone claims is the source.

			<p>Andy you never claimed anything about Blackstone being an Authority on God.<br />
You just dismissed him has an Authority.  Then cited wikipedia which is risible.</p>
<p>If you actually did the research and understood it you would understand that every public servant who takes an oath of office in the Commonwealth does so by proxy via the Queen&#8217;s Oath. Her Majesty swore an Oath to God on the Bible.<br />
So Blackstone would have been well aware of his Oath and he was God believing Man.</p>

<p>How stupid some can be. That doesn&#8217;t even make sense for a deduction of the true god.  </p>

Muslims god is the god of the moon.  This is why the crescent moon is on their flag.  [And I hear tell that that is where the muslims get their cheese.] </p>
<p>A muslims first duty is to kill all infidels.  Who&#8217;s an infidel?  Anyone not  muslim.   Seems a bit satanic to me.  Any praise goes to Him, the Almighty God.  The only reason you despise God is because He and His followers won&#8217;t have anything to do with the satanic ones.  And we have a muslim president who got stupid people to trade their vote for a cell phone.  </p>
<p>For the sake of making someone feel good and not hurting their feelings, its okay to burn a Bible but not a Koran.  One cannot be more hypocritical than that. Christians don&#8217;t do that but muslims do.</p>

			<p>Marc you do know that very clever scientists like Dr Francis Collins who headed up the Human genome project and the Astrophysicist Frank Tipler whose done a lot of work on the Cosmological anthropic principle and many others too numerous to mention converted to Christianity at the height of their intellectual fame, to claim they are afflicted anyway in their mental reasoning is a non sequitur and of course a crass generalisation.

			<p>Okay Marc</p>
<p>So the very first time I used your application for dismissal and have to say surprisingly though I got short shrift in a UK Crown court!</p>
<p>It had surprise and shocked me the extent of the lack of proper scrutinisation and respectful consideration towards this application by a so-called honourable judge QC status<br />
On presenting this application on entering at the same time the place of business i.e. the courthouse as entering the card it took less than 10 minutes to dismiss the application with the argument from this judge stated that because you live within the UK  we have jurisdiction  it is automatic, when asked repeatedly to provide the evidence, the simple same response was used again!</p>
<p>Therefore I&#8217;m just wondering what Marc makes of this?And want ammunition can be used to utilise to take this matter further forward with perhaps getting judgement set aside on the basis that there was a total lack of consideration towards this application and a total failure of due diligence was observed!</p>

			<p>Andy, that&#8217;s how lawyers do their work, they are sneaky and don&#8217;t forget.. an attorney is a STATE officer of the court and is firmly part of the Judicial Branch, their number one duty is to their Master the STATE, and then their &#8220;client&#8221;, they never have first hand knowledge of the facts of a case, and their testimony is irrelevant to a case, they some times try to &#8221; create&#8221; evidence by using the method you just describe&#8230; Hearsay, Andy said that I said and he said that I said etc, etc. After they do that they just wait that you did not REBUTT their self creating evidence to exhibit as a &#8220;FACT&#8221; however in your particular situation you did rebutt the wrongful hearsay testimony and now the ball is on him, he will not address the issue because is unrebbutable.</p>

			<p>Andy I refer you back to my last reply.</p>
<p>Regarding God Her Majesty the Queen claims Divine Right to Rule. If God does not exist Her Majesty has committed Fraud. </p>
<p>To understand how this came about look at what our famed English Jurist have said you can of course substitute the word King below for Queen.</p>
<p>Have a nice day people!</p>
<p>“The king has a superior, namely, God. Also the law by which he was made king. Also his curia, namely, the earls and barons, because if he is without a bridle, that is without law, they ought to put the bridle on him.” [30] &#8220;The king has no equal within his realm. Subjects cannot be the equals of the ruler, because he would thereby lose his rule, since equal can have no authority over equal, not a fortiori a superior, because he would then be subject to those subjected to him. The king must not be under man but under God and under the law, because the law makes the king&#8230; for there is no rex where will rules rather than lex. Since he is the vicar of Jesus Christ, whose vicegerent on earth he is&#8230;&#8221;<br />

<p>&#8220;Amazing fine tuning occurs in the laws that make this [complexity] possible. Realization of the complexity of what is accomplished makes it very difficult not to use the word &#8216;miraculous&#8217; without taking a stand as to the ontological status of the word.&#8221;<br />
George Ellis (British astrophysicist)</p>
<p>&#8220;I find it quite improbable that such order came out of chaos. There has to be some organizing principle. God to me is a mystery but is the explanation for the miracle of existence, why there is something instead of nothing.&#8221;<br />
Alan Sandage (winner of the Crawford prize in astronomy)</p>
<p>&#8220;We are, by astronomical standards, a pampered, cosseted, cherished group of creatures.. .. If the Universe had not been made with the most exacting precision we could never have come into existence. It is my view that these circumstances indicate the universe was created for man to live in.&#8221;<br />
John O&#8217;Keefe (astronomer at NASA)</p>
<p>&#8220;As we survey all the evidence, the thought insistently arises that some supernatural agency &#8211; or, rather, Agency &#8211; must be involved. Is it possible that suddenly, without intending to, we have stumbled upon scientific proof of the existence of a Supreme Being? Was it God who stepped in and so providentially crafted the cosmos for our benefit?&#8221;<br />
George Greenstein (astronomer)</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea of a universal mind or Logos would be, I think, a fairly plausible inference<br />
from the present state of scientific theory.&#8221;<br />
Sir Arthur Eddington (astrophysicist)</p>
<p>&#8220;Astronomy leads us to a unique event, a universe which was created out of nothing, one with the very delicate balance needed to provide exactly the conditions required to permit life, and one which has an underlying (one might say &#8216;supernatural&#8217;) plan.&#8221;<br />

			<p>Martin when I am in the wrong I am the first to hold my hands up.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t say all those working for the system are bad, many are just ignorant because they have been inculcated to believe legislation is the Law. Clearly that is not the case. Statutes require our consent I have withdrawn my consent from the Community Charge Act 1992.<br />
Roger has not paid it for 5 years, i know of other people in similar situations. Its all a Con the Corporate lawyer for my county told me they will raise over half a billion pounds this year. They are shutting down the services, street lights being turned off at night and no one knows where the money is going.<br />
I attempted to discharge the debt using the 1888 local government act and that remedy was denied. The lawyer for the County Council claimed it applied collectively. I asked him to show me case histories where this was previously done and he could not show me a single one.<br />
I think they just make everything up and one day when we get this country back under Common Law Juris we will be able to put these people on trial in front of Grand Juries and jail them after due process. </p>

			<p>Martin, we have to win hearts and minds, been telling the youngsters that elsewhere,I  must be getting through because the next minute the lad posted a photo with him shaking the hands of a policy man.<br />
The lad in question was escorted of a bus for trying to pay with legal tender. When he asked the 4 constables to produce their warrant cards they all refused to do so, a clear breach of PACE.<br />
I have made a formal complaint having witnessed it via social media. The problem is they hide behind the police reform act of 2003 which puts police men and women above the Law. This is why my prognosis that Law and Order will break down is becoming more evident daily.</p>

They have been trained to use violence, but most of them are naturals and don&#8217;t need any advise. They enjoy the protection of a fiction ( the STATE) and they think they are invinvible. In order to qualify for the job of police the requirements here are that they have to be stupid, the more stupid the better chance to get hired by the fictional entity.</p>

			<p>OK All Knights of freedom!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s official well in the UK that is with regards to providing evidence that your rules and regulations and that you have jurisdiction over apply to me.<br />
A UK Judge said: “The evidence is here all around you. You are in a court of law and you are here because a case has been brought against you in a magistrates court for hearing in the crown court.</p>
<p>“You are subject to the jurisdiction of the court like every other person in England.</p>
<p>“You are no different from anyone else who lives in England he added.</p>
<p>Judge then pointed out that the man had not entered pleas to the charges against him.</p>
<p>When read out because the man refused to accept the written indictment (this is defined and disguised as a new bill)<br />
handed to him the three charges refused to enter a plea.</p>
<p>Judge said this should be listed as not guilty on all three counts.??&#8230;.<br />
Don&#8217;t recall this judge being given the power of attorney and as such he must accept all liabilities for excepting the pleas and dismiss the case against this man!?</p>

			<p>So on point Incubus,<br />
Andy,<br />
Martin Padilla </p>
<p>There is more to this blatant disregard for the norms of civil and harmonious life?<br />
For asking a civil,calm and reasonable question as Marc has so eloquently directed and laboured the point out by now&#8230;&#8230;.<br />
&#8220;Show me the Evidence that your rules and regulations apply to me, show me the evidence of jurisdiction over me!&#8221;<br />
For asking this very simple question in a place of business/so-called English courthouse this is what to expect each and every time, with a breach of the peace, being stitched up with resisting arrest so they can pin another charge on you and if you don&#8217;t turn up to their summonses/ invite you can expect them to issue a voided warrant, come and bulldoze your door down at any time of the day or night! Be abducted and incarcerated for hours or days at a time.<br />
As a result of this you can also expect these unexceptable rights to privacy,family life,to be ignored.<br />
Oh and if that isn&#8217;t enough expect them to involve &#8230;&#8230;.Bulying,intimidation,threats,coerce,mind games mental and physical abuse, humiliation,<br />
The list is endless all administered from this so called government state system ,police state, the judicial system sadly,it&#8217;s time to bring it all down it&#8217;s all one big fat scam, its corrupted beyond redemption, Time for change,for a revolution and evolution let&#8217;s all come together and change this parasite of a system gone wrong the destroyers of people and family life&#8217;s.</p>
<p>When your in a British police cell airing your views on the UN universal human rights and their custody sergeant states &#8220;oh those laws don&#8217;t apply in here!&#8221; Then you know you are truly f&#8230;ed and so is this rotten system.</p>
<p>The only thing we need to be very afraid of? is not ourselves! But so called GOVERMENTS!</p>

<p>I agree that something has to be done but aren&#8217;t these governments made up of people such as ourselves that we put (by vote) in whatever office to handle what we thought was wrong?  Then unless someone has a better system I think its us who have to re-think the morals and principles of those we voted in.   It appears that those in government 150 yrs. ago were of a better mind set.  But then they believed and practiced believing in God rather than the Godless mind set they have today.  Whether we believe in God or not, the facts (or logic) would dictate that we go back to the same morals and principles.  Evidence shows that the Godless mindset doesn&#8217;t works.</p>

Statism is a cancer that will need more advance treatment and knowledge to the masses of how the fraud had been perpetuaded on us for so many years will wake them up and that can be the begining of the end for them.

<p>Martin, I understand that that is what has been happening and its a real shame.  To say &#8221; new “people” will not make the difference&#8221; is to say that we are all the same.  We may all have the ability to be as corrupt as another but our principles and morals make us different with the ability to do things in a &#8220;whats right&#8221; manner for all. And I also know that its only because we apparently put people into a government office that has the most money for advertisements.  We have this stupid thought that one party is better than the other.  I have faith that one day we will wake up to start voting for the principles and morals of one over the other.  Whether there is a God or not, its the belief and faith of there being a God along with the ability to differ right from wrong that makes some of us different for the better. We&#8217;ve allowed change from the good book for the sake of convenience to pacify the atheist and perversions of some when all along its a book of instruction.  One day we will wake up.  Another example is we&#8217;ve allowed ourselves to believe that a democracy is the same as the Republic originally set up by our forefathers.  Democracy (mob rules) is not the same as a Republic.  One man can be right while the other 11 are wrong.</p>
