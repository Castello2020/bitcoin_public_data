Record Cold in Interior Alaska � heading into the USA, agriculture at risk
watts Up With That? ^

reader agimarc writes: As with the Lower 48 states, spring is late and cold here in central Alaska. Fairbanks reported a record low of 2 degrees F above zero Sunday, breaking the previous record of 8 from 1924.Here in Anchorage, looks like we are around 3  4 weeks late with ice of local lakes and snow off the ground. Winter was not particularly hard, but it all changed with a very cold April. And at this point it does not appear things will be warming up soon. So much for manmade global warming due to carbon dioxide emissions.Story here: http://www.adn.com/2013/04/29/2883299/interior-alaska-sees-record-breaking.htmlYes, have a look at the image at right.Here is a complete list of record lows for Alaska in the past 7 days, 996 new record lows were set (click low temp and details tab):http://wx.hamweather.com/maps/climate/records/7day/usak.html?cat=maxtemp,mintemp,snow,lowmax,highmin,And the cold is now creeping into the USA, look at the difference between Denver and Kansas City: Expect a whole new crop of record lows for the USA, and some serious issues to develop with agriculture in the nations breadbasket as a result.Only 5% Of Corn Crop Planted
This in contrast to last year at this time of 49% of the corn crop planted and the five year average of 31%

This is directly or indirectly due to our irresponsible carbon footprints I suppose.
The solution: more widespread and higher taxes and of course guilt.

Now there’s an inch of snow on the ground.

This report confuses me as I live in Southern Oregon and it’s unseasonably hot: mid 80’s all week-weekend. Evening lows in 40’s - not bad.

Someone call Al Gore and the “experts” on “Global Warming”
Record Setting May Snowfall Likely for parts of Arkansas
Snowfall in May in the State of Arkansas just doesn’t happen, but that could very well change by Friday morning. John Robinson of the National Weather Service in Little Rock went in search of records of a May snowfall in the State, but could not find a report of snow later than April 30th. On April 30th 1903, a trace of snow was reported in Fayetteville and Harrison. The latest measurable snowfall was recorded on April 24th 1910 in Corning, Arkansas. As for Little Rock, the latest snowfall ever recorded was on April 19th 1983. ALL of these records are in jeopardy. Here is a look at some various computer model snowfall projections through Saturday morning.

I heard on a talk radio show yesterday that i'ts already the second coldest spring on record. Sun's magnetic field declining leading to low sun spot counts....if this keeps up expect another 400 year long mini ice age.

About 3 F here now over 9100 feet just east of some high peaks at about 39 degrees latitude. Will probably go below 0 within about four hours or so.

I do enjoy it. It is a challenge in the winter. But, it is beautiful.
And the summer, if it ever comes, makes up for the winter.

No, it is still lingering. Lake Travis is over 50 feet low. It is the main source of drinking water for Austin and surrounding cities.
I just finished my night shift. It is 47 with winds gusting to 40 mph. Sure was cold walking around the outside of the buildings.

Also, reprint the infamous 1970’s Time Magazine “Global Cooling” cover.

it’s all my fault. No really. let me explain.
Last year at the end of summer I got a smoking hot deal on a lake home. we moved in, enjoyed 2 weeks of lake fun, then it snowed.
I have bad luck.
the lake thawed out 3 days ago.. Now it just teases us as it snows here in Minnesota.

I should note, I have lived here before.
1999-2002
I loved it then as well.
But, I spent a lot of time deployed and missed some of the weather.

We’re not really having a spring here in Northern Illinois. All of April felt like March and recently we’ve had 2 days in the 80’s and maybe 3 in the 60’s but that’s it. Goes right back to feeling downright winter-ish. Especially at night when I get home from work. What happened to days of mild 60’s working into the 70’s with the approach of May? We don’t get too much of that anymore. It goes from high of 38 one day to 80 2 days later and then to high of only 50. I remember springs of my youth being windbreaker weather with mild light rainy days. Nowadays seems we go from fall coats to shorts for the most part.

The East Coast is actually getting a spring, after a couple of years of going right from winter to summer. Enjoying it mightily.
So it’s always “normal” somewhere.

Sun’s magnetic field declining leading to low sun spot counts....if this keeps up expect another 400 year long mini ice age.
Best book I have read is “The Chilling Stars”. These guys appear to have nailed what drives the temperature on Earth. As the solar system goes above and below the arms of the Milky Way galaxy spiral arms, the cosmic radiation fluctuates. As the Sun’s magnetic field ebbs and flows the solar wind fluctuates. The solar wind keeps the cosmic radiation away from the Earth. When we have peak cosmic radiation and minimum solar wind the Earth gets cold and vice versa.
Why? Because cosmic radiation seeds cloud formation which insulates the Earth from the Sun. More clouds = cold, less clouds = hot. Also, less magnetic field strength on the Sun means less sunspots which probably reduces the total heat getting to us. We are currently in an extended solar minimum over the last few years for the Sun. From 2007 to 2009 we also saw a huge cosmic radiation increase:
“In 2009, cosmic ray intensities have increased 19% beyond anything we’ve seen in the past 50 years,” says Richard Mewaldt of Caltech. “The increase is significant, and it could mean we need to re-think how much radiation shielding astronauts take with them on deep-space missions.”
Which puts us in the worse case scenario for cooling based on their theory.
The cool thing is you can run the solar cycle and the solar system path back in time to match the temperature measured in the past. You can also run them forward to predict the next ice age. By the way, they actually verified it with geological ice core samples and helped to pin down a problem for ion dating based on their research.
The global warming mafia did everything in their power to shut these guys down that wrote the book. The funny thing is a beer company funded them in their greatest time of need. The beer company actually gave them more than they asked for because they were annoyed that the scientific community was trying to black list them.
So here we have a plausible, verifiable, working theory that explains even the anomalies of global temperature change vs. the man-made political pseudo science of CO2 fears that doesn’t work and has failed. Of course, the Chilling Stars theory is rejected because it tells us that we have very little impact on anything compared to the sun and solar system traveling through the galaxy, which means we can’t create the next big unsolvable problem for politicians to build a career on by being power brokers and controlling the industrial economy.
