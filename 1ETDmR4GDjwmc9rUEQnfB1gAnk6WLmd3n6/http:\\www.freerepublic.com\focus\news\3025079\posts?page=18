Satan wins back the Boy Scouts

Many pundits are weighing in on the decision by the Boy Scouts of America to allow open homosexuality into the organization. I, for one, am not surprised. The very fact that the leadership organized a vote on the question instead of simply standing firm on its existing policy, which was backed by a large majority of scouting parents and a US Supreme Court victory no less, told me all I needed to know. The amoral fat cats now running this once venerable organization wanted the change to preserve their "gay"-controlled corporate donor base but wanted the blame to fall on others. If anyone really believes this already destructive capitulation by the BSA will remain limited to the boys and not extend to the leaders, or that the homo-fascists are going to be placated by this half-measure, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you. I say we should take the whole organization down as quickly as possible to make room for a replacement that will protect and serve the boys and not the perverts. Here is my contribution to that effort: a little historical context to show the danger America's youth are now facing in a homosexualized scouting movement. As the saying goes, those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat its tragedies.

So how did they get all the delegates to be pro-gay? I agree, shut it down and start over...but set it up so there is no body that could become pro-gay and ruin it again, learn from mistakes!

There is NO WAY a person can support or donate to the Boy Scouts anymore without having the Gaystapo spin it as “See! They support gay scouting!”
And as I said before, get ready for headlines like “Scouting numbers decline, but NOT AS MUCH AS WE THOUGHT”, and once again, it will be spun as a victory for the pervs.
It’s a sad day in America when any group can simply take over an institution. Of course, the media whores share the blame...

This is but one reason I never donated money to United Way.
Firstly, I do not appreciate being strong-armed on a job to donate anything to anybody anywhere.
Secondly, they were strong-arming the Boy Scouts towards the gay agenda.
I feel sorry for decent men, women and kids in the Boy Scouts. Some in another city were donating clothes to the poor and I was able to give them some items towards their goal.

The Armed Services got many recruits from the BSA, mainly because the boys had learned to work in cohesive units toward a goal. In other words, they learned leadership skills useful to the military. Sounds like another part of Obama's overall plan to destroy everything in his path.

I think that this whole thing is a perfect illustration of how a foundational institution is infiltrated, corrupted and destroyed by the left.
I mean it is literally a text book example of how to.
It’s a real shame. I was a scout, and at the time there was no talk of any of this nonsense whatsoever. What it was was men making better men of younger men and younger men making better younger men of boys.
I believe this is a dynamic that is needed if men are to be good men and their purpose is to make more good men. I know that may sound cryptic, but it means exactly what it says. And there is no room for homosexuality anywhere in the process. None.

Boy Scout traditionalists should just leave the organization and form another faith based Judaeo-Christian association.
Let the “Boy Scouts” go on as a withered fruit - the decrepit relic of a Homosexualized shell. Maybe they can change the name from “Cub” Scouts to “Pansies”.

The BSA have over $1 billion in cash, over 700 million in net assets after liabilities.
They may have made themselves a target by having such a large endowment.
They need to transfer the funds to lower levels before it dies. We don’t want to leave them a $1 Billion slush fund to promote the gay agenda.

Read the article. It is an exceptionally well researched article about the roots of the scouting movement in Germany in the late 19th and early 20th century and how they where destroyed by the pederast perverts. It is quite enlightening.

Someone else will start a new organization that doesn’t promote anal sex between males. Team Obama might fight it though. Perhaps Obama will go ‘Gibson Guitar’ on them.

Not sure about the voting breakdown, but I read a comment at the article's original link that said AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson was "the motivator" behind the vote. I looked that up and found this, about the AT& T CEO/BSA connection. Disgusting!

We had our first troop meeting since the announcement last night. The dads got together along with the Scoutmaster to discuss it all. We all agreed to ride it out and deal with any homo kids as bullies. Not that we are likely to see any. Troop dads in this troop are a very macho bunch.

Does anyone have a breakdown on who in the Boy Scouts actually voted for this abomination and their profile? Being a private organization, there is no way we can know. There is no way to examine the voting process, the delegate selection, or the integrity of the vote. The BSA basically decided how it would be, and then concocted this laughable theater to attempt to present to the public their pathetic justification for the change. But it's as transparent as the Obama Admin is opaque. And that was my nice analysis.

Turning boys into emasculated metrosexuals is necessary if the U.S. Dictatorship is to successfully kill our Constitution and our freedoms. Sissy boys don't fight back. Secondly, when our military is undermined with females, gays, lesbians and emasculated boys groomed by the Gay Scouts, the Dictator can be assured they'll be submissive and not fight to save the 'traditional Republic founded by those evil heterosexual white guys'. The Dictatorship's goal is to emasculate males and kill their will to revolt against the police state. Apparently, it's working.

Well, that’s one discussion. Now, how about getting the Troop Committee to do its job? And, while you’re about it, it might be a good idea to get some input from the Chartering Organization, too. When you have those ducks in a row and quacking in unison, then you might have a plan.
Just an FYI, the Scoutmaster does not run the troop. I’ve already BTDT and saw a good SM leave because he couldn’t understand that simple organizational principle. The Committee, registered and approved as such by the Chartering Organization, is the responsible group.

take your boys OUT of BoyScouts right away!
move them to another organization that at least tries to teach and maintain some moral values for the kids
nothing, nobody’s perfect but an official policy permitting open homosexuality in a boy’s group is intolerable
parents who leave their boys in Scouts should be charged with child abuse, as certainly should be the leaders of the Scout organization!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I’m suspicious of the Mormon contingent in the BSA. I can’t help but wonder if the LDS is hoping to use gay marriage to maneuver polygamy to legal status.
Because I see a parallel in polygamous Muslim culture which is also rife with pederasty. Boys for pleaure, women for children.

they should be charged with child abuse or, probably easier to get convictions on, “contributing to the delinquency of a minor”
if good people with boys in Scouts start filing such charges with their local District Attorney/ Attorneys General, it just might do the trick (of propelling a correction, retraction of this horrible new policy)

I have to disagree with your stay-and-fight strategy. A lot of us tried that with the Episcopal Church; eventually it became apparent the heretic-sodomites had won. I was lucky to get out before I was personally sued as a Vestryman in a rebel parish.Even if you can hold the line in your troop, in all likelihood there will be all sorts of mandatory offensive "sensitivity training" National will insist on.Furthermore, I just don't want to give the pricks the satisfaction of gloating that not many folks left.So, unless our Council leaves the national BSA immediately (there is a rumor to that effect), within two weeks I will resign as Assistant Scout Master and take my son out.Good news is that alternative organizations are quickly forming.

If I were part of the governance of a Chartering Organization of any stripe, I would have to sadly recommend that we no longer charter a BSA unit. The new policy opens the possibility for the chartering group to have a liability, no matter how they choose to administer the new policy. If they do as your informal meeting proposed, any youth that is disciplined can raise holy heck and have the weight of the policy behind him. If you simply implement the new policy, any claim of improper activity would immediately create a liability situation for the chartering organization.
The safe thing is to not have the liability exposure. It is a sad but true fact of today’s world, IMO. Unfortunately, it’s LOSE - LOSE - LOSE all the way around.

One need only look at the military for the example.So, unless our Council leaves the national BSA immediately (there is a rumor to that effect)... I hope that happens for you and in lots of other places, too. Please take a moment to post on that development on FR if it should occur.

Or rather many will jump ship and join any of the Christian based organizations.
“Scout troops will be disbanded all across America and those doing so will be branded as HOMOPHOBIC and RACIST. We cannot win against the opposition that are now in control of America - it is over.”

What the rank and file want and do isn’t necessarily the same thing as that of the leadership.
Sorta like the GOP nominating first McPain and then Romney, but the rank and file don’t deliver their votes.
Romney single handedly enforced the MA Supreme Courts order on gay marriage, the one the legislature was ignoring. He could have ignored it too. But he didn’t.
Been suspicious ever since.
