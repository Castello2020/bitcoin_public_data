A new reality show focuses on five single moms-to-be who are on the lookout for love. Pregnant & Dating, which is set to air on WE tv on June 1, follows Kiesha, Shana, Melissa, Megan and Rachel as they hit the dating scene with their ever-growing baby bumps. A press release for the ten-part series, filmed in Los Angeles and North Carolina, states: 'Not even pregnancy will keep these women "out of the game".' Facebook

And if one were to be an eligible bachelor, what reason would one have to choose a single mom to date?

Single mothers need help. They don’t need to be on a TV show to be idolized.
The majority of children born these days are born to single mothers.

This show, in a nutshell, is a prime example of why “traditional” marriage is on life support in this country? Why can a small minority of gays redefine marriage? Because women like these already have redefined it to be so watered down that it is almost meaningless. This program is an example of how far we have fallen.

Well, obviously they aren’t waiting for ring before they put out. And since they are pregnant, no worries on knocking them up. Plenty of horny guys would totally hit that, at least once.

This is probably WAY TMI, but when I was single, it was tough for me. I dated a couple girls in a row that would let me wine and dine them, they were not however having sex with me. I had to break it off when they became pregnant. This had such a traumatic affect on me, Trust issues and what not, I didn’t go on any more dates from age twenty to age twenty six. I have read that those are a mans sexual peak years, but I wouldn’t know.

They don’t need charity. Their problems would be solved if they just said two simple words.

That is only partially accurate...your figure is for women under the age of thirty AND having less than a college education. For the US 40% of live births are to unwed mothers.

Happens all the time; the kind of loser guy that wants to live on the real dad’s dime (in the home originally occupied by the real dad). I couldn’t imagine it myself; these guys apparently don’t realize they’re next on the curb (and the sow collects TWO checks per month)...

Consider yourself lucky, spared a life of debt slavery. If they could pin it on you they’d be still having sex with others, and you’d be subsidizing it.

And if one were to be an eligible bachelor, what reason would one have to choose a single mom to date? If they're already pregnant with someone else's kid, you have total certainty they can't become pregnant off YOU and hit you for child support for the next 18 years (which happens with women -- they just say "I guess I forgot my birth control"). Of course, you would need to dump them as soon as they have the baby.

What type of loser man would even want to date these women? My thoughts exactly. Let them go after the guy they let knock them up, stupid sluts. Now they are on the hunt for some sucker to take over after some other guy did the deed? If they do find some idiot, he deserves what is coming to him.

A lot of girls go after the bad boys for the excitement, and then sponge off the "good boys" (who, of course, are too unexciting to actually have sex with). Be glad you didn't find yourself married to one, having little or no sex, and wondering why your kids don't look like you. The solution? Stop being too "nice". Be the bad boy. You get laid more often. Look at the elder Boston Bomber, who married a gorgeous American girl by being the ultimate bad boy.

I guess for the pregnant women It’s like advertising that they’re a slut and looking for a man to support them at the same time and that you’re the next victim that will get suckered into aging child support hen she leaves you for another man. So many are just addicted to the romance and courtship aspect for the gifts, vacations / weekend getaways prize money. They might as well have marked Bob Barker...lol

With the way courts are these days, I would not bet on that.
Seriously I know a guy that’s been paying child support on a kid that’s not his for years and I bet there are a whole lot more. The mother is white, he’s white, the kid is half black. He went to the court system and tried to get them to do a paternity test after he had Ben paying child support for the past 3 years and the judge said that since he’d been making the child support payments all along and had never contested it before that he would have to keep paying it! He hadn’t seen the kid for years at that point because she wouldn’t let him and kept moving around all over the place. I know he’s been paying for at least 10 years now. This is a real injustice. I say a paternity case should be mandatory whenever there is a claim made to secure it.
