Good news for 5.56. Still waiting for this to happen to 9mm. Barring any weird news events, I expect 9mm to become more readily available and cheaper in the next couple of months.

Still planing on telling Cheaper Than Dirt to go F themselves.They have a right to charge whatever they want, but being the first to charge the highest is no way to win over customers.

I know that 22LR is the broader gauge (so to speak...!) but I shoot a lot of 556 so I tend to watch that. Any idea on 22 LR price trends?

Let’s make May “Boycott Overpriced Ammo Month”. If everyone refuses to buy at the hyperinflated prices, they will be forced to lower their prices.

Sorry, I may have misread your question ... when it comes to .22 I don’t buy boxes of 50, I buy bricks of 500, 550 or whatever, 2 of them is an afternoon at the Range. Buckets of 1700 will last a bit longer (used to bitch about Magazine thumb, now I miss it)

Eventually, market forces will drive down prices. Remember those who took advantage this time around and do not buy from them in the future.

I’ve got enough stock, that I was tempted to sell some when it was above 90 cents/rd.
Problem was, I couldn’t figure a safe way to advertise for just one transaction of 1000 rounds.

Not a good deal compared to what it used to cost, but seeing as you couldn’t even get 5.56 for the first three months this year, prices are going down and availability is increasing.

I suspect now that Congress has told DHS they can’t buy 1.6 Billion rounds of ammo to kill us all 5 times over, the price of ammunition is finally gonna drop. Who knows, all the “hoarders” may get bit in the ass and have to sell at a loss once ammunition floods the market...

I’m thinking of hitting the gun show tomorrow, Washington Arms Collectors at the Puyallup fairground in Washington state. These guys ALWAYS have boatloads of ammo... not sure of the recent price, I have about 1000rds of .223 so I never got any there. They also sell tons of 7.62X39

Supply and demand. A thing is worth exactly what another will give for it. If its selling at that price it’s worth that price. At least it’s available! Those whining “price gouging” fail to see: if it were cheaper, it would be gone.
Don’t complain they’re charging too much, berate yourself for not getting when the gettin’ was good.

Yes. Could be a mad rush to dump ammo. It would serve some people right to sustain a loss after outrageous price gouging. However, I think the supply will gradually increase and prices will slowly decline. There’s still a lot of pent-up demand for some calibers of ammo, specifically 9mm and .22lr.

There is such a thing as stupid business practices. If someone charges very high prices during market scarcity, they will lose the good will of long-standing customers when market conditions return to normal. Everyone understands that prices are linked to supply and demand. However, just because you can charge more due to scarcity, is it a wise long-term business strategy to do so. The restraint of many vendors during this ammo/gun shortage will be favorably remembered and rewarded by their customers and the excess of others will also be remembered and responded to accordingly.

Pricing includes recouping enough to buy the next batch to sell. CTD isn’t the only one in the supply chain marking up.

Not having any to sell doesn’t help retain customers either.
Old joke:
Customer - “You charge too much! The butcher down the street is selling pork chops for $5/lb! You are charging $10/lb!”
Butcher - “So go buy from him.”
Customer - “But he has none!”
Butcher - “Fine. When I sell out, I’ll charge $5/lb too.”

Everybody’s definition of what is a reasonable price “mark-up” is entirely subjective. In the case of CTD, the consensus, I have seen from visiting ar15.com and other gun forums, is that they went too far. It will be interesting to see who the market will favor as things get closer to normal.

A thing is worth exactly what another will give for it.Economic decisions are rarely made solely on dollars and cents. I'll pay a premium for good service.Sending out catalogs without printed prices so that the price can be as high as possible when you order is the inverse of that service.

CTD pulled all of their firearms off their site after Newton. A little message popped up that said "CTD doesn't sell firearms." Then they received a bunch of nasty grams; near immediately. Then they tried to say they were just reviewing their sales practices/policies to make sure they were still in line with the various laws. Then they blasted all their prices through the roof; not just on ammo. This was well before the prices really started to soar. They were selling AR mags (USGI made by the lowest bidder) for around $60 each when they were available elsewhere for anywhere from $15-30. The one not entirely stupid thing they did, was donate to the 2d Amendment Foundation. But, by that point they had already pissed off a good portion of their customers. I know several people (myself included) that will not purchase from them; and I WAS a pretty frequent customer prior. centerfiresystems, and sportsmansguide are awesome and I will continue to be their customer. They were continuing to have sales; while their prices increased, they were still offering lower than everyone else.

Personally I’ve been waiting for .223 and .308 to come down ... just ordered 1,000 rds of .223. Paid too much, but I’m running low and wanted it so I could take the kids shooting.

I backordered ammo from Cabela’s in Jan. It took three months to ship. I was fortunate to get it. The cost, while high by last year’s standards, .50/round is better than most places now-a-days. The price of .223 and .308 is coming down and the supply is becoming more plentiful. I see a light at the end of the tunnel.
In the next couple of months, as things return to something like normal, I will resume my normal bulk purchases of ammo. I will slowly build my stock again. This time I will keep twice as much as I had last time. I got through this ammo panic better provisioned than most of my friends. I even sold some of my ammo at pre-panic cost to these friends. However, I learned an important lesson. I will stack it deeper in the future.

CTD can KMA. I'll say this though: Rock River Arms honored the price for the 4 Magazines I ordered from them when everyone else was jacking up the price on AR-15 Mag's by 5-10x. Far as ammunition goes, I'll never buy from CTD after the gouging they did.

I haven’t needed to buy ammo as I have been hoarding it for 10 years. 50K of 5.56/.223 Rem. in a 60/40 split.
Now OTOH I haven’t been shooting it for the last 2-3 years trying to keep it on hand for when the SHTF.
This is the most bizzare time I have ever seen in my life. Even when Clinton was in office, you could still buy bricks of .22LR on sale at Walmart. Now...my local Wally World has but a few boxes of 20 ga and 410 ga.
As a side note,
I was with a friend who went to Dick’s and he wanted to buy some .45 and 9mm. They asked to see his pistol permit, and wouldn’t sell him the 9mm because he didn’t have a 9mm registered on his permit. (the 9mm was for his converted AR.) I was floored, and walked out. Told the manager I wouldn’t buy water from them if I was on fire.
Not that Dick’s had any ammo either, but they are off the list of qualified vendors.

Good on you for having ample ammo.
Pistol permits — we don’t have those in Texas unless you are carrying concealed in which case it is a “shall issue” state where it is very easy to get a concealed carry license as long as you have no criminal record.
I will never shop at Dick’s Sporting Goods. They have an irrational fear of black rifles. Basically, Dicks has been a “Fudd” retailer (no military-type arms, only hunting rifles). For a few tepid months, Dick’s had a special contract with Troy Industries to sell their very decent AR rifles. But, this did not last long. After the Newtown shooting, Dick’s stabbed Troy Industries in the back and all its customers who had placed an order for this rifle by cancelling all orders and making it store policy to not sell those evil “assault rifles”. Because of their stupidity, I will never shop there again.

I tend to think we're about to start in on a civil war, but if we don't I believe the coming storm will be an evil that will make NAZI Germany look tame.

I live in the socialist hell known as New York.
I have a CCW permit and have a 9mm registered on it, so I could have bought the ammo for my friend. But under the unSAFE Act they do a background check on you for ammo purchases, and take down the lot number of the ammo you purchase. Needless to say, I drive to Pennsylvania (about an hour away) to buy ammo and bring it back.
I won’t be going into Dick’s again. They are now off the list, for anything.

I visited Adventure Outdoors this morning (one of the big Atlanta Area dealers Bloomberg sued). They had pallets of 9mm and .45 Auto. They had stock of other calibers on the shelves. One box limits on most still. The place looked like a ghost town compared to the last three months. So hopefully the panic has subsided. With copper and lead commodity prices falling maybe ammo prices will become affordable soon.

Well, no plinking or hunting sports for me for the rest of this year, then. It'll be a good time to save money and catch up on a few other important things for self-sufficiency (to get richer instead of poorer). Starve the beast--every kind of crooked beast.
