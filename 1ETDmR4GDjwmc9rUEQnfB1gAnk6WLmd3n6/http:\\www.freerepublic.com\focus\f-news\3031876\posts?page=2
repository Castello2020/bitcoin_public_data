Report: Iran to send 4,000 Revolutionary Guards to bolster Assad�s forces

Iran is to reportedly send 4,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards to Syria to support President Bashar al-Assad in the fight against opposition forces, according to the The Independent on Sunday. In what was described as an Iranian military decision, the British newspaper said Iran was now fully committed to preserving Assads regime, citing unnamed pro-Iranian sources. The sources have been deeply involved in the Islamic Republics security, even to the extent of proposing to open up a new Syrian front on the Golan Heights against Israel, The Independents Robert Fisk wrote. The decision, allegedly made before this weeks presidential election, was to send a first contingent of 4,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards to Syria to support President Bashar al-Assad's forces against the largely Sunni rebellion, Fisk reported. Iran is a predominantly Shiite Muslim country, and a close ally of President Assad, who belongs to the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. Earlier this month Iran congratulated the Syrian army on their victory in the strategic central town of Qusayr after an 18-day battle....

With all these different groups having vested themselves into the outcome of this conflict they are making it a focus point for all the world’s self interests - I pity the poor b#stards of the general population with bombs and weapons from all sides flying over their heads.

Sarah Palin said Until we have a commander in chief who knows what he is doing... let Allah sort it out!. I agree wholeheartedly. Let's not allow the idiots Obama & John Kerry to get us entangled in a web spun by who knows what spider.

I guess they heard Obama declared he wasn’t going to send troops at all. Just some small weapons and ammo.
Well, It looks like the O has been checkmated. Why do you doofusses tip your hand. You have no sense of strategery.

The question is can the people of Iran ever get their revolution right?
The fall of the Shah represented their leaning towards a more Western philosophy of society and government. The muzzies stepped into the vacuum and took over, as we have seen time and time again in the middle east.
I knew a number of Iranians during the 70’s and 80’s when I was in college. They were TO A MAN intensely interested in Western art, society, government, history, science.
The new president is quite a moderate. Trouble is, it takes millions of people to get him elected, but it only takes one bat shit crazy FN muzzie fanatic to send him to his final destination.
And I make ZERO APOLOGIES for speaking the truth about the muzzies. We ignore it at our peril.

The new president is quite a moderateAccording to news reports, he's the most moderate of the choices the voters had. So where's the logic of giving weapons to the Syrian terrorists now, just about forcing the new leader to get involved?Oh, yeah....there is none. Unless it's our goal to put the MidEast in flames.

Read the post.
It says the decision was made before the election.
I am hoping he reverses it.

Sounds like “the decision” to do it was made public after the election.
Politicking... remember, polyticks? Meaning many bloodsuckers.
Think about it though, Iran, seems to me, would have more of an interest in what is happening in a country they are that close to. What interest do we have except for some politician to score points on the nightly news?
If the election proves anything, it is that the Iranians as a people are not as bloodthirsty and warlike as many seem to offer over and over and over again.
They’re not screaming for Israeli blood. In fact for a while, it’s been the other way around.

The Bible predicts Syria will align with Egypt to attack the anti-christ in the tribulation
so, I think Iran needs to send 4000 caskets with their troops
Al Qaeda will win this one and they will prepare for war with Israel

This has the potential to turn into the Vietnam of the ME. We do not want to stare down Putin over Syria - he is working to rebuild Russian influence. The rebels have pledged allegiance to Al Queda, and this is the group that we arm?!?! Whiskey Tango Foxtrot!

do not fool yourself about anyone who is allowed to lead in Iran
Khamenie also ruled during the time of slaughter under Khomenie, and NO ONE rules without his say-so
there is no such thing as a moderate Imam-sponsored candidate

From February of 2012:
http://rt.com/news/syria-iran-cooperation-protests-969/
...The Syrian opposition announced earlier that commander of Irans elite Quds Force, Qassem Suleimani, advises the Syrian authorities on quashing the countrys opposition movement, the Telegraph newspaper reports.
According to the Israeli daily Haaretz, the Quds Force includes 15,000 elite soldiers, who operated in Iraq and other wars on foreign soil. The Quds is reportedly in charge of training and funding Hezbollah...
From May of 2012:
http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4234608,00.html
Iran confirmed Sunday that it has, as previously speculated, sent troops to aid President Bashar Assad’s crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in his country...

Practically all of the world’s geopolitical problems either originate with, or are exacerbated by, our evil, low-IQ, incompetent, sociopathic poseur of a “president.”

How will they get to Syria? Iran has no common border with Syria. They will either have to:
1. Drive through Northern Iraq (Iraq wouldn’t allow it)
2. Fly over Iraq (I doubt/hope Iraq wouldn’t allow that)
3. Sail through the Suez Canal (Egypt may not allow it and if they did Israel would be able to take the out as they will be bottle necked)

2. Fly over Iraq (I doubt/hope Iraq wouldnt allow that)
They’ve been flying arms across Iraq for a while now. I imagine this is the likely method of deployment Iran will use.

It would be nice to see it happen. I have met with a lot of people from Iran. Those who have a Persian background are smart, cultural, hard working, cool headed. The Arabs are a different matter.
