Why France�s gay marriage debate has started to look like a revolution
The Spectator (UK) ^

Posted on 04/28/2013 11:12:06 PM PDT by Olog-hai
Revolutions are often sparked by an unexpected shock to an already-weakened regime. As commentators in France remark not only on the crisis engulfing François Hollandes government but also on the apparent death rattle of the countrys entire political system, it could be that his flagship policy of legalizing gay marriageor rather, the gigantic public reaction against it, unique in Europewill be the last straw that breaks the Fifth Republics back.  (T)he deeper explanation for the strength of feeling lies in the fact that, in French law, marriage is indissociable from the right to start a family. There is currently no gay adoption in France and no access for gays or lesbians to medically-assisted procreation. These have been legalized to general indifference in Britain, but they are regarded as unacceptable by many in France and as an intolerable attack on the rights of the child. The marches against gay marriage are therefore really marches in favor of the traditional familyand in favor of that normality that Hollande promised to bring to the presidency, but which he has betrayed in favor of the interests of a tiny minority.

France, like the rest of Europe and much of the industrial world, is governed by one single political superclass which straddles not only nation-states but also left and right. Yup.

Can you blame them?
Why should 2% of the population be able to FORCE the other 98% to change the things they believe in and the way they do things?
Why exactly?

Perhaps the Eldest Daughter of the Church is slowly awakening and may be preparing to repent - I pray so.
Regrettably, like most of the European Church, it has been served by weak or even subversive bishops.

France has its socialist and libertarian factions, but there’s always been a Catholic one often suppressed by civil authorities who insist on a “secular state.”

Funny how the Obama buttlicking media (who for YEARS extolled the virtues of French culture) aren’t COVERING the apparent anger in that nation over the forced celebration of sodomy.
I pray for a spiritual revival in France, though...her people are lost without Christ.

Found dissociable in the Oxford English dictionary.
1. The reverse of sociable, unsociable
2. That tends to separate

If the Fifth Republic falls, will Madame Guillotine make a come back? Perhaps President Hollande and his Muslim friends need to make her acquaintance. It is difficult to understand why the French elected this awful socialist Hollande over Sarkozy. But, it is the French way. Americans were stupid enough to give Barry Obonzo four more years to destroy the country, so why not the French voters giving Hollande seven years to destroy France?

With Putin in Russia and the French citizens showing much more moral backbone than the sheeple in the USA, we will deserve the disaster that will come to America as a result of the Left’s attack on the traditional family.

An interest form of conservatism. They have long had the right to wives, mistresses and female lovers - but, by God, no man on the side. Or it is the Catholic ethos in a weakened form - as long as the sex could theoretically be procreative, it is moral.

Sad indeed.
The day is soon coming when John Roberts and/or Anthony Kennedy will impose fag “marriage” on the entire US.
My fear is that there will be nary a whimper in this once great country when it happens.

Why would there be. The left openly pushes for it and the right is tripping over themselves to vote for whatever leftist the GOP runs.
That’s the reality. Too few of us left that care.And people that say I’m too negative need to disprove the above with facts or admit the truth of it.

The French are a bunch of prissy prima donas, until they decide to stop being so. Then they get rather, shall we say, effective at solving the problem.

I imagine the numbers are changing a bit, seeing how we are taking money from parents to pay for a homosexual agenda in the schools. Homosexuality has strong roots in child abuse.
the religion of lust minces on.

Doing it here also. With the help of 50% of the public. Saw an article that said 76% of American Jews APPROVE of gay marriage!! 76% of God’s chosen people. And, people wonder why He dispersed them in 135 AD. Unbelief. Unfaithfulness. Seems they just never learn. None of us ever learn it seems. Only few true believers seem to get it. The remnant of Israel and the remnant Church.

Well, there are more than just the Jews that were chosen by God (remember the lost ten Israelite tribes, and of course Levi and Benjamin who are considered Jews nowadays from being part of the Kingdom of Judah); but for 76 percent of the tribe of Judah in the USA (the tribe from whence David and Jesus were born) to be so liberal is quite shameful.

I’ve long observed that non-Israeli Jews, in general, seem to have a curious death wish. They tend to support pretty much whatever cause will bring about their destruction.

In Matthew it is clear than 2/3ds of Jews will die in the Tribulation. That only about 1/3rd will survive. Those are the ones that flee to the mountains (to Petra, Jordan is what many scholars believe). That 1/3rd will probably come from orthodox Jews, who have belief in at least the Old Testament. Secular and atheist Jews will probably be the majority of that 2/3rds who perish. Since Israel has more Jews now than even America, then I suspect that the majority of those in America will be in the 2/3rds that perish. The poll said that only 18% disapproved. I suspect those are mostly orthodox.
