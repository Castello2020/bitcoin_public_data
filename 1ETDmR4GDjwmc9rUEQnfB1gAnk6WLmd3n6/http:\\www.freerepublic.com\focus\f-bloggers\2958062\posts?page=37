    <p>I will take her advice when she takes down her recommendation to &#8220;not file tax returns&#8221; from her web page.</p>
<p>That advice, if taken, will cause folks to lose EVERYTHING to the govt and feed the beast rather than starve it.</p>
<p>I also take issue with her assertion in the posted list here that currency is &#8220;fiat currency&#8221;.</p>
<p>This feeds the reader into another tenet of the tax protester movement that is also a trap.</p>

    <p>OK what about her website recommendation to not file tax return forms?</p>
<p>Its in the page where she lists things to do, such as &#8220;take the money out of your bank accounts&#8221;.</p>
<p>Not filing the returns is the ONE thing that is GUARANTEED to cause problems, and undo all the things that the person who viewed the videos put into place in order to survive.</p>

    <p>Here&#8217;s the article where she advocates not filing :</p>
<p>YOU READY TO GET SERIOUS NOW? YOU READY TO LISTEN? POSTED BY ANN BARNHARDT - NOVEMBER 7, AD 2012 6:23 PM MST</p>
<p>Now do you understand why I had precious little to say about the &#8220;election&#8221;? The results of this election were determined in 2008, including the faux-opposition candidate. You people who have spent the last several months breathlessly agonizing over this, analyzing fake polls and deluding yourselves into believing that this was somehow a legitimate operation are just sad. You&#8217;re like the people in Iraq who supported the opposition candidate to Saddam Hussein for all of those years. Yes, Saddam Hussein held &#8220;elections&#8221;. Regularly. That is what happened here yesterday. We had a Saddam Hussein &#8220;election&#8221;.</p>
<p>This can all be summed up in one simple sentence that I have been screaming from the rooftops ever since November of 2008:</p>
<p>These people are NEVER going to walk away.</p>
<p>The Republic was overthrown in a neo-Stalinist putsch four years ago. Stalinists don&#8217;t walk away. Ever. Stalinists don&#8217;t hold elections - they put on shows to delude the masses, which they consider to be vermin, into believing that they still have some say and some degree of freedom. And when even that gets tiresome for them, they start slaughtering people. By the tens of millions.</p>
<p>Note that all of the so-called pundits on the so-called &#8220;right&#8221; are avoiding the issue of massive voter fraud. They&#8217;re all just spewing the same nonsense as ever:</p>
<p>The fight has just begun! This is when the real hard work begins! Yay! We&#8217;ll show &#8216;em in 2016! Yay!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here in the land of reality, my inbox is filling with emails from people who are just now realizing that they are probably going to die an unnatural death, and probably within the next several years.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s cool, because Ace put up a recipe thread today. Spit on one&#8217;s hands and hoist the black flag, indeed!</p>
<p>So, what to do now? I have several action items for you. These are all re-hash, but I&#8217;ll put them together and re-post them because maybe, just maybe, you people are actually ready to listen and do something.</p>
<p>1. TAX STRIKE</p>
<p>If you are self-employed, stop paying quarterlies and DO NOT FILE next April. Boehner rolled over this morning and announced that the &#8220;Republicans&#8221; are gung-ho to raise taxes. They can only raise taxes on you if you pay taxes. Don&#8217;t pay. DO NOT FILE.</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE NOT SELF-EMPLOYED and your employer withholds your taxes, all you have to do is increase THE NUMBER OF EXEMPTIONS YOU CLAIM. Exemptions are NOT just wife-and-kids. People who make large charitable donations kick up their exemptions, as do people with big mortgages. In theory, there is no maximum to the number of exemptions you can claim, but 9 is considered to be the &#8220;normal&#8221; maximum. Go to your human resources / payroll department tomorrow and tell them you want to increase your exemptions and thus decrease your withholding as much as possible. Then, next April, DO NOT FILE.</p>
<p>There is exactly ONE non-violent remedy left to you, and that is a tax strike. If you do not do this, you are guaranteeing, and I mean 1000% guaranteeing, that there will be a massive hot war and genocide in the United States within the next decade. Go find a good teenaged boy. Look into his eyes, and then understand that if we do not starve the Putsch Regime in Washington, that boy will almost certainly die in the war.</p>
<p>2. MEDIA STRIKE</p>
<p>If you do not now understand that the media is enemy number one of you, your family, this culture and of God; if you do not understand that the media is SATANIC, then you are either terminally stupid or you are hopelessly addicted to the satanic filth, agitporn and lies yourself. Pick up the phone, call the cable or satellite company and TURN THE SHIT OFF NOW.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, I found out how much you are paying for each cable channel. It is roughly $0.12 per month per channel. I saw this figure in a recent story about Algore&#8217;s Stalinist propaganda channel, Current TV, which they are now trying to sell. Current TV goes into 60 million homes and has annual revenues from their cable and satellite royalties of $86 million. That is $0.12 per subscriber per month. So, you are offering that &#8220;pinch of incense&#8221; of $0.12 per month (at minimum) for every channel that is included in your cable or satellite package, including the sodomite channel, including MTV, including MSNBC, whether you watch it or not, and even if you block it on your cable box. Your money is still going to these outfits every month, and in doing so you proclaim that &#8220;caesar is lord&#8221;. St. Polycarp, pray for us.</p>
<p>3. FINANCIAL MARKET STRIKE</p>
<p>Get out, get out, get out. Close every brokerage account without exception. When my economic presentation is posted within the next few days, you will clearly see why. Pull your bank accounts down to the bare minimum. Buy gold and silver. Keep some Federal Reserve Notes on hand. Pay off debt and hold clear title to as much as you possibly can. Start liquidating your stuff now if, like me, you are going to eventually lose your home, which should actually be in play for almost everyone except the very wealthy who don&#8217;t need to generate any income (and thus pay no taxes) to survive and and simply live off of their existing wealth. Anyone who generates income and declares a tax strike should start preparing now to have their home and the contents of their home seized. Thus, get rid of everything now so that there is nothing for them to seize.</p>
<p>4. CANCEL YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE</p>
<p>Find cash-only doctors (general practitioners) operating in your area and establish a relationship with them now. Once you find a cash-only G.P., get a list of cash-only surgeons and surgery centers.</p>
<p>If you live anywhere near Oklahoma City, there is already an outstanding cash-only surgery center in your back yard. CLICK HERE TO BEHOLD THE FUTURE OF MEDICINE.</p>
<p>5. START THINKING AGGRESSIVELY AND OFFENSIVELY</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll just give you an example so you know what I mean. I found out that when you don&#8217;t file with the IRS, what they do is &#8220;subpoena&#8221; your bank statements from your bank, and then they simply go in and add up all of the credits in your bank account and IGNORE ALL OF THE DEBITS. No expenses are recognized whatsoever. Every dollar &#8220;in&#8221; is considered to be pure, fully-taxable income.</p>
<p>Sounds horrible, right? Especially if you are a business owner like me, right?</p>
<p>So, how do I make this work for me? Simple. I&#8217;m going to get some cash deposited into the bank in a quantity that I am prepared to lose, and then I am going to login to my online banking interface and sit here all blessed day and transfer that quantity of money between my bank accounts. I&#8217;m hoping to &#8220;generate&#8221; &#8220;income&#8221; in the form of credit entries on my bank statements into the eight figures.</p>
<p>In theory, if I had enough of a cash base, I could literally offset the entire national debt by &#8220;generating income&#8221; for the IRS in this way. But, I&#8217;ll just target an eight-figure &#8220;taxable&#8221; income for 2012. Heh. See what I&#8217;m getting at here? You don&#8217;t cower. You RUN AT THEM.</p>
<p>If those rat bastards want to play, I&#8217;m their huckleberry.</p>
<p>Say when.</p>

    <i>OK what about her website recommendation to not file tax return forms?</i><p> What about it? Me, I&#39;m not going to follow that recommendation! <p> That doesn&#39;t keep me from hearing what she has to say and her reasoning behind it. I&#39;m sure there a lots of things that Ann and I disagree on but, I learned the real meaning of &#39;Fiat&#39;. Do you know what the word means? Watch just the first video and you will... <p> It&#39;s a rare individual that you don&#39;t learn at least a little something from. And Ann is full of knowledge about what&#39;s going on today in the financial world today and what&#39;s likely headed our way very soon. That bit of information might save you a bunch of heartache not far down the road.

    <i>I will take her advice when she takes down her recommendation to &#147;not file tax returns&#148; from her web page.</i><p> It is now a mathematical certainty that the US dollar is going to collapse. It has been naked short-sold into nothingness by forcing banks to make loans that will never be paid back, forcing the banks to not mark the loans down to actual value (fraud), and encouraging them to &quot;bundle&quot; those worthless loans into &quot;securities&quot; sold on the open market to unsuspecting chumps. <p> You&#39;re going to lose everything one way or another anyway.

    <p>COSTELLO: I want to talk about the unemployment rate in America.<br />
ABBOTT: Good Subject. Terrible Times. It&#8217;s 7.8%.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: That many people are out of work?<br />
ABBOTT: No, that&#8217;s 14.7%.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: You just said 7.8%.<br />
ABBOTT: 7.8% Unemployed.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Right 7.8% out of work.<br />
ABBOTT: No, that&#8217;s 14.7%.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Okay, so it&#8217;s 14.7% unemployed.<br />
ABBOTT: No, that&#8217;s 7.8%.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: WAIT A MINUTE. Is it 7.8% or14.7%?<br />
ABBOTT: 7.8% are unemployed. 14.7% are out of work.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: IF you are out of work you are unemployed.<br />
ABBOTT: No, Obama said you can&#8217;t count the &#8220;Out of Work&#8221; as the unemployed.<br />
You have to look for work to be unemployed.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: BUT THEY ARE OUT OF WORK!!!<br />
ABBOTT: No, you miss his point.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: What point?<br />
ABBOTT: Someone who doesn&#8217;t look for work can&#8217;t be counted with those who<br />
look for work. It wouldn&#8217;t be fair.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: To whom?<br />
ABBOTT: The unemployed.<br />
COSTELLO: But they are ALL out of work.<br />
ABBOTT: No, the unemployed are actively looking for work. Those who are out<br />
of work gave up looking and if you give up, you are no longer in the ranks<br />
of the unemployed.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: So if you&#8217;re off the unemployment roles that would count as less<br />
unemployment?<br />
ABBOTT: Unemployment would go down. Absolutely!</p>
<p>COSTELLO: The unemployment just goes down because you don&#8217;t look for work?<br />
ABBOTT: Absolutely it goes down. That&#8217;s how Obama gets it to 7.8%. Otherwise<br />
it would be 14.7%. He doesn&#8217;t want you to read about 14.7% unemployment.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: That would be tough on his reelection.<br />
ABBOTT: Absolutely.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Wait, I got a question for you. That means there are two ways to<br />
bring down the unemployment number?<br />
ABBOTT: Two ways is correct.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Unemployment can go down if someone gets a job?<br />
ABBOTT: Correct.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: And unemployment can also go down if you stop looking for a job?<br />
ABBOTT: Bingo.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: So there are two ways to bring unemployment down, and the easier<br />
of the two is to have Obama&#8217;s supporters stop looking for work.<br />
ABBOTT: Now you&#8217;re thinking like the Obama Economy Czar.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: I don&#8217;t even know what the hell I just said!<br />
ABBOTT: Now you&#8217;re thinking like Obama.</p>

    Here&#39;s a preview of her insight; I can recognize one of the topics in her index from her previous writings (this is not an exact quote). I&#39;m looking forward to seeing the videos. <p><i>We look at gold as the fallback for completely adulterated fiat currencies. But in corrupt regimes historically, precious metals were just as easy to adulterate as fiat paper. The actual issue is counterparty risk.

    It&#39;s possible that Ann might find protection under the 14th Amendment.<p> You could argue that passage of the 16th required of citizens the same responsibly required of the states and federal government payees and therefore inherent within the following clause of the 14th Amendment, par. 4,:<p><i>But neither the United States nor any State <b>[i.e. nor any Citizen]</b> shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States...</i><p> An honest jury may find that indeed any knowledgeable or alert person by reason would think that indeed insurrection or rebellion is exactly what is being covertly-perpetrated by this administration. <p> Would you yourself deny our constitution and way of life appears to be under attack, or that we are intentionally being bankrupt? <p> Ever hear of the Cloward and Piven strategy or Alinsky? I know I would and so would thousands of other patriots.

    I&#39;ve been advocating repeal of the 16th by way of a state sponsored constitutional convention for that sole purpose. And to do it while we still have enough red states to pull it off. Few agree and most are too scare to even think about trying.<p> What&#39;s going to happen is the government will continue to demand more and more from the people. Where/If people draw a line and actually fight back, depends upon where their fortitude intersects their belief that they have nothing left to lose.<p> In the last video, Ann explains that she knows examples will have to be made and she accepts her fate in playing that role. Others will follow, she believes. The government isn&#39;t going to stop taking until they meet resistance from the people rising up and stopping them.<p> They&#146;re going to play this insidiously, all the time dividing and pitting one class against another. In the end however, it always winds up with millions impoverish, jailed and eventually murdered and enslaved by their own government.<p> At some point while we were all asleep, the bus crossed the Rubicon&#133;

    <i>Does state = citizen in the eyes of the law.</i><p> Then perhaps the state needs to rise to the occasion and become the intermediary and do its job as outlined in the US Constitution. It should immediately restrict its citizen Ann and ALL of its citizens from contributing to the out of control federal waste and fraud the this administration is engaged in. <p> Make a legislative decree signed by the governor. The other red states should follow. In fact, we ought to be demanding this of all state representatives as our part in helping to reign in this out of control federal monster.<p> Don&#39;t you think a once brave and free people should at least make a fuss, before bowing to Obama and his minions? If not for ourselves, then in honor of those who gave everything to preserve this nation and our way of life.

    <p>Re-watching Part 1. HOORAY Ann! Money!</p>
<p>&#8220;Watch money. Money is the barometer of a society&#8217;s virtue. When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsion &#150; when you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing &#150; when you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors &#150; when you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws don&#8217;t protect you against them, but protect them against you &#150; when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice &#150; you may know that your society is doomed.&#8221; - Rand</p>

    <p>You didn&#8217;t miss it, Errant. It was Francisco&#8217;s &#8220;Money&#8221; Speech in Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. It fits in nicely with Ann&#8217;s Part 1 Money. In her laters &#8220;Parts&#8221; she refers to Atlas Shrugged and going Galt.</p>

    Ok, thanks! I&#39;m still going to review parts of Ann&#39;s presentation to lock in some of the key points she made.<p> One I found especially interesting was her idea of money being tied to the value of human labor. That is deserving of more thought, IMO.<p> Ayn Rand&#39;s future insights are amazing!

    <p>The 8 part presentation is awesome. This is one brave lady!</p>
<p>And it doesn&#8217;t hurt one bit that she&#8217;s a looker, too!</p>
<p>She is totally correct about a couple things that I have thought of in the past.</p>
<p>1) The average American with their 30 second Twitter attention span has ZERO chance of understanding it<br />
2) The debt is unserviceable. It has grown so large that the printing presses need to run, in overtime, forever, just to keep things going and avoid an obvious default.<br />
3) The whole question of money isn&#8217;t really about paper or gold or silver. It is about sweat. It is a moral issue, an issue of trust, and honesty, and discipline.</p>
<p>This is an awesome video series and I highly recommend people watch it. It can only end one way. With all the 401(K)&#8217;s, pension funds, money market accounts, etc, etc, etc going to the big ZERO!</p>
