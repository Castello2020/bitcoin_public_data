I wonder if the lack of interest has any connection of a dwindling Anglo population and massive infiltration of immigrants wanting to destroy the Anglo traditions?Look for the same for the DOI and the Constitution at nation near you.

Conservatives must note and learn that it was a conflict between the elites that gave us the Magna Carta as well as the US Constitution. The people had and always will have little to do with it.
