<p>Harvard students, outraged over a doctoral dissertation arguing that Hispanic immigrants lack &#147;raw cognitive ability or intelligence,&#148; this week urged the university to investigate how the thesis came to be approved and to ban future research on racial superiority. <p>The students presented 1,200 signatures to president Drew Faust and the dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government, David Ellwood. <p>&#147;Academic freedom and a reasoned debate are essential to our academic community,&#148; the petition said. &#147;However, the Harvard Kennedy School cannot ethically stand behind academic work advocating a national policy of exclusion and advancing an agenda of discrimination.&#148; &#133;<br clear="all" /></p>

    <p>All Richwine&#8217;s critics have to do is show the statistical evidence that proves Richwine wrong. No critic has been able to do that because the statistical evidence supports Richwine&#8217;s conclusions. Sadly, political correctness has prevailed and uncomfortable truths are seldom spoken in public because the speaker knows he will be maligned, attacked, and will lose his job and reputation. Speaking uncomfortable truths, particularly with regard to race, leads to 21st century Witch Trials where the gallery who supposedly knows the truth attempts to exorcise the demons from the non-PC speaker.</p>

    I&#39;ve heard it said.more than a few times,that there&#39;s scientific evidence to suggest that Jews,in general,are intellectually superior to most racial/ethnic groups.My former girlfriend,a Radcliffe grad,had a friend who worked in Harvard&#39;s admissions office who told her that were it not for affirmative action the freshman classes at Harvard would be made up almost entirely of Jews and Asians.<p> You&#39;ve just gotta love affirmative action.The only people who really benefit are the guilt ridden &quot;progressives&quot; whose consciences are assuaged by the justice of it all.<p> Funny how Ted Kennedy never gave up his seat to a half black,half Hispanic,half Pacific Islander lesbian however.

I got him really pissed-off when I claimed that Spain became a 3rd-rate nation when they expelled the Jews in the 15th-century, as they ended up kicking out all the smartest people running things in Spain, and Spain never recovered. But it&#39;s true; everywhere the Jews settle, the host nation benefits from the Jews intelligence.<p> So with an influx (or deluge) of latin immigrants into the U.S.A., are we seeing an improvement or a decline in smartness?

    <p>This is insane. But a logical outcome of multiculturalism. The fact is that the Mexican culture placed less stress on intellectual work than the Chinese or the Jewish. The black culture has the same outcomes, just as the white redneck culture that it mimics. But even genetically, ethnic groups are not all equal in their endowments. One only has to look at the NBA to see that blacks have a physical advantage in terms of height and speed. Some races and some cultures ARE superior&#8212;relative to a type of performance. That can change.</p>

    <p>Regarding Spain, they did not kick out all the Jews.For more than a hundred years Jews had been converting to Christianity, and these Jews did not go away. Many Spaniards had Jewish ancestors, including that very bight light, Teresa of Avila. Ironically the Inquisition, which began to ferret out secret Jews and of course to liberate them of their wealth for the Crown, gradually became an agency that enabled noble family to bury their Jewish pasts, by obtaining certificates of purity. As for its decline, well, having imbeciles on the throne for sixty years will help do that. And of course, the Hapsburgs were always less attentive to Spain than to their imperial interests. This did contribute to the stopping of the Turkish advance in the Med and of course the Austrian branch began the roll-back of the Ottomans in the Balkans.</p>

    I haven&#39;t researched or studied this subject at all, but it reasonable to assume that various groups have differing strengths and weaknesses based on genetics. The Scots were not known for their ferocity in battle for no reason, Germans definitely have the tendency to go to extremes, Africans tend to be more athletic, and so on and so forth. Different genetic pools will of course come with different types of abilities. <p>That doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t exceptions, many exceptions to the rule, and these days with so many races mingled freely (as opposed to past when birds of a feather always flocked together), its safe to assume that the rules that applied in the past are largely defunct. <p>But trends can still remain, especially in places where there is less mingling among differing genetic groups.

That doesn&#39;t mean a group must be &quot;inferior&quot; in some ways and &quot;superior&quot; in others, because the differences are by all appearances slight and ignorable, and an individuals <i>measureable</i> capacity to achieve isn&#39;t going to be determined by race. Individual applied effort is the great equalizer in any event.

    <p>I must admit I should have read more closely the leading sentence in the article. I relied too much on the title (mistake).</p>
<p>&#8220;Harvard students, outraged over a doctoral dissertation arguing that Hispanic immigrants lack &#147;raw cognitive ability or intelligence,&#148; this week urged the university to investigate how the thesis came to be approved and to ban future research on racial superiority.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>It states that &#8220;Harvard students&#8221; were outraged.</p>
<p>That should have been an alarm bell. (and I am not prejudice about Harvard graduates, my son-in-law is a Harvard Law Graduate &amp; is 1/2 Hispanic, the quickest study I have ever met and a stanch Republican.)</p>

    <p>It may be fact that statistically the illegal immigrants that come to the US are not high achievers.</p>
<p>But Hispanics in general is a very broad category. Some have heavy Indian blood lines, some have Spanish (as in Spain) blood lines and others like Cuba are a mixture.</p>
<p>My issue with the illegal immigrants is their &#8220;culture&#8221;. My observation is that most of them do not think that Capitalism can give them opportunity to succeed and that government is their friend. The Mexican Government is totally corrupt politically. (I am reluctant to throw stones at them since we have Obozo) That corruption and an oppressive history of the elitists there are a breeding ground for Leftism. It will be a very hard education process to overcome this.</p>
<p>I spent 14 years in NM in a mine union district that was 51% Hispanic. I saw up close and personal the Leftist element at the local university. I was GOP County Chairman there are several years. Yes, we did have Conservative Hispanic member then (early to mid 1980&#8217;s)</p>

    <p>My opinion is that it is more a cultural issue caused by the corrupt Mexican government and economic system than it is an IQ thing.</p>
<p>The illegal immigrants from Mexico generally have no confidence in Capitalism providing them opportunity and fairness. They are conditioned to look to government to provide those things. Very hard sell to overcome that.</p>
<p>Many of the new immigrants are very hard working, family oriented and were religious conservatives (that is changing with the new generation). Most all of them are Catholic, and like the term Hispanic, is a very broad category. Some are very very conservative (we have those here) others are far left of center politically.</p>

    <p>If the Harvard crew would bring some substantive objections, like research falsification or sloppy research, inability to replicate his findings, failure to follow scientific methodology, well, that would be one thing.</p>
<p>But these charges of discrimination, &#8216;insensitivity&#8217;&#8212;or as they might say: &#8216;whatever&#8217;&#8212;are as bogus as their attempts, for example, to carry water for Michael Bellisiles and his fabrication &#8216;Arming America&#8217; about ten years ago.</p>
<p>They approve or disapprove of any proposition depending upon whether it serves their political agenda. Period.<br />
Hopefully not being too blunt, IMHO these kids and their perfessors can either attempt to do what was done then, or go s*** in their mortar-boards.</p>

    <p>&#8220;My former girlfriend,a Radcliffe grad,had a friend who worked in Harvard&#8217;s admissions office who told her that were it not for affirmative action the freshman classes at Harvard would be made up almost entirely of Jews and Asians.&#8221;</p>
<p>I believe that is slightly wrong. At Stanford, they basically put up a academic bar (like high jumping) of purely academic criteria. Clear the bar and you are in the pool of applicants. After that it is recomendations, extra curriculars, diversity, sports, leadership, music, alumni connections, do your parents donate and how much, are you popular in school, are you attractive, what race and sex, what part of the country do you come from, etc.</p>
<p>So basically at Stanford, if it were not for AA there would be a lot of jews, asians and whites (while on pure academics the whites are behind, the other factors and pure numbers mean a lot of whites clear the academic bar and are in the pool) with a smattering of blacks and hispanics.</p>
<p>With AA, the only change is there is probably twice the number of blacks and hispanics.</p>
<p>I suspect the similar thing happens at Harvard.</p>

&#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is an obfuscation. Mexicans aren&#8217;t Cubans and aren&#8217;t Argentines and aren&#8217;t Spaniards. And &#8220;our&#8221; Mexicans aren&#8217;t representative of the general Mexican population for that matter.</p>

    <i>Yes remember Ted is Hispanic (Cuban). And he had top academic record (B.A.) Princeton University &amp; (J.D.)

He thinks that he is no special person and that if he can succeed, anyone can succeed. In that respect, I think he is delusional. I&#39;ve seen the 1 percenters and I&#39;ve seen the bottom 50 percenters. Almost no one in the bottom 50% will ever achieve anything like what Cruz has done, no matter what you do. It is just like I will never be an Olympic track star no matter what I do. It just is not there.
