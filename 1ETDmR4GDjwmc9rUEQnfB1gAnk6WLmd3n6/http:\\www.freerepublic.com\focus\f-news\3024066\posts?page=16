FULL TITLE: Napalm bomb and five other devices found under bedroom floorboards of Oregon student, 17, 'who wanted to blow up high school and outdo Columbine massacre' An Oregon teenager is accused of meticulously plotting to blow up his high school in an attack 'forged and inspired by' the Columbine shootings. Grant Acord, 17, was arrested on Thursday night after police received a tip that he was making a bomb to blow up West Albany High School. On Saturday, investigators found six explosives hidden under floorboards at his mother's house. The weapons included pipe bombs, Molotov cocktails, a Drano bomb, a napalm bomb and explosives made from drain cleaner. He also had 'plans checklists, diagrams, inspirations, sources and a focus on recreating the model of Columbine, with adjustments that would make it more successful,' according to Benton County District Attorney John Haroldson. The 1999 massacre in Littleton, Colorado, which was carried out by two Columbine High School seniors, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, left 13 dead and 21 others wounded. 'This was a very methodical process,' Haroldson said. 'He took time to even get to this point.' Police have not yet pinpointed a motive for the plot. Haroldson said he wasn't aware that the teen was having trouble at school, or being bullied. He was described as quiet and a loner by other students, though one student said he seemed like 'a pretty nice guy.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Two psychiatrists are waling along. They see a man who has been badly beaten lying in a ditch. One psychiatrist says, “We need to find the man who did this. He needs help.”

How did this guy learn to jellify fuel?
If he was that smart he should have been a top student there.

Obvious solution is to post some no napalm, drain cleaner and pipe bomb signs.That reminds me how I lost a coworker friend. We were driving in my car, passing a school and a sign like the one below. I told him "This is where you can score some dope". He look at me and said nothing for the rest of our long trip. From then on I knew he was a moonbat. 16

That’s dangerous territory comrade. Posting “No Bombs” signs might be offensive to those immigrants whose cultures use bombs as their free expression of speech and religion.
Let’s just stick keeping guns away from white people, OK?

The government schools are nothing but impersonal warehouses/day care centers, stripped of any morality or sense of community, where a Lord-of-the-Flies type of social organization reigns. Kids can be incredibly cruel to each other, whether through direct harassment or cold indifference, and adults no longer provide, or are allowed to provide, moral structure. Most kids get through it, but the level of stress can be such that the odd 1 in a thousand or so wants to lash out in a big way. School is just supposed to be a place of learning, but it ends up being raw social darwinism. Government schools are child abuse.

LOL! Those moonbats are so streetwise.
When I was in college, my friend and I were talking with my parents and some if their friends, when the topic of drugs came up. I said, if you want drugs, just go down to the high school. My friend gave me a “duh!” look.
But my dad’s friend’s jaw-dropped. She couldn’t believe it. I thought, “Really?”
****
True story. A NH cop told me that once a year the do a drug sweep of the high school in his town. But two days ahead of time the chief notifies the Super. The HS principal then announces the upcoming sweep.
They never found any drugs.

It points to the moonbats’ belief in governmental solutions, and humourlessness. Put up a sign and the problem disappears.

napalmI rather suspect it was more like what is fondly known as a "molotov cocktail." It is as with dogs, I think. If the police shoot a "menacing" dog it was a Pit Bull even if it was disguised as an Irish Setter.

In Texas, if you’re in sports or band, you’re subject to a random drug test every six weeks. IOW, the kids who are social and involved with school activities, you are considered guilty until proven innocent. If you’re in the group who smokes dope and deals behind the shop building and shuns school activites, you don’t have to worry about being tested.

25 years ago a movie called Heathers with ChristianSlater and Winona Ryder explored teen angst, bullying, and revenge.it ended with Ryder stopping Slater from blowing up theHS gym during a school assembly. I was described as black comedy by Siskel and Ebert who gave it two thumbs way up.I thought the reaction was nuts and this movie could drive some bullied depressed kid over the edge.I often wondered how many of these teen mass killers have watched Heathers.

He must have not had enough attention so he figures if he kills some people the media give him all the attention he desires. He’ll be famous, the media makes sure of that.
Their name should not be used under any circumstances. I had never heard the name Jody Arias until the media n=made her famous!!

What kind of psychotropic drugs is this kid on.?
Is there a cure or does he need to be put away for life?
If it were up to me I would take all of his stuff out in the desert, pile it up, sit him on top of it and see if it works.

I think that by cynically mocking the “Drug Free Zone” sign, I attacked one of the moonbats’ basic tenets of faith, and that is that government is good and does well intentioned things. I base this on the following exchanges with this guy, who at that point was a new member of our team. Next, by the way, I told him that I’d never buy a GM car, only to learn later that his dad was an exec at that very corporation. An auspicious beginning it wasn’t, and things between us didn’t proceed like (presumably ) those between Rick and Louie in Casablanca.

I try to be circumspect when the truth about a particular situation (not an aggregate) is unknown. It avoids looking like an ass, which can hurt my credibility and lessen the good that I can do.

Just type “how to make napalm”, there are many links on “how to”.
Wiki even has an article describing the three variations of US military napalm.
When I was young, some knowledgeable vet described how they made it when he was in Vietnam. As an early teen it stuck in my memory. Never wanted to try making my own, as I found out real young not to mess with gas and flame. You get burned that way!!!!!!

Please don’t let anyone know that peanuts are dangerous. I own a franchise called “GoinPostal” where we ship through all carriers. If they ban peanuts we would have a heckuva time sending stuff. Don’t give the govt. new ideas. They come up with enough stoopid stuff on their own.

If you mix gasoline with Styrofoam you get a good approximation of napalm.
It is pretty easy to make
