Scientists Discover Evidence Of Dark Lightning

Though its name sounds better suited to fantasy or sci-fi, researchers have recently gathered evidence that something called dark lightning exists, the Washington Post reported. Like any evil twin, dark lightning appears to "compete" with the ordinary lightning during thunderstorms. A person could be struck by dark lightning and not even know it. Like ordinary lightning, dark lightning brews inside thunderclouds. In fact, it may be a competing way for the clouds to release their energy, says Joseph Dwyer, a lightning researcher at the Florida Institute of Technology. Dwyer has come up with a model explaining how dark lightning arises. His idea awaits further measurements for confirmation. Scientists first began seeing hints of dark lightning from gamma ray measurements from satellites since at least the 1990s, according to this NASA video. Gamma rays, the most energetic wave in the electromagnetic spectrum, are typically associated with radioactive decay, nuclear detonations and supernova explosions. Dark lightning appears to be made of X-rays and gamma rays. Although no one knows for sure, humans may have been struck by dark lightning before, most likely during an airplane ride, Dwyer told the Washington Post. Even that is unlikely: Pilots usually stay away from storms, and dark lightning flashes are rare compared to ordinary lightning bolts. If hit, however, plane passengers probably wouldn't hear or feel the strike, but they would absorb what Dwyer estimated to be an entire lifetime's worth of safe radiation. Dark Lightning Flash Above Earth In this visualization of dark lightning, which is actually invisible, gamma rays are shown in pink. Highlighted in yellow are subatomic particles called positrons that the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope detected from this dark lightning flash. The Earth is below and the moon appears behind the pink gamma rays. Screenshot from "ScienceCasts: Dark Lightning" by Science@NASA on YouTube

I feel sure that I am being struck by dark lighning at this very instance. Of course, I feel nothing at all -- but that doesn't mean I'm not being subjected to multiple bolts of the stuff. My only real question is that if this is safe radiation, what amount constitutes "an entire lifetime's worth"? Would absorbing 10,000 lifetimes' worth be a problem? Is there any actual meaning this type of language at all, or did it just sound good to the writer?

Dark lightning, dark matter, the God Particle......
Keep in mind, this is science that develops hypothesis based on “holes” in research. When things don’t add up, “something is missing.” What would explain the peice of the puzzle?
I’m not saying the science is not legit. It’s a start. But you’d think there would be more proof or evidence beyond an explanation or absence of proof. The extent of the explanation is somthing satalights have recorded.
Science continues to get more and more sloppy. I guess this tidbit will get them some more funding to find the “dark lightning”.

LOLNow well have to start putting lead shields on aircraft........ Well, that would certainly use more fuel. Burning more fuel would increase the rate of apocalyptic global warming. People might all have to move to an Island near Guam. Then the islands would start to tip over. But that's ok because wellfare and foodstamps helps the economy by giving people jobs. Wait!..... Would a plane still fly if it were completely clad in lead? (sarcasm....as if it isn't obvious)

I see a gigantic government grant in the offing.
We need a crash study on a phenomenon that you can’t see, can’t feel, does no damage.

The phrase was poorly written, but the idea is that the effect of radiation on the body is cumulative, and the “safe” level is one that is low enough for our cells to repair the damage. The most practical application is with the rules that apply to nuclear workers; if their total exposure reaches a certain level they are not allowed near any source of radiation. So the article is suggesting that the dose from a lightning strike is 10,000 times the “safe” level for a lifetime. I find this claim dubious because that kind of exposure would almost certainly cause symptoms of radiation sickness and would likely be fatal.

So much gloom and doom these days. Dark lightning, EMP, atomic North Korea, atomic Iran, Israel on the brink, will we survive? Is this another crisis to distract us while the government picks our pockets?

If it’s invisible that explains why its dark.

My only real question is that if this is safe radiation, what amount constitutes "an entire lifetime's worth"? If you are speaking of legal matters the Nuclear Regulatory Agency says this is safe for occupational exposure. 5 times your age minus 18 REM per year. So if you are 20 that would be 2 times 5 which would equal 10 REM (Rad Equivalent Man). Then the NRC defines the Lethal dose (LD) as: The dose of radiation expected to cause death to 50 percent of an exposed population within 30 days (LD 50/30). Typically, the LD 50/30 is in the range from 400 to 450 rem (4 to 5 sieverts) received over a very short period. So safe is probably somewhere in between.

Another discovery that that has been tossed around the innernuts for a while.
http://tristan.ethereal.net/humor/dark-suckers.html
snip>>
For years it has been believed that electric bulbs emitted light. However, recent information from Bell Labs has proven otherwise. Electric bulbs don’t emit light; they suck dark. Thus they now call these bulbs dark suckers. The dark sucker theory, according to a spokesman from the Labs, proves the existence of dark, that dark has mass heavier than that of light, and that dark is faster than light.

Yup... Stupid name for a very interesting phenomena. Though I think “White-lightning” is already taken ... :-) Just another excellent reason not to fly through, over or under a thunderstorm.

Does that mean that if you get old enough youre immune to radiation? Well the current theory is that children (those still in their growing years) are more sensitive to the effects of radiation. The theory is that cells are most sensitive to radiation during cell division. Growing children have more cells in the process of division. All living humans have cells that divide frequently such as the blood producing cells in the bone marrow. So no the old are still sensitive to radiation but less so than younger people.
