<div class="b2">The media has done so much harm to our freedoms by encouraging/allowing Obama&#146;s un American agenda to endure/ making it to where an out of control character successfully has protection by them. The media has made our government into a mockery as well. Rule of law, forget that now. Hold people accountable, not if you&#146;re a liberal democrat or far left winger. It&#146;s only about them and this stupid mindset/don&#146;t call the terrorists names/ blame America/ America bad/get more people onto the government handout/over tax the worker so they can waste the money in what The -IRS going after you or me because of our views/ free speech.<p> Many can see the Obama team is not for all of us. Don&#146;t you wonder why the so called journalists seem to be unpatriotic to their country. They must hate us on the opposite side as much as Obama does. Just no other way to explain why they have allowed him time and time again to overreach his authority. Obama has abused his power for a very long while. There has to be a place of judgment on them as well because they have covered up the lies. This entire situation with the IRS is scary. How anyone can allow him to get away with this is a travesty. What will stop the next president into allowing this type of abuse.<br clear="all"></div>

<div class="b2"><p>Didn&#8217;t sound like they were bailing out to me.Sounded more like crying,and this part about Victoria Nuland saying her higher ups were not happy with the talking points,that is a watering down of what she actually said,she said my buildings leadership is not happy,now these are so called reporters,you mean to tell me they are not now worried about Hillary? Saying higher ups could be anyone above her,building leadership is Hillary and they know it,these rats are pathetic,especially Donnelly,she has her knee pads on at all times for Obama.</p>
