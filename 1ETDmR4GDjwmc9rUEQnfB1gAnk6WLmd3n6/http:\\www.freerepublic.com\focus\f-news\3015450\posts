CDC report: Americans eating too much sugar
WHEC ^
Posted on 05/03/2013 12:45:41 PM PDT by djf
Americans are eating too much sugar according to a new report from the CDC which analyzed dietary data from thousands of adults. Federal nutrition policy recommends limiting sugars and solid fats to between five to 15-percent of our daily calorie intake. But between 2005 and 2010, Americans got 13-percent of their total calories from added sugar alone which contributes to obesity and displaces healthier foods with essential nutrients. The report found adults in their 20's and 30's, men, African-Americans and those with lower incomes consumed the highest amount of added sugars.

Well if they omit pop, candy and assorted junk from what people on welfare can buy they would cut the problem in half.

The human body can tolerate eating small amounts of sugar.
But easily digestible carbs and starches are relatively rare in the natural environment.
Rodents and yeast and bacteria are pretty effective at keeping those foods to a minimum in the wild.

The explosion in Type II diabetes coincides with increased use of high fructose corn syrup. That stuff is killing people.

How much sugar Americans are eating wouldn't be a problem if they'd start doing "the jobs Americans don't want to do". Still, I don't think we have anything to worry about. Nanny Bloomers from New Yawk is on the case.

Few people on no/low fat “diets” realize they’re eating a ton of sugar, because sugar has no fat.

How long will it take them to realize that it is not just the table sugar that lifts insulin levels - the carbs that they tout as being heart healthy (even though they’re refined and processed) are lifting insulin to astronomical levels as well. It’s not just the sucrose, knuckleheads! It’s everything that raises insulin!

To each his own and I’m not preaching here but I simply do not see a reason to drink soft drinks or those sugary, milky, gloppy coffee drinks Starbucks sells. I think if you drank more water, unsweetened tea or coffee, you’d get all the refreshment of soda without the sugar.
As long as I’m ranting I see no value in artificial sweeteners either. I think Franklin was right when he observed that nine out of ten deaths are suicides.

If it tastes good, it has sugar or fat in it.
Sugar free? Look at fat level/vice versa.
I'm getting hungry for something tasty now just from reading this thread...and it better be tasty.....

I think if you drank more water, unsweetened tea or coffee, youd get all the refreshment of soda without the sugar. The pronoun "you" makes it seem that you are not just confining these opinions to your own habits. Some people don't get soda refreshment out of water, tea and coffee.

Too much HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP. Sugar is fine.......
Not really. I agree that HFCS is slightly worse than sugar because it more quickly causes an increase of insulin and elevates blood sugar levels faster. But sugar does the same thing, only at a slightly slower rate. They're both bad for you (in more than small amounts).

Some people don't get soda refreshment out of water, tea and coffee. I stopped drinking soda pop a long time ago. I do not remember now why I did it but it has been a good 12 or 15 years since I had a Coke or anything like it. Now I find that just watching someone order Coke with their whiskey is revolting to me.d;^)
