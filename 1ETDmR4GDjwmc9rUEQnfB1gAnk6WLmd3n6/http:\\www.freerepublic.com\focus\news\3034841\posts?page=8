Senate border deal may clear way for bill, wave of illegal immigrants

The border security deal senators struck last week has cleared the way for the immigration bill to pass with the support of at least 11 Republicans who say the additional 20,000 Border Patrol agents and potentially 350 miles of new fencing make the bill palatable. The only problem, according to analysts on all sides of the issue, is that those steps are not likely to achieve much in the way of stemming another wave of illegal immigration. This is the crux of the border security fight, which has become the central issue in the battle to pass an immigration bill through the Senate, and will be the subject of a key test vote Monday: What kind of security measures will it take to convince Americans that the country is serious about preventing another wave of illegal immigration  and are those measures the right answer? Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who helped write the original bill and then negotiated the added border security, said it was a lock that more agents will stop the flow of illegal immigrants. Ive been working on this for almost a decade with Sen. [John] McCain. I can look anybody in the eye and tell them that if you put 20,000 Border Patrol agents on the border in addition to the 20,000 weve already got  thats one every 1,000 feet  that will work, Mr. Graham told colleagues on the Senate floor. If you build the fence, that all helps. So I dont need any more than just getting it in place.

Their goal is to eliminate the border altogether.

Border will not be secured until they decided they need to keep us locked in . AT that time they will have no problems giving them a shoot to kill order.
They can write what ever they want in that bill and it means not a darn thing when they decide to just ignore it like they have done in the past .
We have chosen worthless leaders with no moral compass , we can not expect anything different from them .

Besides ... I think the mechanisms are in place and operational to let them fly in and check into a motel under some refugee status.

Border will not be secured until they decided they need to keep us locked in. My guess is we will see the emigration numbers rise dramatically by this time next year. Immigration will drop off quickly as the idiots begin to realize how much of the US debt each new immigrant becomes responsible for.

You think that because you think this immigration thing is about legalizing a bunch of Mexicans.
It’s not . That is just what they want you to think it’s about . The Mexicans are the least of our worries and yes they would just go back home .
This isn’t about Mexicans , it’s about muslims , hoards of them that would get paid to come here .

Amnesty amounts to erasing the border for all intents and purposes.
It also legally recognizes a class of people who are NOT subject to the local laws. Whose whereabouts are unknown, whose background is unknown, whose intents are unknown, and whose allegiances are unknown.
The United States government continually proves that they are way, way, way more interested in knowing all they can find out about plain white guys who were born here, and they pretty much don’t give a rat’s rear about some faceless guy (MILLIONS of them) who just hopped, skipped, and jumped across the border.

But they`ve already found a loophole in that monstrosity of a bill allows the leftists to stop the fence if THEY deem it unnecessary.

You just gotta love that little piece of the sentence: “...and potentially 350 miles of new fencing...”
Yup! POTENTIALLY.
The Republicans are absolute fools when it comes to common sense. They were promised a complete fence last time and when Obama gave them a “wedgie” they simply bent over and let them do it. They forgot the phrase “fool me once, shame on you...fool me twice, shame on me.”
We will all be “sold down the river” when millions of illegals (criminals) get to have a free ride to violate our customs, laws, and the American way of life prior to the 1970’s.
The worst part of it is that once these millions get in, even more will come to wait for the next amnesty. It was clearly shown that that would happen when Reagan gave the first one. These millions showed up after that to await the next one....which is now here.
Our Democratic way of life will simply vanish when both houses and the Supreme Court are completely controlled by liberals and Democrats with no chance of ever having a representative government for those who believe in the Constitutional rights we once had.

You just gotta love that little piece of the sentence: ...and potentially 350 miles of new fencing...In 2006, when GWB was The Real American President, and congress was all pubbie, they passed a LAW, that authorized 700 MILES of double fence, but when nancy peelosi became the first cunning runt squeeker of the house, the demonRATS just refused to fund it's being built. Since then, they demonRATs have never allowed it's funding...and never will.

The Republicans are absolute fools when it comes to common senseYou still think that? Rubio, Ayotte, Flake, McCain etc etc lied to the voters and passed themselves off as constitutional conservatives in order to get elected. Before they even had time to unpack to begin this term, they were very clear that their alliance is to Cheap Labor.That's what it's all about. Increasing global profits, lowering the inconvenient expense of paying wages for a middle and upper middle class and concentrating global wealth to the elite. Our only chance is to keep the pressure on them. Some of them think they are on the correct side...they can be educated. Others are bought and paid for and deserve nothing but our contempt. JMHO

Stop Amnesty.
Tell congressmen we dont want ANY bill passed, no matter what they promise. This bill is Amnesty for 30 million illegals, and a 1000 page bill that brings in 80 million 3rd world immigrants. The bill will destroy the U.S. and will turn the USA into a socialist state as is the democrats/Obamas plan.

Call all remaining GOP members of the US Congress to back the efforts of those fighting back.

Please sign their petition to require the Speaker to honor the Hastert Rule! If the Senate passes an amnesty for illegal aliens, it will be important that the House refuses to pass any immigration legislation in 2013! Stop the amnesty legislation!

From AZ Senator John McCains recall page:
Do you remember this? McCains Complete the Danged Fence? In June 2013, McCain showed us his true colors and voted against building the 700 mile-long fence (that was required by previous law in 2006).link

I can look anybody in the eye and tell them I once hired a contractor to build a room onto my house. Every time he looked me in the eye and said, "I'm going to tell you the truth..." he lied. It's what liars do. I've called Corker and Alexander this morning - they are lost causes, shamefully. They know their next election (if we have one) will be their last. My Congressman (Roe) I believe to be solid. I've told him to overthrow of Boehner.

Still think what? If it pertains to common sense that the Republicans sorely lack, YES.
