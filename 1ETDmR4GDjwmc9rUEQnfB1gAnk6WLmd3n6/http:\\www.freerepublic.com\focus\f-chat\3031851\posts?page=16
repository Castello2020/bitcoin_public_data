Magna Carta: Passions still running high in Runnymede

A peace treaty sealed in Runnymede in 1215, signalling the end of a conflict between King John and barons who were in revolt, has once again got passions running high in Surrey. ...a debate is raging on what to do in the place where the charter -- hailed by some as the foundation of English democracy -- was sealed. Plans to build an £8m visitor centre in Runnymede as a legacy of the anniversary were dropped earlier this year because of lack of funds. Surrey County Council, Runnymede Borough Council and the National Trust have all said they are now working to find a way to raise the profile of the Magna Carta and the site where it was sealed. But the Magna Carta Trust's 800th committee, which is overseeing global commemorations to mark the anniversary, has said the lack of an interpretation centre at the site is a "travesty". ...Some historians have disputed the importance of the Magna Carta, arguing that of its 63 clauses, only three have not now been repealed or become obsolete. But Professor Saul said there could be no doubt about its significance. He said: "The idea that Magna Carta was a narrow 'feudal' document was wrong... There can be no doubting the historical importance of Magna Carta. It established the principle that the executive power -- in this case, the king -- is subject to the law just like everyone else. "Later in the 13th Century the jurist Bracton wrote 'in England the king is below God and below the law'. The crucial clause is clause 39: No free man shall be arrested, imprisoned or dispossessed without judgement of his peers or against the law of the land.

I wonder if the lack of interest has any connection of a dwindling Anglo population and massive infiltration of immigrants wanting to destroy the Anglo traditions?Look for the same for the DOI and the Constitution at nation near you.

Inalienable rights first put to pen and codified into law.

The nuns in the Catholic school in the Chicago neighborhood of Bridgeport where I was brought up thought the event so important that 7th graders produced a play on the event for the entire school to watch.
Alas the school Immaculate Conception, and the parish no longer exist. But the church now re-named Holy Family still does run by a religious order. Point being it was a very significant event related to American history .

Under the Great Charter, you could not take a mans home to pay for a debt. This is incorporated into most state laws with Homestead provisions.
If he was a person who moved from place to place and had for instance a wagon and used it for business, you could not seize his way of making a living.
There are numerous clauses relating to civil rights.
Not easy to read though in the Old English!

Conservatives must note and learn that it was a conflict between the elites that gave us the Magna Carta as well as the US Constitution. The people had and always will have little to do with it.
Unless conservatives learn to not only leverage, but seek out the natural conflicts between elites we’ll just keep losing.

Have you seen some of the discussions on the difference between unalienable and inalienable rights?

About 45 years ago, Britain passed some laws to take the place of the Magna Carta. On member of THE HOUSE LORDS spoke on how this would clear the laws of a lot of “JUNK!”
This created such an uproar in the HOUSE that some of the older members who spent their time sleeping during the sessions actually woke up to take part in the debate.

and they still have crappy teeth and ridiculous accents.
Only part I like about England is they have all of Frances furniture from the many battles and wars over the centuries.

The Magna Carta is important to all nations with roots in Britain. Perhaps the committee should try fundraising overseas as well as within Britain.

I noticed your link to the MC that mentioned the Torah. It’s an interesting thing to think about. Surely, God’s Laws existed before being revealed to Moses? Idolatry, murder, adultery must have been wrong prior to the Bereshit and from the moment Adam and Eve departed the Garden practiced.

I found this very interesting:
http://www.gemworld.com/USA-Unalienable.htm
Note that the drafts all stated “inalienable”, but the final versions all say, “unalienable”. Why the change? The important legal distinction between the words.
You can contract away inalienable rights, but unalienable rights can never be lost, even willfully. That’s one of those things that if taught for the last two generations could have kept us out of a lot of bad decisions and trouble.

The Magna Carta was based on remnants of the Roman legal system, surviving in the Latin-literate clerical population of England.

Yes, I know. I was referring to this in your link’s post:

Human rights laws existed before the Magna Carta (Jews followed it in the Torah long before that)

The MC was an elite v. elite document. The hoi polloi weren’t a party to it and it is miraculous how it came to pass as a document of general and not limited rights for all. I suspect the Christian influence via the Torah as the reason.

Magna Carta is considered so important to the developments that eventually lead to our Constitution that a replica is on display in the Capitol:
