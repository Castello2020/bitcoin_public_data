NBC Cancels Radical Left Wing �The Chris Matthews Show�
The Palookaville Post ^

(PP)- Tuesday NBC News, a radical left wing news organization, announced they mercifully will be ending The Chris Matthews Show, an unwatched syndicated public affairs production broadcast out of the NBC News Washington D.C. bureau. The final edition of the dismal program will be forced onto the airwaves July 21. The half-hour slobber-fest aired primarily on Sunday mornings, in an obviously failed attempt to compete with highly respected political programs like FOX News Sunday. Matthews says he is ending the syndicated Sunday show to focus on some MSNBC show called Hardball, said a liberal political insider. But Chris has to admit that serious political thinkers saw his Sunday show as a joke, and he was flat out rejected and will forever be relegated to the MSNBC sandpit of progressive degenerates.

Was there any sort of thrill that ran up the leg of Chris Matthews?

Honestly, I didnt know about this particular show! I can actually picture him showing up on the set Sunday morning in an old filthy bathrobe, raggedy pjs, hair sticking out everywhere on his head and just *hangover mumbling* for a half hour.

NYT: Hardball will continue to fill the 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. weekday hours on the channel. But in the new deal, Mr. Matthews will end his syndicated Sunday talk show, The Chris Matthews Show, in July.

I wonder how Russert would react nowadays? He was a true blue democrat. I’d like to think he wouldn’t approve of the Marxist’s handling of Benghazi, but I’m not sure. Would he have bucked his bosses at NBC?

Well, he no doubt had political leanings. But he asked alot of hard questions, and I saw him more than once make the Dems squirm!
I dunno, I always liked the guy. He was pretty fair and balanced.

He’ll get hired
unlike us they circle the wagons and stick together
and don’t hesitate to use power when they have it
i always wanted to smack Matthews
he reminds me of a guy who tried to “not return” my Rolex Submariner I let him borrow for a few weeks in 1990
I was in Miami living and he told me he was keeping it...lol...he didn’t know me...5 hours later courtesy of Delta airlines ..I was there in north Jackson and he was lying in his driveway with a busted grill and i had my watch
that guy looks just like Matthews..pie face

I've been discouraged of recent...trying hard not to just throw in the towel as it sure seems like our country has abandoned all that was once good and right about it. I flipped news channels tonight and sickened how all our media can report about is sex and abortion and crime...and all the crud of this nation. While all the pundits sit around and talk about it.....and they are just as ridiculous as the so called news they try to report. And yet....you can actually see what's happening in the world by viewing foreign news agencies!.....heck even Aljazzere tops what we're getting!

But for the UK press, we wouldn’t know much about the Boston terrorist and the bombings!
The news media in this country are all about protecting the Marxist and his regime, save for Fox, talk radio and Free Republic!

“There was no audience? How can that be?”
His fellow drunks were still sleeping off their Saturday night bender when the show came on.

If I had the energy I’d try to research...but I wonder what this show’s ratings were compared to his MSNBC drivel.
He’s really an embarrassment to journalists everywhere.

I know that his nasty Hardball show has the lowest rating’s in its time slot. If I remember, I’ll check the Neilsen Report next Monday for the Sunday shows.

It’s amazing what you find out when you read news from around the world. Sometimes even Russia’s Pravda reports a decent story, so that term might actually be an insult to them.LOL

I heard there was a show they called hardball; it’s a Saturday Night Live spinoff where a goofy guy who is white pretends he’s got a special racism radar. He’s always detecting it in others, but goes home each night to his lilly white community. It’s a real hoot of a show, or at least the five minutes I saw were because they comedians all do this over-the-top schtick with ignorant sterotypes of the loyal opposition.
