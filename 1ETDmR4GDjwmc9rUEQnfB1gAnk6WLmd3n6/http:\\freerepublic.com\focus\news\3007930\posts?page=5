<p>On ABC&#39;s <em>This Week</em> Sunday, George Will made a comment about the need for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants that is likely to raise eyebrows on both sides of the aisle.<p> &quot;As the baby boomers retire, and as the birthrate declines, we need something to replenish the workforce to sustain the welfare state&quot; (video follows with transcript and commentary):<p><b>*NOTE: Video at link*</b><p align="center">
 <blockquote>
  <p>
  <p><img alt="" src="http://newsbusters.org/sites/default/files/2012/Will%20414.png" /><br />
   <br /> JONATHAN KARL, SUBSTITUTE HOST: George, right to you. You heard a debate among Republicans on immigration. Which side should the Republican Party come down on?<p> GEORGE WILL: Every conservative sympathizes with what Jeff Sessions was saying about not rewarding law breaking. However, conservatism begins with facing facts. The facts are that of the 11 million people who are here illegally, two-thirds have been here a decade or more, 30 percent, 15 years or more. They&#39;re woven into our society. They&#39;re not leaving. And the American people would not tolerate the police measures necessary to extract them from our community. Therefore, the great consensus has to be on the details of a path to citizenship.<p> The most important thing Rubio said in your interview was, even if the system weren&#39;t broken, if you had no illegal immigrants, we&#39;d still need to do something about this because we need the workers. As the baby boomers retire, and as the birthrate declines, we need something to replenish the workforce to sustain the welfare state.<p> KARL: The framing from Rubio was interesting, saying we really already have amnesty. Nobody&#39;s prosecuting the undocumented immigrants here now.<p> RUTH MARCUS, WASHINGTON POST: Absolutely, I want to say I&#39;m going to really enjoy saying this next sentence. I completely agree with every syllable that George Will just said. And I think that the stars are in alignment for many of the reasons that he said.</blockquote>

 <p> &quot;As the baby boomers retire, and as the birthrate declines, we need something to replenish the workforce to sustain the welfare state.&quot;<p> Is this an inconvenient truth or a stretch?<p> We know that this is a problem that countries such as Japan are already facing. Most of Europe is projected to see a peak in population in the next few decades. When this happens, entitlement programs become impossible to fund if they aren&#39;t already.<p> The velocity of our population growth has been slowing for decades.<p> As such, does Will have a point or should our future budget woes be irrelevant to this debate?<br clear="all" /></p>

    I&#39;ve believe this is one of the main reasons behind the legalization push. <p>TPTB don&#39;t want secure borders because they want to continue to attract illegal aliens to shore up the population. <p>They&#39;re desperate for new sources of revenue.

    <p>No one really wants the secured borders.</p>
<p>That minor roof work that your neighbor wanted done...will be eventually done by Juan, who walked over the border last year, and is doing first-rate work for thirty-percent less than the professional roofer quoted.</p>
<p>The under-the-table deal that your local butcher arranged with a major grocery in Ohio....only accomplished because of the ten illegal butchers from Honduras that he recruited and brought in...working cash only...for thirty percent less than any of the regular employees would have accepted.</p>
<p>The $6k landscaping job that you finally got done this year....done by Juan the illegal....and you saved $500 over what the real landscaping service would have charged.</p>
<p>We all want the illegals to stay...mostly as the situation lays right now. No changes.</p>

    So flooding the country with uneducated, illiterate, linguistically challenged, illegal immigrants is held up as a positive good in order to support a Ponzi scheme welfare state system. <p>The current insustainability of the welfare state is at least partly due to the fact that these illegal immigrants long-term cost the system far more than they contribute.

    <p>With the majority of illegals and their offspring ill-educated and on some sort of welfare during their working years they are not the solution. Increased immigration for skilled immigrants ould help, but that&#8217;s not the vast majority of whom we&#8217;re looking to legalize.</p>

    This problem will also be addressed by restricted access to second rate health care for the boomers and associated accelerated death rates that will not reported. Social mores will also be changed to encourage ending one&rsquo;s life &ldquo;for the children&rdquo; and the government harvesting of retirement wealth such as IRAs for the greater good.

    Both he and these sub-humans we call politicians are correct in one sense about sustaining the welfare state. <p> There <i>is</i> a problem with sustainment of the OASDI provisions of the FICA, Social Security. There simply aren&#39;t enough workers entering the ranks of the employed here to sustain it. It is because there are millions upon millions who are on one of 83 programs of government welfare not connected with Social Security. That, coupled with the ever increasing deluge of new SSDI applications (and approvals) has completed the gravestone - only the date of death is to be filled in.<p> While SS (the old age part) is something that is not likely to go away, the disability part of that can certainly be reduced - there are far to many specious claims and outright fraud; both SSDI and SSI comprise nearly 25% of the outlays.<p> However, the politicians will not touch either and have landed on another solution. Take 11 million (so they say) illegals and make them legal - take their $8/hour wages, take 6.2% of that over 2000 hours per year and add that to the &quot;fund&quot; lockbox or whatever you want to call it. $992 per year is what it works out to for each illegal. They contribute $82/month and they get $625/month when they claim retirement (and for their spouses)....smart business move.<p> The other benefit is Democrat votes. They will NEVER vote for a Republican because a Democrat will always promise more. The boon they offer to illegals, citizenship, opens them up for literally ALL of the 83 welfare programs mentioned above.<p> Notwithstanding the &#39;benefits&#39; of illegals (name some), the disadvantages, the intangible costs of them are horrendous, and they are always glossed over or just plain overlooked when a liberal is talking about them. They just want more voters and to hell with the rest of us.<p> It is a no win situation both from an economic and ideology standpoint. Playing Whack-a-Mole at 10 times normal speed.<p> I wrote two checks yesterday, one for $9000+ and the other for $3000 + to pay for all this (in addition to what I had taken away from me before that). Next year, I won&#39;t be doing so; and they won&#39;t be able to take as much away either. I&#39;ve checked out and given up. There is no point in working and amassing anything this government will eventually take away from you. Everything I have is paid for, and my monthly outlays are minimum. My income is managed now to just enough to get by and to minimize what they can take. Let the illegals pay for all this.

    <p>Will&#8217;s hypothesis is a curious one. I&#8217;ve done the research, and even with Amnesty, it will only delay, not correct the problem.</p>
<p>The average age of immigrants to America is far older than it is for the families that are already here. Immigration makes sense in order to obtain skilled professionals willing to assimilate.</p>
<p>It makes zero sense on demographic grounds. It&#8217;s not going to stop the aging of America.</p>

    FTA: <i>And the American people would not tolerate the police measures necessary to extract them from our community.</i><p> That&#39;s mere supposition without a scintilla of fact to support it.

<p>Here in south Texas, you would not recognize the fact that it was once American for we now live in Texaco, not Texas. 80% of the language spoken here is Spanish and they make no effort to speak or write English.

    What makes Rubio think the illegal border invaders are contributing to the funding of welfare rather than adding to its burdens? Is Rubio ignorant or is he trying to be slick? Doctors, lawyers, engineers and scientists didn&#39;t cross the border illegally; low skill migrants did (along with terrorists, rapists, murderers drunk drivers and drug smugglers). If he&#39;s naive enough to believe that granting them amnesty will bring them out of the shadows to obtain proper employment that will make a significant difference to the entitlement funds, perhaps he can tell real Americans where these jobs are now so suffering Americans can get them.

    Apparently we need to import uneducated immigrants to fill the labor void created by killing almost 55 million American babies since 1973 while our government is paying people to sit at home and collect welfare. All of this hastened by the talking heads of the liberal media. What a great plan for our own destruction or reduction to third-world status. Is this the end run around national sovereignty Richard Gardner called for in 1974?<p><i>&quot;In short, the &quot;house of world order&quot; will have to be built from the bottom up rather than from the top down. It will look like a great &quot;booming, buzzing confusion,&quot; to use William James&#39; famous description of reality, but an end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomplish much more than the old-fashioned frontal assault. Of course, for political as well as administrative reasons, some of these specialized arrangements should be brought into an appropriate relationship with the central institutions of the U.N. system, but the main thing is that the essential functions be performed.&quot; Richard N.

    Yep, illegal aliens allowed to wait 10 years for legal status &quot;with no welfare benefits&quot; during that time is &quot;an excellent and practical solution&quot;. I beg to differ.<p>Since there&#39;s gloomy prospects of living wages for millions upon millions of alien families who will be undergoing the wait while living in a Ponzi economy near collapse......and since the members of said extended illegal families will be aged, be sick, be injured, become handicapped, be malnourished, be giving birth, etc. the Supreme Court will OVERTURN the &quot;no health and welfare benefits&quot; law in a heartbeat (especially since we probably will have an unstoppable Obama court majority in the very near future).<p>Let&#39;s be realistic. I think everyone knows that illegals will continue to receive the benefits during the waiting period just as if they were documented citizens. The Supremes will mandate it. Any politician, including Rubio, knows this, also....and they are lying through their teeth with their reassuring, slick words, promises and explanations to the contrary.<p>We are being led into a total socialist/welfare by our rulers in both parties....a state where everyone will be equally broke except the rulers.<p>Leni

    <i> You heard a debate among Republicans on immigration.</i><p> But this has nothing to do with immigration. Immigration involves making oneself known to the destination country&#39;s government via an application, awaiting a decision and living with the result. In the event the application is approved, the process also involves gaining knowledge and appreciation of the new nation&#39;s laws and customs as well as swearing an oath of allegiance - however quaint that may seem. <p> If we&#39;re going to call illegally crossing the border, illegally staying in a foreign country and illegally gaining access to public funds &#39;immigration,&#39; then we should start calling theft &#39;borrowing,&#39; however permanent the borrowing may be. <p><i>Conservatism begins with facing facts</i><p> No, conservatism begins with the rule of constitutional law. Fiscal conservatism begins with living within our means. Indian and Pakistani engineers will contribute much more to our society financially, culturally and in terms of reduced criminality than Mexican leaf blowers. <p><i>The facts are that of the 11 million people who are here illegally, two-thirds have been here a decade or more, 30 percent, 15 years or more.</i><p> 11 million is a laughably low estimate. And I&#39;m not bothered how long they&#39;ve been here. Perhaps by now they may have picked up a word or two of English and know full well they&#39;re breaking the law. <p><i> They&#39;re woven into our society.</i><p> Right. By speaking and writing only Spanish and refusing any and all attempts to learn English, as well as forcing schools and public institutions (who know that Jose Gonzales is illegally here but do nothing about it) to become bilingual. Many don&#39;t pay taxes, many send as much cash out of the country as often as possible (which is why Mexico does nothing), many facilitate additional lawbreaking by relatives and friends who enter illegally, and they contribute to and participate in political causes like La Raza who exploit and exacerbate the problem. They are not woven. They are a stain. <p><i> They&#39;re not leaving.</i><p> I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s up them. <p><i>And the American people would not tolerate the police measures necessary to extract them from our community.</i><p> Just try us, George. I&#39;ll carry the baton and lead the marching band as the parade of buses drives south. <p> Meanwhile, police measures continue to constrict around the throat of proper Americans. East German style checkpoints, TSA/DHS nonsense, gun control, taxes, a million regulations and a million bureaucrats. The Mexicans in America ignore all of these by playing dumb, refusing any form of ID or registration (or forging it), and enjoying political favoritism. <p><i> Therefore, the great consensus has to be on the details of a path to citizenship.</i><p> Er, no it doesn&#39;t. Stop drinking the Potomac water directly from the tap, George. If they aren&#39;t leaving, then we must first keep those here to a finite number. Seal the border. The first and next Mexican who reaches America will be known, registered, tracked and removed if he overstays his visa. The 11 (or 20, or 30) million who are here are a special case and must NEVER become citizens, especially in the case of elections. Rewarding lawbreaking will only invite more of the same. That is more than a fair enough trade, no matter what desperate, grasping politicians want. <p> As for the welfare state, how will illegals who don&#39;t pay taxes contribute to supporting such a state? Moreover, how will illegals receiving a piece of pie they didn&#39;t help bake ensure the stability of the welfare state? It&#39;s like dousing a fire with gasoline.

<p>&#8220;documented status&#8221; is for collecting benefits. The taxpaying part will still remain &#8220;undocumented&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been to certain parts of Mexico or elsewhere in Latin America, you do not truly understand actual poverty.</p>
<p>This is the sort of poverty that we will be importing to America - there is no way the welfare state can keep up, it will break and then multi-tens of millions of illegals along with a much greater number of native born and otherwise legal citizens will be right back to the intense, grinding poverty that we used to only find next door.</p>

    Will was absolutely correct about one thing. <p>There are <u>exactly</u> 11 million illegal aliens. Of course, if one were to leave LA County, one might easily turn up 20 million or so more, but let&#39;s not go there, OK?
