G�bekli Tepe, Turkey: a new wonder of the ancient world (9,000 B.C. Neolithic site)

"Wow," exclaims the visitor from New Zealand, a place, after all, with a human history shorter than most. For from a wooden walkway were gazing down at an archaeological site of giddying age. Built about 9000 BC, its more than twice as old as Stonehenge or the Pyramids, predating the discovery of metals, pottery or even the wheel. This is Göbekli Tepe in south-eastern Turkey, generally reckoned the most exciting and historically significant archaeological dig currently under way anywhere in the world, and there are neither queues nor tickets to get in. Wow for a number of reasons, then, though its neither the access nor the staggering implications of the sites age that has particularly impressed the man from distant Auckland. Neolithic Göbekli Tepe is also remarkably beautiful. From the partially excavated pit rise circular arrangements of huge T-shaped obelisks exquisitely carved with foxes, birds, boars and snakes or highly stylised human attributes including belts, loincloths and limbs. Were profoundly moved by this glimpse into a radically recast prehistory, and mystified too. Even the archaeologists hard at work on this September morning can only speculate about its function, not least because the stones appear to have been deliberately buried. This series of sanctuaries is the oldest known monumental architecture, explains the excavation leader and approachable on-site presence Professor Klaus Schmidt. Maybe burial was already part of their concept from the very beginning.(continued)

Put Gobekli complex was buried on purpose ... why have such a complex arrangement of structures then cover it with sand and abandon it?

I don’t know *why* they buried it but I’m glad they did! Have you looked at photos of the carvings? They’re in pristine condition. Look like they were done last week. It’s an astounding find and most people say “gobble gobble what?” when you try to tell them about it. ;o)

I have guessed that the pillars with “T” shape were holding up roofing timbers. The carvings do not appear to have been heavily weathered the way the Sphinx was, from rain and flowing water.

Sadly, the authors of that article are not too bright:
“We used to think agriculture gave rise to cities and later to writing, art, and religion. Now the worlds oldest temple suggests the urge to worship sparked civilization.”
Wouldn’t that be obvious to anyone who can think?

I agree. Cities have always grown up around churches and temples. I wonder if the cultivation of grain was at least partly in response to a need to feed ancient visiting pilgrims (for a price, of course).

That supports the view that those living today are the only smart ones that gets it and all those early beings were a bunch of “hayseeds” that actually looked to an outside source as the creator.

I wonder if the monoliths themselves might be remnants of some even older civilization; their hard square edges and the detail of the carvings are very sophisticated. They almost look like some sort of antediluvian highway support pillars.
The carvings are interesting to contemplate as they are not carved into the stone monoliths, but sit in relief on the surface. That required an amazing amount of carving to produce the monoliths; 12,000 years ago.

It was designed by a royal architect from the neo-cartoonical school- When the King NutTar and his Queen Ishtar saw it after it was completed, the Queen didn`t like all the animal cartoons which she said ranked of ox bestiality and lizard fetishes. So the King ordered it buried coz it was offensive to his Queen`s royal eyes. He killed the neo-cartoonical architect and found another architect who was schooled in the Pre-Byzantine style which has a lotsa domes and spires and arches and loudspeakers and beards. However, the animal fetish memory was forever enshrined into the name of the new city, Ish-Dung-Bull, not far from this site,by the new royal architect who was of friend of the old dead royal architect, who was from San Francisco. But it could not be fully suppressed and soon spread to Paris. This royal ban on erotic fetish cities is what started the Trojan War soon afterwards. Centuries later the neo-cartoonical school was re-born in Sodom and Gomnorreah.

I think I read they say they have only uncovered what, like 5 percent of what’s there?
No doubt there are still many amazing things to find.
With all the animal motifs and the circles, I’ve been inclined to think...
Is this Planet Earths first zoo?

Read “The Source” by James Michener, which traces the people of ancient Israel.
Written a few decades ago, it is nevertheless a good read about ancient civilization in the region.

The site also has no food stored there that they have found. Perhaps it predates eating?

I think it was an entry portal for working bioengineers among the Ancient Aliens General Operations Division.
Images of the fauna and flora they might be working with or seeing as tourists were placed strategically around the lobby like travel posters today.
And on the seventh cosmic day, the chief of the G.O.D. looked around, said, “That’s a wrap. Let’s leave it to ‘em with G.O.D.s blessing.”

People have been eating long before this one site was constructed; there’s no telling what it was used for — someone on the thread suggested it was the first zoo, which is amusing. 8000 years ago, still in preceramic times, a group from the mainland colonized Cyprus, their origin known from their rubbish tip, where bones of the species they brought along for food were found.

I can’t think, and your claim doesn’t make any sense. Agriculture led to larger populations and a need to settle disputes over boundaries, water supplies, and raiding by outsiders and neighboring groups. That necessitated recordkeeping. The rise of literature followed the rise of accounting and title deeds. Agriculture brought about food surpluses, and the rise of other crafts not related to agriculture, as well as standing armies to defend territory and food and water supplies.

The site has barely been touched, That was kind of my point. Who knows what we might find there. So saying that it was "before...." when we truly have no idea when those things were discovered is rather presumptuous. Absence of evidence should not be assumed to be evidence of absence.

From the Geographic essay:
Puzzle piled upon puzzle as the excavation continued. For reasons yet unknown, the rings at Göbekli Tepe seem to have regularly lost their power, or at least their charm. Every few decades people buried the pillars and put up new stonesa second, smaller ring, inside the first. Sometimes, later, they installed a third. Then the whole assemblage would be filled in with debris, and an entirely new circle created nearby. The site may have been built, filled in, and built again for centuries.

They weren't known to be working with stone that early either. And yet not only were they working with stone but they were working with big stones. They thought that metal was first worked in the middle east around 4200 BC. They they found Varna. And found worked metal from 4600 BC and in Europe. And now they found a copper chisel that is from 5500BC in Prokuplje Serbia. The more we find the more the dates keep getting pushed back. Saying "before we know metal was used" is correct. Saying "before metal was used" is not.

People have worked with stone for 100s of 1000s of years, including some possible small images of animals and such; one apparent stylized statue of a human dates back 400K years. Stone was used to work stone at this site. But it appears you’re really just objecting to the writing in the article.

Yes, that is exactly what I am objecting to and I should have said building with stone rather then working with stone. I object to things stated as fact rather then stated as opinion or quantified with the statement that with our current level of knowledge this is what we believe. And yes I understand that this was written by a travel writer rather then a scientist but my objection stands.
