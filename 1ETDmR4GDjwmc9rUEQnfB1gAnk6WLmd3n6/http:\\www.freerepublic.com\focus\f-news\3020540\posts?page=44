<p>CHARLIE ROSE: You have seen lots of second terms. This one came in on a big political victory, wanting to do things. And you have this picture, one, of intrusive government and yet a president who seems like a bystander in his own government. <p>BOB SCHIEFFER: People were talking in Washington about -- some people were saying, &quot;Are we back to the Nixon administration? This is what they did in the Nixon administration.&quot; This is not the Nixon administration, where you had burglars and people talking about blowing up the Brookings Institution. This is more of a case, is anybody home? <p>I mean, just all of a sudden you have this thing with the Justice Department where they&#146;re getting all these phone records of all the reporters. The Attorney General, well he didn&#146;t know anything about it. You get to the IRS, they don&#146;t seem to know anything about the Tea Party thing. You come to White House, they don&#146;t know anything about Benghazi. Somebody&#146;s got to grab hold of this thing. It&#146;s very, very disturbing what we&#146;re seeing here. <p>NORAH O&#146;DONNELL: What do you make of the president&#146;s actions yesterday? He dealt with all three things yesterday: He fired the head of the IRS. Released 100 pages of emails that deal with Benghazi. And then on the third scandal the snooping into the AP reporters&#146; phone records, the president then put out that he&#146;s for this shield law for journalists. The White House took a lot of proactive action yesterday. <p>SCHIEFFER: They did. But that was yesterday. How is it these things all &#150; nobody seemed to be taking very seriously up until this point? There is no question though, that the administration was trying to get the story out that the War on Terrorism, the threat of terrorism...<br clear="all" /></p>

    I was in college at the time of Watergate and thought I was paying attention, never recall the desire of &lsquo;blowing up of the Brookings Institute&rsquo;.<p> But, put that in perspective to Obama who choomed around and was a friend of Bill Ayers who actually did blow things up.

    <p>They also say that Nixon had the IRS go after his enemies because of an off the cuff comment that Nixon made on the secret tapes.</p>
<p>Despite the Media spin it never happened, unlike Obama actually doing it.</p>
<p>The Media back then obsessed on the 18 minutes missing from the Nixon Tapes, but nowadays the idea that Obama disappeared for 10 hours during the Benghazi attacks isn&#8217;t ever mentioned. Gee, wonder why?</p>

    The media has done so much harm to our freedoms by encouraging/allowing Obama&#146;s un American agenda to endure/ making it to where an out of control character successfully has protection by them. The media has made our government into a mockery as well. Rule of law, forget that now. Hold people accountable, not if you&#146;re a liberal democrat or far left winger. It&#146;s only about them and this stupid mindset/don&#146;t call the terrorists names/ blame America/ America bad/get more people onto the government handout/over tax the worker so they can waste the money in what The -IRS going after you or me because of our views/ free speech.<p> Many can see the Obama team is not for all of us. Don&#146;t you wonder why the so called journalists seem to be unpatriotic to their country. They must hate us on the opposite side as much as Obama does. Just no other way to explain why they have allowed him time and time again to overreach his authority. Obama has abused his power for a very long while. There has to be a place of judgment on them as well because they have covered up the lies. This entire situation with the IRS is scary. How anyone can allow him to get away with this is a travesty. What will stop the next president into allowing this type of abuse.

    &ldquo;But he KNOWS that Sandra Fluke needs condoms!!&rdquo;<p> Very good point. Also, the media uproar about that was much more pronounced than what we are seeing now over multiple cover ups and abuses of power. The media is absolutely incapable of being objective and fair anymore. Incapable. When you put a hateful ideologue in power, and take away media oversight, this is what you get.

Saying higher ups could be anyone above her,building leadership is Hillary and they know it,these rats are pathetic,especially Donnelly,she has her knee pads on at all times for Obama.</p>

    <p>Don&#8217;t take this as a complete defense of the MSM.</p>
<p>But when a press conference happens, it&#8217;s well known the it&#8217;s the White House that decides beforehand who will be allowed questions.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read a number of reports saying basically &#8220;They told us if we asked that question, we&#8217;d be cut off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Combine that with the thought that maybe they would have a better &#8220;relationship&#8221; with liberal type reporters, and you can see the outcome, it&#8217;s right in front of you.</p>
<p>Combine that with the idea that most reporters are as spineless as Boehner.</p>
<p>Combine that with the idea that even if a government employee does something wrong, they are unlikely to get fired, and if they are fired, they still get their pensions, and probably just pick up a cushy job lobbying for some outfit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s totally corrupt. Totally Machiavellian. I saw the corruption in the early 90&#8217;s and have not voted since then. I am not a voluntary individual member of a corrupt system.<br />
I am willing to stand 100% behind a true, Constitutional Republic, but we have not had that for decades, maybe almost a century.</p>

<div class="b2">
    <p>&#8220;Colson admits to doing many unsavory things in his time before converting to Christianity, but he prefers to be infamous only for the real ones, writing:</p>
<p>SIR &#150; I noticed that your review of a biography of Richard Nixon referred to me in a couple of unflattering ways, including the notion that I contemplated firebombing the Brookings Institution (&#147;The fuel of power&#148;, May 10th). You need to know, if it ever does any good, that this is untrue. The fellow that testified about it during Watergate has totally recanted.</p>
<p>It is not true that I ever urged or suggested it. It was the idea of one Jack Caulfield, who told me about it in the White House men&#146;s room, and I told him he was crazy. Mr Caulfield called me one day and said he wanted to make amends; that I had been unfairly treated, and he was sorry. He later confirmed this to Jonathan Aitken, who wrote a biography of me. I don&#146;t know if it does any good to try to change these things now, but that is the fact.</p>
<p>Chuck Colson</p>
<p>I was able to locate the relevant passage of Aitken&#146;s book, Charles W. Colson: A Life Redeemed, online and it confirms Colson&#146;s claim. It&#146;s not well-known that Caulfield recanted his allegation, so the Economist doesn&#146;t look all that bad. Still, fact-checking is supposed to be the big advantage of the mainstream media, isn&#146;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The History Commons, quoting Bernstein, Dean, et al give rise to the myth/lie. Still checking.</p>

    <p>Soon MSM will roll over for Obama. They can&#8217;t let Hillary down. Most of them are wimps who don&#8217;t know how to think independently. They just take orders from their media bosses. What&#8217;s funny is that most of them are so clueless they don&#8217;t even realize they are nothing but paid propagandists. When they claim to be an unbiased reporter, they really think that&#8217;s true. The MSM follows the Chinese media model, which is call yourself a reporter, but please don&#8217;t do any hard-hitting reporting against the Leftist Establishment or you will get fired.</p>
