Explanation: Could life ever have existed on Mars? To help find out, humanity landed the Curiosity rover on Mars last August. To make sure the car-sized explorer survived the interplanetary trip and dramatic landing intact, the above image and others was taken peering at, under, and around Curiosity. Pictured above in this unusual vista are three of Curiosity's six wheels, each measuring about half a meter across. In recent months, Curiosity has been exploring the surroundings of an area dubbed Yellowknife Bay. Analyses of data taken by Curiosity's cameras and onboard laboratories has provided strong new evidence that Mars could once have supported life. In the distance is part of the slope to the central peak inside Gale Crater that Curiosity is scheduled to attempt to climb -- Mt. Sharp.

Problem with that pic is it’s just a rock.
A rock with a very long, extended tail, perfectly symmetrical legs, and a very lizard-like face.
Now I believe there is life on Mars - simple bacteria, (actually, a couple of the craft sent there were never totally scrubbed before launch), there’s probably 100 different kinds of fungi and lichens on Earth that would love it om Mars. Maybe even some primitive plants.
Higher organisms... with the low atmospheric pressure.. the cold... that’s getting harder to believe.

Is that martian roadkill?!? Did Curiosity run over a Martian squirrel? (which looks suspiciously like an earth squirrel).

How can you tell if the legs are symmetrical if you can only see one side?
