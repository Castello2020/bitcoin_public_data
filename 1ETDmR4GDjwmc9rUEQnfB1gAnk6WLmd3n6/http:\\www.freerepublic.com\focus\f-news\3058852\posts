Hang ‘em, hang ‘em high but before you do beat his head in just a bit with a metal flashlight, just a bit, you know like a break to the Zygomatic bone.
Oh! I’m sorry, am I being “cruel and unusual” in my punishment? OK, then just string ‘em up without the hits to his head...

No matter what he deserves, I can’t believe he should get:
Free food
Free clothes
Free place to sleep
Free medical
Free legal advice
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE!!!
His damn worthless life, he doesn’t deserve any of it. And his chances at rehab are null. Zero, zilch, nada...

Oh! Im sorry, am I being cruel and unusual in my punishment? OK, then just string em up without the hits to his head... This is off topic, but I was listening to NPR on Saturday( I know, I know), and someone has written a book titled In Defense of Flogging. The author is actually recommending flogging as a legal punishment for some minor crimes. Isn't this cruel and unusual punishment? God help us all for what is coming.

String them up by their testicles with number nine piano wire and when they fall... burn them alive where they land... bury their ashes IN a sh!t plant.

Little advertising for a "Marines and Vets Drink Free" at the legion Shorty frequented then drop the two "yutes" off.The boys could probably show them a good time.

Did the caning (four whacks) work for Michael P. Fay who sprayed graffiti on cars in Singapore? He hasn’t done it since!

Weird Al Yankovic music video humorously mentions him.

This has always happened, since time immemorial, though not at the level we see today. What is lacking is the swift justice after crimes are committed. Where is the disincentive to commit crimes is there is no swift justice?

String him up and gut him like a fishbut carefully, so it doesn't kill him. Once the entrails are hanging out, bring in the hungry dogs.

Local news is reporting “several others” were arrested for giving criminal assistance. Very vague on details so far...

I feel awful for these kids in a way, feral kids, raised to act like savages.... Its sad, but they need to be dealt with, the entire culture does... until then, we will see no end.

There is a hunting TV show, Pig Man, that had Ted Nugent and others shooting feral hogs from a helicopter. Ted had his full auto AR-15. They tallied out 450 feral hogs on one ranch.
Its going to come down to either feral thugs or patriotic law abiding citizens being hunted the same way. My bet in Red States is on feral holderites as they hold similarity in cause, cost, destruction and danger to the feral hogs.

Still waaaaaaaaay to fast......string both the savages up over an ant hills while 100% fully conscious and alert. Apply a very small amount of honey. Set up a betting pool to guess how many days it takes for ‘em to check out. (Proceeds go to Shorty’s family and other WW2 vets that could use the help). Sit back and enjoy the show.
