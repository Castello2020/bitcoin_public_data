South Carolina Sheriff tells it like it is
Nov 1, 2011
| djf/Sheriff Chuck Wright
Posted on 11/01/2011 8:52:57 PM PDT by djf
I tried to highlight a video that's out there, but it didn't seem to catch many peoples eyes. So I spent the last TWO HOURS making a transcript of the news conference. Here is what he had to say: _______________________________________________________ Y'all ready? Yesterday, around 2:30, 2 O'clock, something like that, a nice lady was out walking her dog as she normally does and she was walking somewhere around the Milliken property, the Highway 9 area. As she was out walking her dog, a fella, I won't call him a gentleman, by the name of Walter Monroe Lance decides that he would check to see if the dog was gonna bite her(sic), bite him, and basically in a nutshell this guy attacks this lady and drags her into the woods threatening to kill her and trying to have sexual intercourse with her. Now Walter Monroe Lance was picked out of a lineup, there are a lot of people who are saying that they saw him over in the area, I can't get too deep into the investigation it's not completed and I won't tell you some things that I know about this case. I can tell you that our form of justice IS NOT MAKING IT! This fella that has been charged numerous times for crimes against women and crime in society, he's been in jail more times than I have and I'm the head of the jail over there and he seems to get out quicker than I can get out and I am I am aggravated. I've had liberals call me and tell me "Chain gang is not gonna work!" Well, let me inform you that your form of justice isn't working either. This gentleman had been comvicted of twenty charges dating back to 1983 ranging from public disorderly conduct, criminal domestic violence, third or subsequent offenses, assault and battery with intent to kill, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, resisting arrest and escape. Now if anybody sitting in this room had been charged with any of this stuff they'd probably be finding a tall oak tree and a short rope for us. (long sigh) He just served 14 months on a federal probation violation for being in possession of a weapon. I don't think every single person needs to be in jail forever, but I believe this animal right here (holds up picture) don't deserve to be out in our society walking along aside of our women. I don't think that this animal should have a right or an option to try and violate a lady who is a good upstanding member of society and doesn't cause trouble and now has to live along with her family and friends has to deal with this senseless act. Now I don't want to make this just a crime against a woman, this is a crime that is, this is a horrific crime. This ladies life was theatened so many times during this act, it's almost too bad that somebody with a concealed weapons permit had not walked by and heard the cries. That would fix it. That would have fixed this. It's gonna get, if we don't do something in our society to change the way our justice system is not working, that's about what you're gonna start having. People are sick and tired of doing the right thing, doing the right thing, doing the right thing, and then people popping out of the back doors of the jails on account of some technicality. This time he's been charged with criminal sexual conduct in the second degree, I'm sorry, that was '09, this list has all the sudden dropped the case after attempts to locate the victim, he couldn't locate the victim in 2009. The victim in that case was nothing like the one we have now, the victim than had some shades in her past anyway this lady who is the latest victim didn't have those. (inaudible question from audience) Nope. I can't because I don't have the details on that I don't know. Ladies, walk in groups. Get a concealed weapons permit. I want you to get a concealed weapons permit. I don't want you to go for the mace, I want you to get a concealed weapons permit. There won't be any doubt if you need to use your firearm to defend your life... I don't want this to happen, but I'm tellin ya I am tired of lookin at victims and saying we're sorry, we done the best we can to get them in jail so I am a big opponent of... somebody asked me about gun control. Gun control to me is when you can get your barrel back on the target quick. That's gun control. Gun control for government purposes has NEVER worked. Now I'll answer some questions, but I'm really aggravated.. a lady on a Sunday, after noon guys, Sunday, walking her dog, and this animal comes up and attacks her, and I'm aggravated by it. I'm very proud of our investigative team who has not given up, obviously the victim was very, very upset when we found her, we just kept doing the right things and kept working and doing the things we know we're supposed to be doing need to be doing and the public helped out again and thank you again, public. This guys family doesn't... you can't blame the family, it's HIM, HIM and HIM ALONE, can you blame for acting like an animal. Now I'll take questions I think I've said enough. (inaudible question) I'll just say from good tips, is all I'll say. (inaudible question) It was from people around the general area, is all I'll say to that too. (inaudible question) He's not suspected in a string of or a serial type... no, he's not. Of course now, we are so early in this, it could be. We will look for that. We will see if he matches any other descriptions, any other MO's, we certainly don't want to charge him for anything he has not done. We'll be cautious not to do that. (inaudible question) I don't think no woman can stay married to him, he beats them down so much. (inaudible question) People like this guy don't fight the police or the men folk, he jump on the women, so we took him into custody kinda peaceful... (inaudible question) Umm 14 Front Street. (inaudible question) I'm not gonna answer that. Very close. Within walking distance close. We patrol Milliken all the time. It is certainly not their fault, I dunno, you can't blame a landowner for an animal being on their property, they don't invite this, they've called us in the past for other things, the gay thing, other types of trespassing, whether it be gay or just people making out, we just try to do a sting and keep it as clean as we can, but you can't get it all... umm I want you to get a concealed gun permit... there's a fanny pack layin right there can I see that (holds up a small fanny oack) they make these right here, where you can conceal a small pistol in them. They got one called The Judge that shoots a .45 or a .410 shell you don't have to be accurate, you just got to get close. So there's gun shops right here that sell that sort of thing. Now I know I'm gonna get lit up, by people who don't like guns. Guns have not killed a single person without somebody stupid being on the trigger anyway... so gun safety, I'm all about gun safety, but I want them to get their concealed weapons permit, I want these people to stop forever doing this... I am tired of looking at these victims... I am tired of looking at these people and saying "You know, there's life after this."... The husband now, now he's gotta deal with this along with his wife... I don't know if they have children but they gotta deal with this as well... granddaughters maybe... family and friends that she works with... and all of them gotta go through this now because this knucklehead, who can't stay outa trouble, can't control his impulses... (inaudible question) _____________________________________________________ Thee is about a minute of further discussion about users of the property and things like that, and the video ends when the Sheriff basically says "I better shut up or I'm in trouble" and once again urges everyone present to get their concealed weapons permit. I think it's important to note that law enforcement is actually pretty much doing their best. But sometimes even their best is not good enough. Combine that with an assembly line criminal justice system, and we might all end up victims. Bump to any/all you might think needs/wants to read what he had to say!

Took a while.
Obviously, I watched the vid a bunch of times. I was deeply impressed by his honesty. But man, I felt sorry for him, you can feel his utter frustration...
If all the courts are going to do with a guy like this is treat him like he was a 14 year old who stole an IPod, what the heck is even the point of having the courts in the first place?
The guy is a predator. Somewhere along the line, a bunch of red flags should have gone off. Big time.
And a cookie-cutter justice system, a bunch of lawyers “Well, ya win some, ya lose some...” that kind of attitude is far LESS than the public needs.deserves or even pays for.
Something gotta change.

Thank you for doing the transcript - the Enemedia would not do it, being commie gun grabbers.
I’d suggest we all email the Sheriff and thank him for what he said.

That would have fixed this. There was a time, at least in the South, the Sheriff would make a phone call letting someone know where his keys would be at a time he and his men would be taking a break in the back room. Pigs like this would be found hanging in their jail cell. A suicide, of course.

This Sheriff is absolutely telling the truth. I hope it starts a trend when other police leadership come out and tell the public the truth about what the hell is going on their judicial system.
Failed war on drugs now becomes war on Constitution and citizens
Revolving door prosecution letting violent criminals back on the street with little or no punishment, multiple times. Private practice attorneys flourish and making a killing from repeat offenders.
High crime rates have forced police departments to have more staff and as a result, they are hiring people who would never be considered for law enforcement. Political hiring running rampant as well.
To maintain the war on drugs, police agencies have had to resort to things like fixed radar posts and red light cameras to generate revenue, which have exorbitant fines.
Because of weak prosecution, and still very high crime rate, citizens have lost all faith in the judicial system to protect them from repeat offenders. Whereas twenty years ago there was not such a hue and cry for citizens to arm themselves for everyday concealed carry, more and more people are doing it and even considering open carry of rifles. And yet the judicial system remains willingly ignorant or cognizant of this.
Angry mobs of people with firearms tend to have summary court, guilt finding, sentence, and execution in a very short period of time. The problem becomes when those mobs fully realize the expediency of their methods and that ANY offense can be a hangin’ offense.

Well said. Too bad Walter Monroe Lance can’t read. Bet he knows what the pointy end of a gun is, though.

The criminal justice system is broken. If it gets any more broken, people are going to start ignoring it entirely and dealing with criminals “privately”.

It’s happened in the past, not much, but it has happened. I barely recall a case in Texas?? years ago when some guy was a troublemaker. EVERYBODY in town HATED this dude. And in truth, he was a first class SOB,
One afternoon he’s downtown and there’s a crowd around, a shot rings and and he falls over dead.
The police ask tons of questions.
Nobody saw nothin.
The police keep asking questions.
Nobody saw nothin,
Police finally have to give up cause nobody saw nothin.
IIRC, they made a movie about it.
Isn’t it also a legal defense in Georgia that you can bring up in court that the victim in some cases is somebody who “needed killin”? I seem to recall hearing that...

Thanks.
I’ve also heard you know rumors of cases of people who just disappear...
I live in Western Washington state and there’s Indian res territory nearby, they own a couple sections, 3 or 4. (1Mi X 1MI) along the White river, you hear stories that there have been a few folks who have come to their final resting place buried a few feet down deep in the woods over there.
I’ve done a little bit of fishing and some hiking over there (lots of brown bear) and tell ya what, if somebody did get killed and skedaddled in those woods, LE ain’t never gonna find them...

I want this Sheriff to be Attorney General, he could have attorneys on his staff to advise him on the finer points of the law. He’d beat the one we have all to pieces.
