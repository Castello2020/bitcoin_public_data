I’m in unincorporated Pierce county, well east of Tacoma, and there are many farmers and livestock owners around.
Pretty conservative here.
Face it, Tacoma, Bellevue, and Seattle run the state. And if they can’t honestly win an election, they have ZERO trepidation about outright STEALING it!

They didn't honestly win an election in 2004. I have not been to Seattle to spend a dime since. That area - Seattle and even Bellevue - is worse than NYC. In the latter case, people for the most part believe in God and acknowledge right and wrong even if they don't live it, but the Pacific Northwest's urban and suburban areas lie covered with a cloud of active hostility to anything good and right. It's a different, more ominous, more evil form of leftist ideology.
