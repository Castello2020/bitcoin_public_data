Problem is, the Feds money scheme is falling apart.
That’s why they are passing these draconian laws.
That’s why, at every step, they are encouraging people to get federal “Benefits”, food stamps for illegal aliens, etc. The more people they have dependent on the federal checks, the less opposition they think they will get.
So lots of people who realize it are sittin around waitin for the fat lady...
It’s gonna be interesting!

One of the “collapse” scenarios includes the idea that the feds just won’t have the resources to enforce their dictates in all places, and certain jurisdictions are going to simply ignore those dictates.

The fat lady is four hundred pounds plus and I hear her tuning up. When she is ready there will only be one tune she keeps repeating, “It’s All Over but the Cryin” and it will sound like Patsy Cline singing a funeral dirge.
