Twitter Account Gets Scrubbed In Zimmerman Case: sanitizes postings of teenage prosecution witness
The Smoking Gun ^

JUNE 26--In a late-night scrubbing spree, dozens of embarrassing and incriminating posts were deleted Tuesday evening from the Twitter account of a Florida woman who has been described as a star government witness in the George Zimmerman murder case, The Smoking Gun has learned. The sanitizing of Rachel Jeantels Twitter account came as the 19-year-old Miami resident prepares to take the stand and testify about a phone call she had with Trayvon Martin immediately before the unarmed 17-year-old was shot to death by Zimmerman in February 2012. As TSG reported yesterday, Jeantel, pictured above, maintains a Twitter account (@MsRachel_94) to which she has made more than 200 posts over the past five months. Many of the teenagers tweets referred to drinking, smoking, and getting high. She also made references to Martins death, referred to acquaintances as bitch and nigga, and wrote about having jackass lawyers on my ass. Yesterday afternoon, after TSG sought to contact several of Jeantels Twitter followers and Facebook friends, 14 tweets--and 13 linked Twitpic photos--were deleted from her Twitter account

I don’t know anybody that stays on the phone 12 hours in a day and says their just friends. That won’t fly in my book. The Fox reporter should wait until she hears both sides of the testimony before giving her take. She’s black and makes it appear she wants Zimmerman hanged.

I watched this witness on the stand today...SMH...when defense attorney West asked her if she had contacted LE about being the last person Martin talked to, her response was, “don’t you watch 48 Hours?...no I didn’t contact them...the first thing they do is check phone numbers...I was waiting for them to call me...when they didn’t call and I heard someone had been arrested, I thought it was over”...absolutely pathetic!!

48 hours? Isn’t that on TV? I thought she said she doesn’t watch TV?

I can’t get enough of her. This is too funny. You can’t make this stuff up, there is a God. And He has a sense of humor. This is better than HBO!
But HE didn’t create her to be a witness.

WHAT!
The fun has just begun
Anyone following the case should local Orlando feeds....The Conservative Tree House has links to the sites.
Orlando media is really beginning to turn on the state. The Black Racist National Media seems more intent on leading the riots
Wonder if Dee Dee even shows tomorrow

Too bad she can’t scrub that performance she gave today out of the memory of that jury.

I was waiting for them to call me...when they didnt call and I heard someone had been arrested, I thought it was over.The problem with that statement is that he was not "arrested" until 3 weeks after she got the call from Tracy. She's got her skittles mixed up.

Anyone notice this evening, how media is reporting her testimony. Trayvons comment was “creepy white ass cracker” they are bleeping it all out except for the word creepy. When she quotes Trayvon calling GZ a “nigga” they bleep that out and say he used a slang term. IS THIS JUST BS OR WHAT!

Just the weather, and The First 48, that’s all. Oh and per her scrubbed twitter feed, also “MTV Jams” and “Fix My Life” and a show about a pair of songwriters, and a Gospel show. That’s all. Probably.

I also learned today from the media that another word for “inarticulate” or “possibly mildly retarded” is “authentic”.

I would love to see the defense ask her, “Do you know who it is that has been deleting dozens of your Twitter postings over the past 48 hours?”

She’s not too smart if she doesn’t realize every post on her accounts has already been archived by many people already.
... and I’m not just talking about the NSA!
