Amnesty amounts to erasing the border for all intents and purposes.
It also legally recognizes a class of people who are NOT subject to the local laws. Whose whereabouts are unknown, whose background is unknown, whose intents are unknown, and whose allegiances are unknown.
The United States government continually proves that they are way, way, way more interested in knowing all they can find out about plain white guys who were born here, and they pretty much don’t give a rat’s rear about some faceless guy (MILLIONS of them) who just hopped, skipped, and jumped across the border.

Stop Amnesty.
Tell congressmen we dont want ANY bill passed, no matter what they promise. This bill is Amnesty for 30 million illegals, and a 1000 page bill that brings in 80 million 3rd world immigrants. The bill will destroy the U.S. and will turn the USA into a socialist state as is the democrats/Obamas plan.

Please sign their petition to require the Speaker to honor the Hastert Rule! If the Senate passes an amnesty for illegal aliens, it will be important that the House refuses to pass any immigration legislation in 2013! Stop the amnesty legislation!
