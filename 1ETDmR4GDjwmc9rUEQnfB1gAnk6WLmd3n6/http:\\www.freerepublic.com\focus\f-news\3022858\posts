IRS officials aren�t cooperating in probes at top or bottom

WASHINGTON  Internal Revenue Service officials are not fully cooperating with efforts to learn who is responsible for targeting conservative groups, lawmakers learned Wednesday during the third and most tense, dramatic hearing on the scandal. First, the director of the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt organizations at the heart of the scandal invoked her constitutional Fifth Amendment right and refused to answer questions during an appearance before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.Then, a Treasury Department inspector general told the committee that IRS employees in the Cincinnati office that handled applications for tax-exempt designations were not being fully cooperative in the investigation. He said the IRS employees have stymied efforts to learn who developed the controversial questions asked of conservative groups. The inability to find out more about who authorized the special scrutiny of conservative groups frustrated lawmakers striving to find out more even as the IRS launches its own 30-day inquiry and the Justice Department is starting a criminal investigation. At the same time Wednesday, the White House press secretary acknowledged that there have been legitimate criticisms about the way he has explained what the administration knew about the scandal.

No problem. Now that it’s shown just what the IRS is capable of, get a sales tax and eliminate income tax and shrink the bureaucracy.

We should just assume Obama was behind it. If no one wants to talk, than the assumption stands.

Remember after 911 the government closed the airports for two days to revamp security. This time the government wants thirty days to investigate itself and develop an excuse to tell the People for the IRS criminal activity. The activity began in 2010. Anyone with a brain knows why and who set this as policy, and yes, this was/is policy.

They aren’t co-operating at all.
And it isn’t just the IRS.
It is essentially the entire government gone rogue, and it is flaunting the fact that no one can touch it right in our faces.
What’s more is that half the country foolishly supports this, and wrongly believes these people are on their side, but the fact of the matter is those people are being used as useful idiots. As long as they have something that is needed, a vote, then they will be catered to.
But once that vote is no longer needed, they will then be useless idiots, and they will be left to starve.
The news of the past few...days, months years, I don’t even know...has been very trying for me. It’s one thing after another, none of it good, expect the nice old lady who found her dog in the rubble, that was good.
But it feels like things are coming to some sort of point. If those in power are answerable to no one, then how can they be made to answer anything at all?
If a man is allowed to get away with anything he does, then what happens, for example, at the end of a man’s term and the beginning of another, someone says to the man, sir, your time is over it’s time to go, and the man says no, my time has just begun, it’s time for you to go?
I can just here a familiar voice on the radio saying the nation will not tolerate his being dragged from office, even if he is supposed to go, they just won’t, it’s not going to happen...
Maybe I am just on edge, maybe I have gone crazy, but these are trying times, and I fear that they have just begun.

An admittedly rough comparison to "striking" IRS officials, but this issue brings to mind President Reagan firing striking air traffic controllers. This week in history: Ronald Reagan fires 11,345 air traffic controllers

Yes, all roads lead to Obama. You can bet the top WH gave the go-ahead and probably created the idea for Valerie Jarrett’s retaliation.
And I’d be willing to submit at least a couple folks in the top of the DNC knew the strategy, especially since the Tea Party was targeted to swing and steal the election.
We have a political coup at the highest level here in America.
Impeach and imprison.

Whats truly dysfunctional is if this were a Republican admin then half the country would feel the same, only the other half.

you are correct. Maybe the realization is beginning to set in for many that thought 1 in 5 odds was on the low side. Now it becomes a few unanswered questions and where do the first sparks (the sparks are there) ignite the first fuses. Don’t know here ... just speculating.

On another thread some are totally trashing Rush.
What I hear Rush saying is not deserving of being trashed. I might not like it, or want to hear it, but if you listen closely to all of it and not just a few words by themselves, what he’s saying is, he doesn’t think the American people - the low information voter - will hold Obama accountable for anything.
Rush has this theory that Obama pretends to not really be in charge of anything that’s going wrong. And makes ignorant people think he’s trying to stop bad things and trying to fix what’s wrong. And he’s getting away with pretending that.
So Rush says, quit hoping Obama will be blamed, instead simply blame big government liberals and the Democrat party, which is true anyway. They ARE to blame, not just Obama.

Treat it like the festering pus pocket it is.Fire anyone even remotely connected with the wrongdoing, with the stipulation that they never have another government job. If that doesn't get all the corruption, cut out another chunk.

My concern is are we watching the imploding of our ‘entire’ government system? Not that we haven’t been aware of the corruption...but if someone wanted to bring down this country fast...make the people hate and despise their government so much they rise up against it entire....
Despite the corruption we NEED our government...if it falls you can be sure “something” will fill the void....like the International Global Governance they are attempting to position all nations for???????....now that’s a chilling thought!!!!
Sometimes I think all these scandals are part of their ploy.....look at all the eastern nations that have fallen....what did they do first...they riled up the nations ‘people’ to oppose their government.
I do not have a good feel about all this....

So Rush says, quit hoping Obama will be blamed, instead simply blame big government liberals and the Democrat party, which is true anyway. They ARE to blame, not just Obama. Absolutely true. And, in any case, Obama's not running in 2016. To oust Obama before then, we'd need 2/3 of the Senate. Not going to happen. And, even if it did, removing him would just put Plugs in charge of Supreme Court nominations. Of course, with 2/3 of Congress, we could just repeal his whole agenda while letting him stew in office until 20 January 2017.

Gummints like a toilet.
If you want it clean and sparkling, you gotta flush it once in a while.
The problem is that all we got is Democraps and Republiturds.
Just the same bullshit getting recycled over and over, same results.
We need new thinking more than we need the same old people who’ve been in the government now for what? 30 40 50 years?
And a TRUE patriotism. No more of the “I vuz jus doink my job” line.

I do not have a good feel about all this.... Am attempting to remain positive caww. Maybe, wrongly, have sensed some folks giving up. This is not the time to give up (imho) for my belief is we may still have an excellent chance to secure our nation. It appears we (the People) are beginning to get the attention of our representatives, but if the story-line is written and our representatives fail to represent the People (aka the Citizens) and instead represent other entities against the People it will be plain for all to see that are paying attention. If, as is being alleged our government is lost it will be made known our government is lost by the actions of our government but I do not sense our government is lost. Perhaps am too much of an optimist and have too much faith in the American People to allow our representatives to represent someone other than Americans. A point is coming, so in that thought of are the scandals a means to an end maybe is valid. I have to wonder though ... Is it not better the truth has been brought into the light rather the truth be hidden in the dark. Time always tells the tale. This time will be no different.

Another agency that needs to be investigated is the Department of Home Land Security with big sis Janet testifying before Congress if DHS targeted conservatives, patriots, vets as the IRS targeted conservative groups. Rep. Issa ? need to bring Janet before Congress and ask her if her agency DHS targeted conservative groups, patriots, and vets as the IRS targeted conservative groups.

You didn’t act when the Clintons were complicit in the murders of people. You didn’t act when Republicans made traitorous decisions. You didn’t act when more and more controlling laws were passed. Why are you upset about the IRS NOW? The camel is in the tent. Get used to it. You’re NOT going to change it.

Exactly. Boehner is already fumbling this away. He needs to send a rocket to the White Hut explaining that the fitness of the Obama IRS is currently being reviewed.
Anything less than full transparency NOW will cause a review by Congress of all statutory responsibilities of the IRS. Meaning, removal of the IRS from Obamacare is now on the table.
Let’s see how Team Kenya wants to play that in an election year.

I see no evidence that those people who voted for Obama are outraged in any way at all.
It would be nice if I did, but I don’t.
What I’ve seen is that they don’t know, they don’t care and some outright support it.

Can Obama or Congress shut down IRS completely?
Everyone would love that and more than most will thank the Democrats by electing D's in 2014.
Who doesn't hate the IRS?
Played right, could the Democrats win this? Would abolishing IRS be a feather in Obama's legacy....
