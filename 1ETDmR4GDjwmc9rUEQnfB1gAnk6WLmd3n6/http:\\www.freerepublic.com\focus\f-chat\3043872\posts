Every year, the online magazine Edge--the so-called smartest website in the world, helmed by science impresario John Brockman--asks top scientists, technologists, writers, and academics to weigh in on a single question. This year, that query was "What Should We Be Worried About?", and the idea was to identify new problems arising in science, tech, and culture that haven't yet been widely recognized. ... snip ...

I was particularly interested in the concept of "Black Swan Event".

I’m afraid of going to a website that makes me click through 150 items just to boost their hit count...
So I ain’t gonna do it.

I was very intrigued by this topic.
I went there and started reading the list. At first I was a bit impatient, but gradually I realized.
The “world’s smartest people” don’t appear to have a flipping clue.
Good grief.

I’m unsure of what you mean, the link takes you directly to the article ... I made sure of that before posting.
Perhaps you’re not scrolling down?

And this surprised you? Clearly you have not been paying good attention.
The world’s smartest people are here at Free Republic, ignore the others.

The Black Swan is a catastrophic event that we cannot anticipate because it goes against everything we have ever known to be true. But once it occurs, there is the tendency to believe that we should have seen of coming. Basically, a black swan is the unknown unknown that we cannot prepare for because we never see it coming.
Taleb says the 9/11 was such an event but many of my colleagues disagree because some of them did see 9/11 coming.
Spent many hours in my Risk Analysis class talking about black swans.

There were some interesting ones on the list, but there was a hell of a large number of contributors who I would not choose to pick up my garbage, but less designate them “smartest people on the planet”. Hence, many of the concerns are utter rubbish.

Not that I saw.
Only one seemed genuinely serious (to me, in a list of 150 things)
#27. That people will stop dying.
There was a funny one:
#148: Stupidity.
And one almost too true:
21. Not much. I ride motorcycles without a helmet.

Donald Rumsfeld caught a lot of flak about his known knowns, known unknowns and unknown unknowns remark, back in the Bush administration era. While it may have sounded somewhat awkward to laymen (for whom it was actually intended), it was an attempt to lay out a basic grid for threat assessment. Unknown unknowns would be a Black Swan event. No way to prepare, no way of really even knowing what hit you until you're well into the event or problem. Blindsided by something you couldn't even envision prior, more or less.

Three of them may have been aware of the Zimmermen show-trial:
12. That search engines will become arbiters of truth. —W. Daniel Hillis, physicist
34. The social media-fication of science writing. Michael I. Norton, Harvard Business School prof
(he should have said “everything” instead of limiting his remark to “scirncr eriting)
40. We need institutions and cultural norms that make us better than we tend to be. It seems to me that the greatest challenge we now face is to build them. Sam Harris, neuroscientist

What worries me most is that sometime in the future while I'm sleeping an agent from the government will inject me with something that will suppress all my worries. Then I will be happy and serene regardless of what is happening around me. That worries the begeezus out of me!

Great post, thanks. I also got bogged with interest at the second one down by Taleb who wrote “The Black Swan” and “Antifragile.”*
These all seem very interesting, and all seem worth reading through even is some are stupid and I disagree! This is a long and complicated compilation of essays, NOT just a slide show for clicks!
I think few if any Freepers here have actually read and thought about all of these 150 essays in the time since this article was posted on FR! (I am impressed by anyone who really did! Tell us so we can clap for you!) It’s the kind of long publication you pick at a little, or you work through.
You will learn on some...
You will get thinking practice on some...
You will get CRITICAL thinking practice on some that are stupid...
And on the things stupid, with which you disagree, you will learn the way that those people think, so you can be the opposition if it comes to that!
It is WAY less irksome to read this than reading posts at “DU” to keep up with the bad guys!

There is certainly no evidence at all that any organism ever evolved into another organism regardless of the period of time allowed for. Check this one out Douglas T. Kenrick believes that intelligence is the same as having a high level of education. Only an intellectual could honestly believe that. He also incorrectly interprets the reason why both Canada and America have the same IQ in their highest five % of the population 120+ , yet the lowest 5% of America is a full 5 pts lower than that of Canada's lowest 5%. 75 Vs 80. He links this to large families among poor people but doesn't old that the data may show a much less homogenized society in the U.S. with a large population of African and Native American descendants. Morons of intelligentsia, save us from the intelligent idiots!

Oh, I used the direct link from “Jim from C-Town” without thinking about it and did not realize that the original post is linked to a site that only SUMMARIZES the 150 points.
Y’all use the direct link (thanks to “Jim from C-Town”) if you want to read all the essays, and wonder what I was talking about immediately above.

I think “Black Swan Events” are so much BS - some intellectual’s attempt to make a name for himself by coming up with some new catchy concept he can obsess about with his chattering-class buddies - supposedly events that no one could have seen coming, in fact I think they’re often just issues no one wants to talk about until they come to a head - the big financial crash of 2008 was supposed to have been a Black Swan, but people as financially unschooled as me were asking years ago what was going to happen to all those ARM mortgages being given out to people who could barely afford them when their rates reset - but of course we weren’t permitted to talk about such things in public because that would have been “racist” or shown no respect for the poor - and of course we can’t talk about them today because we’d end up implicating half the ‘rat party in the reckless policies that brought on the collapse - I’d be much more worried about politicians and entertainment-intellectuals misleading the public than I would be about any “Black Swan”......

Taleb says the 9/11 was such an event but many of my colleagues disagree because some of them did see 9/11 coming. The problem here is that I've yet to see a dated publication prior to 9/11 warning of the danger of airliners being flown into skyscrapers. Somebody may indeed have foreseen this, but I suspect its mostly hindsight genius.The closest I've seen to prediction of this disaster was in a Tom Clancy novel, when a Japanese radical flies a plane into the Capitol during the State of the Union address. But that was a cargo plane.
