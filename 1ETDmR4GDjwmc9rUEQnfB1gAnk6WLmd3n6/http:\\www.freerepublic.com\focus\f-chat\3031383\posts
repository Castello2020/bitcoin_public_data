BOOZY JACKIE GLEASON WAS A LIVING HELL!

THE HONEYMOONERS cast was a marriage made in Heaven, but Jackie Gleasons drinking and bizarre habits turned some days into a living hell for his co-stars, reveals Joyce Randolph, the last surviving member of the legendary sitcoms cast. Working with Jackie was the toughest challenge an actress could face, the 88-year-old, who played Art Carneys TV wife Trixie Norton, reveals in an exclusive interview at her Manhattan apartment. You never knew what hed say or do. He often ad-libbed and you had to think lightning fast to keep the laughs coming. The classic show centered onthe antics of Big Apple bus driver Ralph Kramden (Gleason), his sewer worker pal Ed Norton (Carney) and their long-suffering wives Alice Kramden (Audrey Meadows) and Trixie. The programs 39 episodes ran from 1955 to 1956. Joyce says shed break into cold sweats of fear because Gleason, who died at age 71 in 1987, had a photographic memory and found the idea of rehearsing loathsome. He wanted everything fresh and spontaneous. We rehearsed behind his back with someone else reading his part. Performing live with him, we never knew what was going to happen next with him  but we neednt have worried. Jackie hardly looked at the script, and every line came out perfectly. You were always on your toes to keep up with him. Joyce says Gleason also was terribly moody. Hed be fun and charming one day, but the next hed be barking out orders as if he hated everyone! Tactfully speaking about Gleasons legendary thirst for alcohol, Joyce says she knew his coffee was often laced with whiskey, which affected his mood. After The Honeymooners, Joyce concentrated on her family. She and her wealthy marketing exec hubby Richard Charles, who died in 1997 at age 74, had one son, Randolph Charles, in 1960. Nowadays, I dont want to play old lady parts, Joyce says. Nor do they make shows like the Honeymooners anymore  so my acting career is definitely over. But not a day goes by that she doesnt think of her costars. Its hard to believe Im the last one left, says Joyce. I get quite tearful when I see re-runs of The Honeymooners. I still remember every line, every joke. Its still funny all these years later. Jackie Gleason was a comedic genius.

I was too young to watch "The Honeymooners" and when I later caught episodes it didn't appeal to me much. As far as this little girl is concerned, he was BORN to play this role: "My name is Sheriff Buford T. Justice and I am in HIGH SPEED PURSUIT !"

Alice and Norton were the stars of that show.Ralph was OK but only as the butt of the great lines from the real stars.

I was too young to watch "The Honeymooners" and when I later caught episodes it didn't appeal to me much. There are some shows geared toward men and others toward women.The Honeymooners is an example of the former.The Stooges and Married With Children are two others.It's understandable,to me at least,that you might not be impressed.

I used to love the Jackie Gleason Show. Crazy Guggenheim, The Poor Soul and young and upcoming comedians who are legends today.
They don’t make variety shows like that anymore.

Awwww...
The Honeymooners had heart, unlike so many mean-spirited shows today.
Trixie, you’re the greatest.
On another note, Art Carney was the greatest slapstick comedian of all time, although “Kramer” is a close second. Whaddaya say, Ralphie boy?

He was a man of many talents! Played so many roles, but was a fantastic musician, arranger, composer and band leader. I suspect he handled much of the finances and promotion.
In some ways Steve Allen came close.

so....the National Enquirer sends someone around to pester an 88 year old woman about somebody she worked with six decades ago, and after some prodding she says some mildly critical things about the man (who is LONG DEAD) which allows them to run a SCREAMING HEADLINE that he was a BOOZER FROM HELL?
What absolute human scumbags!

He was exceptional. I cannot forget the way he loosened up his hands to play the opening measure of Old Folks at Home when Ralph was going on the $99,000 Answer, or his stint as the Chef of the Past. Good stuff.

I know nothing of his other interests but have heard of his band leader work so it's obvious that at least some people (if not many) thought he did well,as do you. He had a series of "mood music" albums, where he would hum or sing the basic tune, and have composers flesh out the arrangements (Gleason couldn't read music). Those albums made him a fortune. Gleason's personall life has been well documented, so this is not breaking news, and Randolph says nothing that is not already very public knowledge.

It's true, it's true. Except in those days they were called wetbacks, and you could eat Fritos and still snicker. This was in the days before someone shot Mary Rose Wilcox, Maricopa County Senora and county board of supervisors member, in her buttocks grandissimo.

Jackie Gleason produced, directed, collaborated on the writing, and even created the famous theme music for the show. He allowed his two principal costars to shine and himself played the braggart, the fool, the tightwad, and the frustrated working class stiff whose idiot friend and upstairs neighbor Norton and his wife Trixie seemed to have all the comforts of (1950's) modern apartment living, or as you put it the "butt" of all those great lines.

Yes I forgot about that. He was like...the Italian composer in the spaghetti westerns who couldn’t read music so worked with musicians who could put his ideas on paper.
It also ocvurs to me it has been reported many times he was a heavy drinker and womanizer. Wasn’t there a scandal or bruhaha over JG and the June Taylor Dancers?

A bit off topic, sorry, but your post reminded me of these movies.
If you haven’t seen “Harry and Tonto” or “Going in Style” with Art Carney, do check them out.
Both are classics!!
