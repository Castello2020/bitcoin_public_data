<p><img src="http://ap.lanexdev.com/user_images/image/rr/2012/Abiogenesis-is-Irrelevant-to-Evolution--JM2.jpg" /><p>(article photo) The Law of Biogenesis tells us that in nature, life comes only from life of its kind (Miller, 2012). Therefore, abiogenesis (i.e., life arising from non-living materials) is impossible, according to the scientific evidence. How then can atheistic theories like Darwinian evolution be considered acceptable? There is a growing trend among evolutionists today to attempt to sidestep the problem of abiogenesis by contending that evolution has nothing to do with the origin of life, but rather is a theory which starts with life already in existence and explains the origin of all species from that original life form. However, this approach is merely wishful thinking&#151;an effort to avoid the logical import of the Law of Biogenesis. <p>Historically, evolutionists have recognized that abiogenesis is a fundamental assumption inherent in evolutionary theory, and intuitively must be so. In 1960, British evolutionary physiologist, G.A. Kerkut, listed abiogenesis as the first assumption in a list of non-provable assumptions upon which evolution is founded. &#147;The first assumption is ........<br clear="all" /></p>

    <p>Why is it so hard to understand that evolution is a theory on how organisms change and adapt after they already exist. How life came to exist is a separate question entirely. Obviously things like natural selection cannot occur before life begins, just like you cannot tune an engine before an engine exists.</p>

    Whatever Darwin said is actually irrelevant. Clark had not yet discovered DNA. BTW, we now refer to nano particles ~ DNA is down there at that size ~ and recently a 5th dimension may have been discovered that reveals itself only with nano particles, or smaller.<p>Darwin didn&#39;t know that either, but neither did Clark.<p>That 5th dimension probably has a lot to do with genetics.

    <p>Darwin said directly that he had no idea how life originated but proposed a theory about how it evolved. If Miller can&#8217;t get something so easily verifiable right I&#8217;m not inclined to listen to much else he has to say. There are research standards, you know.</p>

    If modern science limits itself to those things that can be empirically known, then the study of life must be done within certain parameters. One would have to make the case that all of the diversity of life is made possible through Evolution and genetic drift. <p> If, however, a curious bit of evidence were to surface, and someone were to say &quot;Perhaps we need to broaden our view in order to explain this ...&quot; The strict materialist will shut that conversation down -- no broader view is needed. Get a better microscope. Find new techniques. Empirical evidence is all we will ever need. By definition of what &quot;science&quot; is.<p> On the other hand, if we look at the origin of life and conclude that something &quot;other&quot; had to play a role, then we open the door to further exploration of other aspects of biology and the possibility that something beyond the empirical world could be considered, and might not be inappropriate.<p> Science is either 100% materialistic, or it&#39;s not. The pure evolutionists are counting on it being 100% materialist. The folks with Faith are willing to accept a material solution for much, but not all, that we see around us.<p> I&#39;m not narrow-minded: I live in a world of both Faith and Science.

    The fact that the best science can come up with is that we started out as a single life form that through random mutation and natural selection brought us to what we see today reveals that we have absolutely no clue what really happened.<br />
 <br />It may be that homo sapiens simply do not possess the intellect necessary to determine what happened in any specific or detailed way.

    <p>long-term evolution experiments do not show major evidence for macroevolutionary change (Behe, 2010). Perhaps the more important point has to do with the types of changes that can be expected. As one geneticist argued in a recent book, mutations cause the decay of the &#147;message&#148; of the genome rather than the formation of new information (Sanford, 2008). A summary of long-term evolution experiments also suggests that even mutations considered &#147;beneficial&#148; (for the organism) in these studies generally involved the loss of genetic information (Behe, 2010).</p>

    <p>&#8220;Therefore, abiogenesis (i.e., life arising from non-living materials) is impossible, according to the scientific evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not true, according to the scientific evidence. While the individual asserting this is a mechanical and biomechanical engineer, his expertise is not in genetics or biology.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the famous Miller-Urey experiment of 1952.</p>
<p>It was was an experiment that simulated the conditions thought at the time to be present on the early Earth, and tested for the occurrence of chemical origins of life.</p>
<p>in 2007, scientists examining sealed vials preserved from the original experiments were able to show that there were actually well over 20 different amino acids produced in Miller&#8217;s original experiments. That is considerably more than what Miller originally reported, and more than the 20 that naturally occur in life.</p>
<p>Moreover, some evidence suggests that Earth&#8217;s original atmosphere might have had a different composition from the gas used in the Miller&#150;Urey experiment.</p>
<p>There is abundant evidence of major volcanic eruptions 4 billion years ago, which would have released carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Experiments using these gases in addition to the ones in the original Miller&#150;Urey experiment have produced even more diverse molecules. Meteorites have been found to contain over 90 different amino acids, nineteen of which are found in Earth life.</p>
<p>So how do amino acids become life? By joining together.</p>
<p>When a few amino acids join together, which happens spontaneously, they form peptides. And peptides act as the &#8220;glue&#8221; that hold chains of amino acids together forming proteins, a class of molecules. And primitive proteins can replicate themselves.</p>
<p>An example of this process today are &#8220;prions&#8221;, like &#8220;Mad Cow disease&#8221;, in which a corrupted protein can make other, similar, proteins modify themselves to become corrupt as well. This happens at even a smaller scale than the tiniest viruses.</p>
<p>Eventually, proteins become so complex they become RNA, which encapsulates itself to effectively become a virus. Still questionable if it can be called &#8220;alive&#8221; yet.</p>
<p>However, this is pretty much the start of evolution. As viruses became more complicated, the eventual result was the three &#8220;domains&#8221; of life. The simplest of these are the Archaea, which look like bacteria but are much simpler, and have a completely different evolutionary path.</p>
<p>They are so simple that these microbes have no cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles within their cells. An organelle is is a specialized subunit within a cell that has a specific function, and it is usually separately enclosed. Thus Archaea are so simple that they consume &#8220;raw materials&#8221; like hydrogen gas.</p>
<p>Next up, in a huge leap of complexity, are the bacteria, whose RNA has become complex enough to be DNA, which reproduce by dividing themselves, forming near identical nuclei and organelles, over and over again. But they still retain their individuality as single celled organisms.</p>
<p>Finally, when bacteria started to band together, with groups of them performing specialized functions, the final domain of evolution was created, the eukaryotes, which includes all plants and animals other than bacteria and Archaea.</p>
<p>So if you look at a human, their cells could be described as groups of bacteria that specialized into organs, and whose DNA is the same in all their cells, which assures that they reproduce almost identically to their parents.</p>
<p>The split between the animal and plant kingdom was simple enough. The plants adopted a hard shell for their cells, but animals still use soft cells.</p>

    <p>The only reason evolutionists are claiming this today is that they&#8217;ve been unsuccessful &#151; without massive intervention by intelligent design provided by abiogenesis researchers themselves in the laboratory &#151; in demonstrating how a living, self-replicating organisms (such as a cell) could have formed by itself, by means of purely physical forces, plus lots of time.</p>
<p>The two best books on this subject are long out of print but still available if you search for them: &#8220;The Mystery of Life&#8217;s Origin: Reassessing Current Theories&#8221; by Charles Thaxton, et al.; and &#8220;The Creation of Life: A Cybernetic Approach to Evolution&#8221; by A. E. Wilder Smith. Among other things, they both show that all theories of abiogenesis violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics, as well as violating its statistical-mechanics interpretation (i.e., left to themselves, systems always move from configurations of lower probability to configurations of higher probability; that&#8217;s why things decay; that&#8217;s why a nice straight wall made of brick and mortar (a low-probability configuration for clay and mortar to take) always, over time, turns into one of many possible piles of rubble (one of many high-probability configurations clay and mortar can take). I&#8217;ve never seen any intelligible response from abiogenesis enthusiasts to this objection.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are mathematical coding-theory objections to many abiogenesis scenarios: i.e., since 64 possible codons in DNA/RNA represent, or map to, 20 amino acids that build various proteins, the 64-symbol alphabet must precede the 20-symbol alphabet; i.e., you can map 64 symbols onto 20 symbols (with redundancy), but you cannot map 20 symbols onto 64 symbols (without ambiguity, which is the death of the code system). So a &#8220;proteins-first&#8221; scenario is mathematically impossible; i.e., DNA would (mathematically) have to have appeared first, followed by protein synthesis. The problem here, however, is the DNA itself requires the environment of a pre-existing cell (with all of its proteins) in order to function. I&#8217;ve never heard any intelligible response by abiogenesis enthusiasts to this chicken-egg paradox between DNA and proteins.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s another basic coding-theory problem that remains unsolved by abiogenesis: in order for a code to function as a code, both the sender and receiver must have PRIOR knowledge of what the code means, i.e., what the code is supposed to code for, and how it is supposed to be decoded. In the case of the living cell, both the DNA molecule and the ribosome must have &#8220;communicated&#8221; with each other in the distant past in order for both of them to &#8220;understand&#8221; the same code, i.e., that 64 possible 3-letter arrangements of nucleotides represent 20 possible amino acids that can be combined into many different polypeptide (proteins). This, too, remains unsolved... and perhaps unsolvable by purely naturalistic, material explanations.</p>

    <p>Darwin is not a god. (do not be insulted) The followers of Darwinism do believe in Abiogenesis, (if asked and if they are honest, except theistic evolutionist, who believe in supernatural inference.)</p>
<p>Further in article;</p>
<p>&#8220;..The truth is, one cannot logically commence a study of Life Science or Biology&#151;studies which are intimately linked with the theory of evolution by the bulk of the scientific community today&#151;without first studying the origin of that life which allegedly evolved from a single-celled organism into the various forms of life on Earth today. Biology and Life Science textbooks today, with almost unanimity, include a discussion of biogenesis, abiogenesis (ironically, discussing the work of Pasteur, Spallanzani, and Redi, who disproved the theory of abiogenesis), and extensive discussions of evolutionary theory. The evolutionists themselves inevitably couple Biology and Life Science with evolution, as though they are one and the same. But a study of life&#151;biology&#151;must have a starting point....&#8221;<br />

However, their experiment was carried out in the absence of oxygen (something even evolutionists now admit does not reflect the early Earth&#146;s atmosphere), because they knew that oxygen quickly would oxidize any amino acids that were formed&#151;thereby preventing the formation of anything living.</p>

    <p>They may have used that term, but all it shows is that they are idiots.</p>
<p>Darwinian Evolution explains (or tries to) exactly what Darwin said, the Origin of Species, not the origin of life. How one organism develops into others.</p>
<p>Evolution, as such, has exactly zero to say about the origin of life, and less than that about physics and the Big Bang.\</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always thought it highly amusing that some use the Big Bang Theory to &#8220;prove&#8221; the Bible is wrong and God doesn&#8217;t exist. Whereas the theory is just a restatement of Genesis 1:1, with a creator added. Suddenly the heavens and the earth came into existence.</p>

    <p>I don&#8217;t have to prove anything.</p>
<p>All it takes is a belief that one in a thousand (or one in a million or one in a billion just pick a number) mutations give a survival advantage to the organism.</p>
<p>Remember something:<br />
Darwins ideas have to do with survival of the fittest, not evolution as we see it today. Darwins ideas were proposed in the late 1800&#8217;s, almost a hundred years before DNA was even discovered.</p>
<p>It is kind of in hindsight that we see how DNA might relate to species variation.<br />
And as I implied in my original post, evolution CAN explain differences between species and even differences between members of the same species.</p>
<p>But what evolution CANNOT explain is how it all got started.</p>

    <p>Correct re: viruses, they have DNA (or RNA) but lack the transcription factors they need to reproduce.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s the rub:<br />
How could a cell that doesn&#8217;t have the transcription factors reproduce and somehow carry on its (non-existent) transcription factors?</p>
<p>How can a cell that REQUIRES a sodium-potassium pump pass on a sodium-potassium pump to it&#8217;s offspring if it doesn&#8217;t already have it in the DNA?</p>
<p>It can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Life is a very complex process with multiple dependent systems.</p>
<p>Most of those systems could not have evolved independently, because in the absence of life, what we call a system is a mini-molecular machine that, without life, wouldn&#8217;t do a single thing of any consequence.</p>
