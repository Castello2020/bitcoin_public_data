Climate slowdown means extreme rates of warming 'not as likely'

Since 1998, there has been an unexplained "standstill" in the heating of the Earth's atmosphere. Writing in Nature Geoscience, the researchers say this will reduce predicted warming in the coming decades. But long-term, the expected temperature rises will not alter significantly. The slowdown in the expected rate of global warming has been studied for several years now. Earlier this year, the UK Met Office lowered their five-year temperature forecast. But this new paper gives the clearest picture yet of how any slowdown is likely to affect temperatures in both the short-term and long-term. An international team of researchers looked at how the last decade would impact long-term, equilibrium climate sensitivity and the shorter term climate response. Transient nature Climate sensitivity looks to see what would happen if we doubled concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere and let the Earth's oceans and ice sheets respond to it over several thousand years. Transient climate response is much shorter term calculation again based on a doubling of CO2. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported in 2007 that the short-term temperature rise would most likely be 1-3C (1.8-5.4F). But in this new analysis,

One has to love the term “unexplained”. Kind of like “unexpected” we see so often in articles from liberals. Hahahaha.

Earlier this year, the UK Met Office lowered their five-year temperature forecast. A marvelous thing indeed. They can't predict, with any accuracy, what the temperature will be next week but yet know what it will be in 5 years.

I guess you missed the recent NASA report that proved CO2 is absolutely necessary to protect the Earth by reflecting most of the Sun’s energy back into space. Now that NASA has blown away the CO2 warming theory, you can pick something else to worry about. Did I make your day or what? I know it’s not like you won the lottery but global warming isn’t. Rejoice!

I was driving through Southern Oregon not long ago and couldn’t pick up anything but NPR, so I braced myself and listened to it for a while.
Every episode, every show, was about global warming or the environment. You’d think the planet was on its death bed thanks to humans.

This “study” is complete drivel and uses the usual modus operandi for climate science: massage data to fit theory and when it can no longer be massaged to fit, then adjust the theory slightly but keep massaging like crazy. At some point in the next decade or two the global temperature will start to significantly decline using the reliable measurements (e.g. satellite). The warmists will add more “man’s fault” aerosols to their models or come up with something new. They may even say “we are lucky that nature is helping us temporarily,...” But it will be over except for the lies (e.g. urban heated thermometers, cooling of past readings, etc)

I guess you missed the recent NASA report that proved CO2 is absolutely necessary to protect the Earth by reflecting most of the Suns energy back into space In the interst of making sure the lurkers know that we've got our facts straight, I will point out that Earth's atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other (0.9% argon, 0.037% carbon dioxide), though at lower the lower altitudes water vapor can make up as much as 5% of total volume. The atmosphere as a whole reflects ultra violet radiation, with CO2 playing only a minor role in that process.

Since 1998, there has been an unexplained standstill in the heating of the Earths atmosphere. Maybe because of this..... and...... (PhysOrg.com) -- Sunspot formation is triggered by a magnetic field, which scientists say is steadily declining. They predict that by 2016 there may be no remaining sunspots, and the sun may stay spotless for several decades. The last time the sunspots disappeared altogether was in the 17th and 18th century, and coincided with a lengthy cool period on the planet known as the Little Ice Age. and....in December of 1776...some big ice blocks afloat...

You know I felt like I was the only old fart (’m 81) who was hearing this krap. It would be interesting to see if there was a message of record (email or other directive) that came from on high to push this and I bet there was. But the fun would be to expose it.
State and federal legislators can hold hearings and ask those questions when it comes to defunding...But they have to cite specific questions. In this Sundays case all they need do is review recordings of those broadcasts.

In other words, the climate is following 1000’s of years worth of cyclical warmign and cooling trends- gee- whoda thunk it?
But once again we see ‘climatologists’ ‘predicting’ a new direction when the wind changes direction and claimign they were right all along - no matter which way the wind blows, these Hindsight ‘scientists’ are covered- it’s all man’s fault-

It must be like a bad cartridge. The trigger is pulled, but it hasn’t gone bang yet.
Does it fire? Does it eventually fire, but only go an inch down the barrel?
Or does it never fire, and you just throw it away?

I don’t think they need to send messages from on high - they do something even more effective (from their point of view) - they put true believer as announcers and let them do their things. Similar to terrorist cells.

That’s incorrect. Based on the NASA report, CO2 plays a much more important part in preventing the Sun from raising temperatures on Earth than previously known The other question is given the greater percentage and effectiveness of water as a so-called greenhouse gas, why have the scammers focused on a relatively insignificant gas, CO2. The answer to that is obvious. CO2 was looked upon as the next best thing for diverting money from the private sector to government. Fortunately the research continued and CO2 has been proven not to be the fearsome planet changing boogey man as was widely promoted.

The slowdown in solar activity kicked in around 2007-8. It is still too early to see much effect from this. As usual there is thermal inertia from the ocean, remaining ocean warmth from the high solar period (up to the 90’s) has been delaying the impact of lower solar activity.

The focus on CO2 made the models simpler. Considering that they don't model weather, it's hard for them to judge the effects of solar and terrestrial factors on climate. Specifically, if water vapor is evenly distributed (fewer storms and/or weaker storms, stronger polar jet, less meridional flow, etc) then there will be global warming. Conversely having more and stronger storms (worldwide), weak jet with blocking (e.g. causing heat waves or flooding) produces global cooling. None of that can be modeled without modeling the small scale convective processes, and the climate models do not do that (even weather models suck at that). Thus they basically do a large scale energy balance model so things like CO2 get undo emphasis and water vapor is ignored (i.e. they keep constant RH without any justification).
