It must be kind of fun for her to be at the receiving end of that kind of presidential gaffe.

He meant to say she is a credit to her race, which is how she got her job, I imagine.

It’s part of the plan; too many folks were catching on to Soetoro’s homosexuality, so his handlers engineered a false flag sexual harassment incident..

Liberal 0dumnb0 apologizing to another liberal, California Attorney General Kamala Harris. Now that's something that would never happen if a liberal was apologizing for smearing & insulting a conservative. Then it's usually a qualified apology...."if you were offended, then I apologize". Most likely 0dumb0 was trying to hit up on her, and got called out by some of the liberal media. The rest of the liberal media was defending 0dumb0's remarks. The thing that I look forward to, is for "single parent" moochelle to open up a giant can of whoopass on her effeminate hubby 0dumb0 when he returns. I bet $100 he is sleeping for the next couple of nights in the Oval office just to get away from phat ass moooochelle.

So,,, now he’s saying she’s NOT good looking?? So Obama is saying she’s ugly, and probably thinks her ass is fat too!
If he was a heterosexual, he’d know you can’t escape by just apologizing to a woman and then everything is OK. But he wouldn’t know that.

I wonder if the real purpose of Zer0’s comments about Kamala Harris’ beauty was to deflect suspicion away from rumors about his sexual orientation.

There are no accidents, or darned few. One suspects that Mister Obama planned, rehearsed, and performed the statement; and, then the "news"-making apology. There are no accidents, (or darned few.).

Obama Apologized To California's Kamala Harris For Calling Her The 'Best-Looking Attorney General Valerie Jarret must have jumped his ass that it wasn't "politically correct" to say such a thing and he's now apologizing.

Now I know he’s a fag.
I don’t care for her views but, that wouldn’t stop me from buying her a drink.
She’s dang’d purdy.
I’d never apologize for calling out beauty.

Who the hell cares what she looks like? I'd still admire Governor Palin if she looked like Rosie O’Donuts and I'd still despise Rosie if she looked like Governor Palin.
