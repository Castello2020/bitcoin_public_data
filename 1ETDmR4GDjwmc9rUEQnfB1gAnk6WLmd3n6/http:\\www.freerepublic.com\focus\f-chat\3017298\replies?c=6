I thought the same thing. Wasn't Marilyn Monroe a size 12? My daughter is a 4-6 and my niece is a 00 (yes Size double zero!) They don't even like the clothe at A&F. I believe one of nieces friends called it “skank central”. (Direct quote) And just because you don't make a size higher then 10 doesn't mean people don't wear your clothes. I've been to the mall and to high school and there are people wearing clothes that don't fit. You aren't a Size 4 because you squeeze your butt into a Size 4! I am not considered “plus size” but I'd rather see a larger person wearing proper fitting clothes then smaller people squeezing into clothes to try to “fit in”. ‘Cuz they don't “fit in”.

Marylin Monroe was one of the most beautiful women of all time.
But no way, in nobodies book, would she be called “petite”!

Marilyn Monroe need not apply.snopes: In 2009, fashion features editor Sara Buys had an opportunity to try on some items from a collection of Marilyn Monroes costumes and clothes and reported: Contrary to received wisdom, she was not a voluptuous size 16 — quite the opposite. While she was undeniably voluptuous — in possession of an ample bosom and a bottom that would look at home gyrating in a J-Lo video — for most of the early part of her career, she was a size 8 and even in her plumper stages, was no more than a 10. I can tell you this from experience because a few weeks ago, I tried to try on her clothes. 91 posted on 05/09/2013 7:33:18 AM PDT by PapaBear3625
