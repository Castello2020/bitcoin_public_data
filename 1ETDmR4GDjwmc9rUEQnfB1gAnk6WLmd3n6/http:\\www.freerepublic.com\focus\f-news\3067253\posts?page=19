The White House said Saturday U.S. President Barack Obama will speak next week about economic growth following the worst recession since the Great Depression. In a statement, the White House said the president will speak Monday in the Rose Garden to discuss "the progress we have made to grow the economy and create 7.5 million private sector jobs, and highlight the work we still need to do to strengthen the middle class and those fighting to get into it." The statement said Obama will "highlight his better bargain for the middle class, and warn against more self-inflicted wounds from Washington." The president will be joined at the White House by people the statement said "have benefited from his economic recovery proposals over the last five years including small business owners, construction workers, homeowners, consumers and tax cut recipients."

Can’t he just shut up? Every time he opens his mouth, consumer confidence takes a hit.

for goodness’ sakes!
he just keeps returning to things he’s messed up
(but shows no signs of ever learning anything from all the experience)
hasn’t he done enough damage already?

“strengthen the middle class “
really? I can’t name one piece of legislation or any type of executive order that this administration has proposed that is for the middle class.
more welfare, food stamps, free cell phones, free medical care, higher taxes etc etc etc, does not strengthen the middle class.

We have lived in the bubble for so long we don’t know anything else.... the credit/debt bubble is going to blow up sooner or later. Smart people understand this and prepare. The majority believe the media and are more comfortable living in the illusion.
The housing bubble was simply the first implosion and more will follow - our banksters are out of borrowed bullets and there is little they can do. The people want theirs and our leaders won’t tell us the truth. They will keep kicking the can right into the wall of reality few observe. It’s not going to be pretty. That’s my .02.

Maybe he will talk up all that money that was poured into solar energy, or blame Bush for the 311th time, or maybe talk about great things to come.
Economy-wise, in twenty years...I don’t think any economic expert will give this administration much of a positive spin. Historians might try various spins, but we are in the midst of a depression. It may not be the 1930’s style...but the nation is sitting and spinning its wheels. There is no movement.
I’d like to see the Business Channel take some guy on the road to small towns across the US, and talk to real people...instead of news journalists. We might be shocked to see that things are fairly stagnant in the heartland.

“What’s he going to say? Shut up and take it?”
I think that will be the subject of TOTUS...that I have no intention of watching. It will be made in the Rose Garden...that’s so sweet.
I did watch the other night when he strode purposefully up to the podium to talk about Syria and then did a “fade away” when he walked away.
I only watch when I think he might have something important to say...like we are going to war. The rest is just blah-blah-blah.

Other when it's scripted, as above, just when has Mister Obama been a true and genuine fan of promoting the private sector or the middle class? (I'd love to be wrong, corrections invited.).

President Obama has averaged an approval rating of 49.0% throughout his first four and a half years in office, putting his average approval under Richard Nixon (49.1%) and George W. Bush (49.4%). Historical Gallup Poll approval highs and lows for each President since 1937

Cant he just shut up? Every time he opens his mouth, consumer confidence takes a hit. It's a matter of timing. Consumer confidence needs to hit a nadir in late October of next year. Those low-information pukes need to be really worried!

It was really easy to guess where this presidency would end up the night he was first elected.
What I didn’t guess was how easily he would be able to mask this horrendous economy.
He hasn’t created anything but handouts.

Historians might try various spins, but we are in the midst of a depression.After what I've learned about FDR in the past 5 years I really doubt this. There is no way FDR should get credit for ending the Depression. It amazes me how he did get away with it. He got away with it because liberal progressives control education and got to write the history on it.I just can't wait (sarcasm) for my daughter to come home from school when she is about 17 years old to tell me about how their teacher said Obama saved us, or it wasn't his fault because blah blah blah blah.
