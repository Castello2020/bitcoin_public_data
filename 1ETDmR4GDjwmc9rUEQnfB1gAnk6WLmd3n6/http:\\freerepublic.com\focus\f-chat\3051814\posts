<p>Women taking drugs known as calcium channel blockers (CCBs) for high blood pressure and other health conditions may be at higher risk for breast cancer if the drug is used long-term, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). <p>The finding is particularly important because so many people take drugs to lower blood pressure. It&#146;s also important because studies about risk of breast cancer from the drugs that are the most commonly prescribed medication in the U.S. have yielded inconsistent results. <p>Christopher I. Li, M.D., Ph.D., of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle and colleagues found taking calcium channel blockers for more than 10-years was associated with higher odds of ductal breast cancer.<p>

 <p>The analysis comes from a population based study that included women ages 55 to 74 years from the three county metropolitan Seattle-Puget Sound regions.<p>The researchers looked at the women&#146;s breast cancer risk and use of the blood pressure medications, finding higher odds of the disease with 10 or more years of use. <p>Patricia F. Coogan, Sc.D., of the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/slone/" rel="nofollow">Slone Epidemiology Center at Boston University</a>, wrote in a commentary to the sutdy that though the finding is observational and doesn&#39;t show calcium channel blockers cause breast cancer, there would be public health implications, if it&#146;s true. <p>The study authors say more research is needed to confirm the finding and to understand how the medications could lead to breast cancer.<p>She says it doesn&#39;t mean women should stop taking their blood pressure medications, but says the finding is&#147;&#133; valid evidence supporting the hypothesis that long-term CCB use increases the risk of breast cancer.&#148; Coogan suggests the study also doesn&#39;t mean clinicians should change their prescribing practice.<p>Coogan also notes if the drugs do boost the risk of ductal cancer in-situ, avoiding CCBs could be a &quot;major&quot; modifiable risk for breast cancer. <p>If you are taking a calcium channel blocker for blood pressure, speak with your doctor about the findings. Examples of the medications include nifedipine, amlodipine (Norvasc) and diltiazem. Sometimes the drugs are also prescribed for migraine headache and Reynaud&#146;s disease because they dilate the arteries. Physicians also prescribe the medications to reduce the workload of the heart for people with coronary artery disease who are prone to chest pain or angina. <p><a href="http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1723871" rel="nofollow">The finding </a>is not the first to link calcium channel blockers to risk of breast cancer. For now, we don&#39;t know if the drugs do or do not cause cancer of the breast. The best advice for women is to keep up with your breast cancer screening until more studies are done. Of course, if the finding is true, it wouldn&#39;t be the first time a medication side effect has been discovered years after it has been on the market.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <p>Calcium channel blockers have also been considered for male birth control and can have adverse effects on the male anatomy. Too bad they are also extremely effective on blood pressure especially when nothing else works.</p>

    <p>Cardiologist had me on Norvasc and ten other meds after a heart attack in Oct. 2012. Norvasc made me feel like crap. Legs felt like they weighed a ton, light headed, and no energy. I was having panic attacks too, but not sure it was related to the Norvasc. Threw them in the garbage along with the Coreg he prescribed. Have been holding off on taking Lipitor for the last couple of weeks.<br />
Some days are still a struggle, but feel much better without them.</p>

    Ask your doctor if you can take smaller doses or get time release formulations. And there is always losing weight if that&#39;s an issue and avoiding sodium. You don&#39;t want to get heart failure. <p> These blood pressure drugs decrease the workload on the heart, and allow it to remodel and become stronger. The downside is that initially they can reduce cardiac output and make you feel weaker. It&#39;s a strategy that works, though. <p> Back in the old days they would do the opposite and give drugs that would make the heart work harder. You&#39;d feel better, but the downside is you&#39;d be dead in a couple of years.

    Mr. Lott maybe you would be interested in this question. Could the disparity in survival between black and white women with breast cancer be explained by prior abortions and/or long term use, ten years or more, of calcium channel blockers? According to the second link in comment# 1: &quot;These differences in survival appear primarily related to presentation characteristics at diagnosis rather than treatment differences.&quot;<p><a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/3038634/posts?page=14#14" target="_blank">Indian study: Abortion raises breast cancer risk over 6-fold</a><p><a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/3051493/posts" target="_blank">Researchers Identify New Source of Powerful Immunity Protein</a><p><a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/3051383/posts" target="_blank">Synthetic molecule chokes TB growth - Compound acts by novel mechanism and is effective in mice.</a><p><a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/3051837/posts" target="_blank">The brain&#39;s GPS: Researchers discover human neurons linked to navigation in open</a><p><b>FReepmail</b> me if you want on or off my health and science ping list.

    <p>Thanks Moonman62 for the info. I did take smaller doses and took extended release meds after talking to the Doc. I have also cut out most salt and pork. My job requires lots of walking and physical movement, so the weakness was causing me to not be able to perform my duties at 100%. I&#8217;m researching herbs such as COQ10, Flaxseed and Cholestoff as alternatives. Kava-Kava seems to help with the days I feel jittery. Thanks again.</p>
