Obama Apologized To California's Kamala Harris For Calling Her The 'Best-Looking Attorney General

President Barack Obama called California Attorney General Kamala Harris from Air Force One Thursday to apologize for calling her the "best-looking attorney general in the country." The remarks, made during a fundraiser in California yesterday, sparked a swift backlash among political commentators. New York magazine's Jonathan Chait called the remark "disgraceful," and Los Angeles Times columnist Robin Abcarian characterized it as "more wolfish than sexist." Clearly, Obama's handlers recognized they had a problem on their hands, and Obama called Harris a few hours later to apologize, according to White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. You know, they are old friends and good friends and he did not want in any way to diminish the attorney generals professional accomplishments and her capabilities," Carney told reporters at the White House press briefing today, according to The New York Times.

It must be kind of fun for her to be at the receiving end of that kind of presidential gaffe.

He meant to say she is a credit to her race, which is how she got her job, I imagine.

It’s part of the plan; too many folks were catching on to Soetoro’s homosexuality, so his handlers engineered a false flag sexual harassment incident..

I’m not surprised that Obama finds Kamala Harris to be the best looking female politician. Harris looks like Obama — same coloring, similar features. If we’re going to be handing out politician superlatives, as we know, Obama is the most narcississtic. Basically, Obama is telling us that he finds himself wearing a wig hot.

Liberal 0dumnb0 apologizing to another liberal, California Attorney General Kamala Harris. Now that's something that would never happen if a liberal was apologizing for smearing & insulting a conservative. Then it's usually a qualified apology...."if you were offended, then I apologize". Most likely 0dumb0 was trying to hit up on her, and got called out by some of the liberal media. The rest of the liberal media was defending 0dumb0's remarks. The thing that I look forward to, is for "single parent" moochelle to open up a giant can of whoopass on her effeminate hubby 0dumb0 when he returns. I bet $100 he is sleeping for the next couple of nights in the Oval office just to get away from phat ass moooochelle.

Air brushing photos can work wonders with improvements! I doubt she can hold a candle to several dozen republican ladies, like Sarah Palin, Wisconsin Lt Gov Rebecca Kleefish, etc.

Yeah, they had to engineer this to cancel out Moochie’s “single mom” remark to draw attention away from it. [I’d call myself a “single mom” too if I had to use a turkey baster.

...Harris is the first female, African-American, and Asian American attorney general in California, as well as the first ethnic Asian Indian American attorney general in the United States.

So,,, now he’s saying she’s NOT good looking?? So Obama is saying she’s ugly, and probably thinks her ass is fat too!
If he was a heterosexual, he’d know you can’t escape by just apologizing to a woman and then everything is OK. But he wouldn’t know that.

She’s a very attractive woman. Hopefully, she is not a moon-bat liberal, but I am pretty sure that she is considering that she represents California.

There are no accidents, or darned few. One suspects that Mister Obama planned, rehearsed, and performed the statement; and, then the "news"-making apology. There are no accidents, (or darned few.).

yeah trouble in paradise, first with the single mother slip, and then with Obama's inappropriate remarks. The Obamas are becoming more Clinton like. How long before Obama has a blue dress situation? Instead of an intern, who would she he be?

Why is it wrong to notice her beauty? Jealosy, simple jealosy. Liberals are losers and cannot stand their betters. That’s why organizing, joining and controlling are their favorite pastimes. They cannot win by merit and the fact is she’s pretty and prettier than our IL AG who is also incompetent, so pretty would be a plus.
