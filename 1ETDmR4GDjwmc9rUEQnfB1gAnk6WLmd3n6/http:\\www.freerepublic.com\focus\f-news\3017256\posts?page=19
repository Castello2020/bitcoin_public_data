Antibiotics could cure 40pc of chronic back pain patients
Telegraph ^
Posted on 05/08/2013 5:59:24 PM PDT by djf
The radical findings follow years of debate about the cause of such discomfort and the best way to treat it. One leading neurosurgeon said the finding was a turning point so important that the researchers behind it deserved a Nobel prize. But infection experts cautioned against widespread long-term prescribing of antibiotics, which could increase drug resistance across the population, triggering a rise in superbugs. Around five million people in Britain will suffer chronic back pain at some point in their lives, and the cause is often not clear.

I was just thinking the other day about ulcers (no real reason). They used to be a big deal, right? No real cure? Then somebody figured out that antibiotics could fix ‘em.

My lower back problem is due to two degenerated discs at L4-5 - no antibiotic is going to put cushion back in there, darn it.

A lot of times lower back pain is actually kidney pain. Keep a record of what you eat and see if there is a correlation of your back pain with particular foods. I find ice cream will do it.

I think alot of chronic lower back pain is the result of diet.It was for me, I had it for years, made some adjustments and the problem went away.

So sorry.
But the article says 40pc, so that’s a better than one out of three chance that if you have chronic, debilitating back pain, this can help. Maybe even cure it!
A good friend of mine has this type of problem, he doesn’t remember ever doing anything that injured it in the first place. Most of the time he’s OK, but a couple times a month he’s pretty out of it.
Back pains are one of the worst. There’s literally almost no way you can move at all that doesn’t stress the back at least a little.

“So sorry” My chair is a recliner and I keep it pushed back some so pressure is not on the lower back. I cannot sit on a hard surface very long or the pain is very bad and I can't walk the next day. It's like bone on bone and a pill isn't going to keep that from happening. They have to be talking about a condition that is not degenerated discs.

Correct. The inflammation caused by the bacteria and the toxins can inhibit or prevent the natural healing process from doing it’s job.

I know a woman whose back started hurting in October 2011. She was in excrutiating pain and ended up in a wheelchair. She was hospitalised once and they gave her antibiotics and she actually got better but as soon as she was off of them she got worse again. She told the doctor and he said that he couldn’t in good conscience give her more because the tests showed no infection.
I couldn’t believe it! She went through a year of pain until they finally found that she had a staph infection in her spine, it had eaten away part of it and she is still rehabbing.
I would have gone to Mexico and gotten the antibiotics myself.

My back is a train wreck, no antibiotic is going to make any difference.
Stretching, music, humor, and prayer all get remarkable results, though.
Second string remedies: back rubs and an occasional 500mg magnesium salicylate (formerly Doan’s Pills).

Well, if your back pain is caused by being bed-ridden because of some infection, then the antibiotic could resolve the infection, and clear up the back problem. Otherwise, it sounds like a big load of Bravo Sierra. They always seems to find a reason for us to take another pill.
My back has gotten better ever since I started taking steps to make it and the supporting muscles stronger and more limber. This requires all of 10-15 minutes of stretching before I go to bed. The Horror! If history is any guide, I will gradually fall out of the habit of stretching, push myself too hard running, and hurt my back again. They don’t have a pill to fix that.

The doc is a quack!
A serious infection should show up in a low white count, and also in a severe temperature anomaly at the area of the infection.

Okay, everybody, since my body is being talked about: Two degenerated disks - there's no cushion between L4 and L5. Best back specialists in Houston, Texas. X-rays, MRI, no cushion left - it's bone on bone. As I told djf, they said the best treatment is “don't gain weight”, “stay like you are”. I am not a heavy person but if I was, every extra pound means more trouble for a spine. I have a special cushion with a cut out where the spine sits. If I'm going to be somewhere away from my house for a few hours, I take this cushion, it has a handle, plus I have another cushion just like that one that I sit on when I drive. I have to keep pressure off my spine. If this discovery says there is bacteria in that area that won't let cushion regrow (which it doesn't anyway, it's there at birth and if you take it out, it's not coming back), and they have proved that, I'll take the antibiotic unless it kills the rest of my body. My right knee has little to no cartilage left in it, either. I had surgery on that knee about six or seven years ago - arthritic crap was in there and he removed that. That stuff was floating around in there causing pain - I was using a cane. After the surgery, I don't use a cane and no one would know there is anything wrong with the knee. However, if I walk a long distance, it doesn't want to walk anymore and pain is back. For that reason, I have a handicap hanger in my car so I don't have to walk long distances to buildings. Is bacteria keeping cartilage from regrowing in my knee? No, it doesn't regrow - once it's gone, it's gone. When I traveled around Texas a number of years ago, giving 4 hr. training sessions in Texas Election Law to Republicans, I always had a cushioned stool. I would stand and instruct and I would sit on that stool, switching back and forth so I didn't stand too long to make the back hurt, and I didn't have to sit the whole time. No one ever knew why I had that stool. In fact, the good friend lady who drove me around Texas didn't know why I had that stool until several months ago. I had never told her. Now, if antibiotics can cure what's wrong, bring them on unless they are going to kill me. Now, you know about my bones. The rest of me is fine. :o)

My lower back problem is due to two degenerated discs at L4-5You and me both. Degenerative discs, arthritis and some bone spurring. Don't even get me started on my knees.

Yes I had some bad discs (confirmed by MRI) but was able (via a rather brutal exercise program) to build up enough core strength to lower my pain level 95%.
It took several months, and it wasn’t fun, but I’m forever indebted to the phys therapists on this one.

Depends on why it’s gone.
Condroitin Sulphate promotes regrowth for about 2/3 of people.

If you have bone spurring going on, all of your light metals are out of balance. That is something to be concerned about because it also causes cataracts.
Get your calcium and magnesium up to par and it will stop.

95% is pretty amazing!
When I do what they told me to do, I’m fine for months or even years at a time. I have to keep the hamstrings flexible, and the lower back muscles in shape. It isn’t fun, but the stretching before bedtime actually seems to improve my sleep.

“Condroitin Sulphate promotes regrowth for about 2/3 of people.” That's more of an oil to promote easier moving of bones at joints. Look what's in that - I would be dead - shell fish oil. Shell fish puts me in the hospital. See, I thought that might help my bone on bone situation move easier - then, I'm standing in the drug store and reading the ingredients and put the bottle back on the shelf - I didn't dare take that. That was a big disappointment. I have a permanent scar on my arm where the hospital did an iodine test. Man, did I fail that test. Before that was over, my skin rotted out where they put the iodine under the skin. That wound had to heal from the inside out and it is a white spot as it took all the pigment out of that spot. No hospital can give me iodine in anything - it's on every medical chart I have. Shrimp, crab, clam, now that is poison to me. I still wish I could take that Condroitin Sulphate.

Condroitin sulfate is the primary ingredient in cartilage.
The best source of it is eating the cartilage from chicken joints. Don’t over-cook though.

While I agree that long term use of antibiotics to reduce inflammation is quackery, inflammation is a real cause of chronic illness. Antibiotics can be a short-term crutch. Dentists clearly believe antibiotics are good for the heart, since anyone with a heart history usually has to pre-medicate with antibiotics before any cleaning.
I see myself as an example of using inflammation control to improve my health.
Ten years ago, I was a physical wreck. I weighted 220lbs, couldn’t walk a couple blocks without heart pain, joint pain and exhaustion. I changed my diet to what turned out to be a low-inflammatory diet (gluten-free, carb-controlled), lost 50 lbs, changed my exercise routine and made a commitment to continue this.
Now, I can run regularly without pain. I feel younger and healthier.
Honestly, I am in better shape than I was in high school. Granted, I was a fat tub of goo in high school.

You are wrong unless you can give me that info. from a scientist. You won’t find any chicken in these pills. Here’s what in those pills with the warning for shellfish.
four times daily, preferably with meals.
This product contains shellfish (crab, shrimp. Lobster, crayfish) ingredients.
Other Ingredients: Gelatin, Rice Powder.
WARNING: Do not consume product if you have an allergy to shellfish. Not intended for use by pregnant or nursing women. If you are taking any medications, consult your doctor before use.

No question that inflammation is a big evil doer, and spirochete bacteria in the mouth are a major issue in heart attacks, and in various forms of dementia.
Sodium bicarbonate is great at controlling oral bacteria.
Antibiotics are a disaster to your health. They destroy your gut for years, and restoration is difficult.

Its the pills that are wrong.
Consuming the substance that you lack works. You obviously don’t lack the crap from the shellfish. My son-in-law severely injured his knee, and nothing his orthopedist gave him helped at all, but he healed in two weeks when I gave him a bottle of shark cartilage.
As the saying goes, you are what you eat.

My back is a train-wreck, and I have terrible pain in my right-knee and right-heel.
Doing inversion therapy helps with my back as it takes the pressure off of the back, but for only so long.
I do have to take some strong pain meds a few times a month. Otherwise, I can’t move and can barely do so with pain meds.
And the back spasms that go along with it aren’t much fun either.

Back pain can be due to a variety of sources; osteoarthritis, disc, muscular conditions are the most common. But this might help those with with disco-genic back pain (disc herniations, degeneration, annular tears etc). Instead of exposing patents to the systemic effects of oral/IV antibiotics, an intra-discal administration would probably be more effective with fewer adverse effects (such as C. diff). As with ulcers (H. Pylori), the most common pathogens for discs need to be identified.

I have that same cushion from Relax The Back store with the cut out sections so your tailbone is not compressed. Also it is a wedge shape which is just the perfect angle for my hip joints to be comfortable. I actually have 2 cushions one for my car and one for my chair at the dinner table. Best things I ever bought.

I had one for my car and one for my chair. We also had two for my husband. He is gone now, so I have two more, use one at dining table and one on my desk chair. I can’t do without them.

I had the same problem with L4-5 and found a wonderful doctor here in Springfield, Mo. He did a minimally invasive procedure and put cadaver bone and my bone marrow in the discs. He then put a metal frame around them to hold that and it will fuse together.
Because of the location of the discs I don’t have restricted movement. I have a scar an inch and a half long, was in surgery a little over an hour. Spent two days in the hospital and in two weeks I was walking a mile a day. I am not young either...76. Best thing I ever did!! No pain and it is wonderful after suffering for years.
