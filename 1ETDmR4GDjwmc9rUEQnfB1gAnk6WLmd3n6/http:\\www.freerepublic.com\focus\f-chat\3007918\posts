A kidney grown in the laboratory has been transplanted into animals where it started to produce urine, US scientists say. Similar techniques to make simple body parts have already been used in patients, but the kidney is one of the most complicated organs made so far. A study, in the journal Nature Medicine, showed the engineered kidneys were less effective than natural ones. But regenerative medicine researchers said the field had huge promise.

In the near future they will use nano-tech 3D bio printers to create new organs.
What do you need today? A new liver? A new face? A new heart?
Just give us a tissue sample and in a week or two it will be ready.

But only for the elite. See “Brave New World” for future medical advances and the direction we are really headed. .

Maybe it will one day be like how the character, Leeloo, was created in the movie, “The Fifth Element.”

Then how would a normal market respond to serve the non-elite? There would be money to be made from the sampling, generation, marketing, and sale of these kind of organs.
Printed organs, in a usable quality, remove the objections related to organ harvesting(which would become uneconomic versus creating organs) while providing a very close (if not better) substitute.
That, and marketing one’s own organs might become more than a one-off opportunity.

All advances, medical or otherwise, go to the ‘elite’ first.
Rich people got Plasma TVs and personal computers before everyone else too. Early adopters pay through the nose and lower the price for the rest of us.

Yeo. The price of my TV is now at less than 30% of what it was.
On the other hand, the price of a bottle of Cola Zero is almost double over the period of a year.
The markets are very weird here. Big business and big socialism hand in hand.

Read up more on population control, death panels and Agenda 21. There will be no ‘for the rest of us’. We are to some, a “cancer on the face of the earth”. And will be removed accordingly through health issues (obamacare) or otherwise.

And, don’t forget, serve as guinea pigs for the rest of us. New means untested and untested means dangerous. But hey, someone’s got to be the pioneer...
I’m more than willing to let a few rich people try out the new 3-D printed livers and lungs before they get cheap and reliable enough for the general population.

This is huge news if they can make long-term dialysis a thing of the past.

Aren’t the elite the only ones that would be able to afford this? Unless we want govt to control medicine...

I don’t think it’s a matter of the rich being the only ones to afford it. like anything ‘mass production’ the cost would quickly drop if it went into wide use. The thing is that Obamacare and the libs are already restricting cancer and other drugs. They suddenly are in short supply everywhere.
At my pharmacy I see regular notices that this or that drug is no longer available. Does anyone honestly believe something like lab organs, something that could save tens if not hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, will be allowed into wide use when that so thoroughly interferes with population reduction efforts?
IMO it will be tied up for years if not decades with testing and ‘approval’ by govt agencies. ANYTHING to further the cause/ Tinfoil? Maybe. But their death panel/abortion BS doesn’t instill any confidence in me that any BUT the pols and other rich/powerful will have access. And the drug situation pretty much cements that belief for me.

Medical costs for something of this nature, do not quickly drop off. My wife’s chemo is still around $10k per visit, and cancer therapies have been around a long time.

Forgetting the tendency of the gov’t tentacle to keep the Free market out of kilter; along with having foisted the ‘basic cable’ style health-care package(s) (why do I, as a man, need baby care in my policy??) by 3rd party instead of those are would use them?
I remember, growing up, sitting at the docs office (where he smoked), and parents paying very little ‘out of pocket’ to keep me healthy....Why not anymore? GOVERNMENT.
