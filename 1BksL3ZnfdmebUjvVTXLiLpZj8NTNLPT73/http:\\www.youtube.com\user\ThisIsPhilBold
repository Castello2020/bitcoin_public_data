ThisIsPhilBold replied to a comment from osciedub
I figured out it has to do with the LFO's sync function. If you take the sync off the harmonics disappear but I have no idea how to fix the glitch with the sync activated, and it's pretty hard to sync appropriately by ear. If anyone knows how to fix this PLEASE let me know!
