Leniency of IRS and other tax collection agencies in giving tax relief, fewer penalties 6. Tax evader lotteries - be rewarded when you are audited Imagine a world with no government, where laws are enforced by private security and arbitration. Those who cannot work receive charity and insurance money. The misery index collapses, lower unemployment, inflation, and interest rates, the standard of living is through the roof. Read "The Anarchists' Manifesto" by James Dante Wood on Amazon, an account of how 7 years of Hell on Earth (anarchy with chaos) leads to 1,000 years of peace (anarchy with peace) and proof of the talent of John of the Gospels and Nostradamus. Peace can only be acheived through freedom, security, and prosperity, and the existence of government is a threat to all those things.

He had been completely broke and in search of a way to gain financial freedom when he discovered North American Power. What started as a ?Side Project? began to grow, as did his income. In November of 2013, Kevin earned over $1,000,000 in combined earnings making him one of the very first Representatives to ever achieve this incredible milestone. Now that Kevin is earning a residual income every month, he has more free time and money to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. Since pursuing the Opportunity, Kevin has been able to take his life back, make a difference in the lives of others, and earn an income so impressive that it inspired Diana (his new Bride) to leave a corporate job she hated, and join him so they can succeed together. ?The best thing is, we have the financial freedom to work the hours we want and make as much income as we choose, and we spend as much time as we want with friends, family, and each other.? ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Just a few short years ago, the real estate meltdown and a very costly divorce left Kevin Marino working tirelessly to earn ends meet in hopes of one day gaining financial security.

They often feel that everything and everybody is against them and the stress of just being alive is almost more than they can endure. What about you? Do you have stress that is preventing you from being happy? These feelings often come from efforts to control our environments, conflicts with other people, and an inability to get by. Tensions take many forms and involve such emotions as anger, hate, anxiety, guilt and fear. These bring about physically and emotionally damaging effects which can result in illness. Of course, we all need some stress to stay alive, awake, and alert. We must learn what our best level of stress is and how to use it to function effectively. We don't want to allow extreme reactions to envelop us so that day-to-day living gets the better of us. We need to not let the external stress control our lives, but instead control our internal responses so that we can use the power of the Life within us to create our best lives possible. Join Choices host and author of ?You Are More Than Enough,? Judi Moreo, for a discussion on simple and easy ways you can reduce the bad stressors in your life. Whether you are an executive, a stay-at-home mom, or even an astronaut, these techniques are so easy, you can incorporate them into your daily life and you'll wonder why you didn't think of them yourself and why you haven't been doing them all along. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Many people feel life is a struggle and they are on the losing side.

In short, America was founded on the principle of Liberty- the freedom to think or act without being constrained by necessity, nor force. In other words, it's living by the Golden Rule- Do unto others as you would have done to you. Matthew 7:12 "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law of the prophets" - King James Version. Mark 12:31 "And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these."- King James Version. The most important freedom we have, according to our nation's founding, is the freedom of religion. That is why it is the first freedom that is protected in the Bill of Rights. It is true, that this First Amendment also forbids the government from respecting the establishment of religion. This, of course, means that the federal government cannot enact law deeming one type of religion, or denomination thereof, as supreme. This goes further to protect individuals to worship as they choose. This 'separation of church and state', does not mean that God, Jesus, or any religion for that matter, by law, ought to be kept out of the public.The truth is quite to the contrary. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tonight we will dive in head first to the Truth about the founding of America, the idea of America, and the future of America.

She said a thousand dollars.... I opened a regular place of business... During this time I had found it politic to go shabbily dressed, and to appear to be very poor, but to pay my mistress for my services promptly. I kept my money hid, never venturing to put out a penny, nor to let any body but my wife know that I was making any. The thousand dollars was what I supposed my mistress would ask for me, and so I determined now what I would do.
