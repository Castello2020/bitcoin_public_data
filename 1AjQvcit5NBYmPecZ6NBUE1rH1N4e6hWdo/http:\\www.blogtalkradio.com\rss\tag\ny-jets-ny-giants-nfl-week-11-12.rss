It is a process. The process begins by changing your life because you realize you have been living the wrong way. Conversion consists of the following steps... Today we will continue with step 4 and on going... 4. Don't forsake fellowshipping with other believers. Fellowshipping with believers is part of the elimination of sin process (1 John 1:1-7; Hebrews 10:25). &bull;The gospel is first for Jews and equally for everyone else (Romans 1:16). The Gospel is for everyone. Yet, the TRUE & COMPLETE Gospel has Jewish characteristics and foundation. Messiah, when He identified Himself as the Messiah in one of the many Jewish synagogues of His day, stated the following: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, Because He has anointed Me To Preach the Gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, To set at liberty those who are oppressed; To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord." (Luke 4:18). The TRUE and COMPLETE Gospel is a message that involves Spirituality, Socioeconomics (making a living) and Prophecy. The message of the Jewish Gospel is salvation is offered to mankind through Yeshua Messiah (Jesus Christ) (Romans 1:1- 6; 1 Corinthians 15:1-4; John 10:27-38) and we must prove to YHWH (God) we believe Him through righteous works (Matthew 7:21-23; James 2:14-26; John 3:16-21). We must bear fruit (Matthew 3:10-12; Galatians 5:22-23).

Noone wants to suffer pain, but we have forgotten how much power we have over the experience of it. As stated in lesson 190 (I choose the joy of God instead of Pain), "Pain is a sign illusions reign in place of truth." How can we let those illusions go and welcome truth? By changing our thoughts-""It is your thoughts alone that cause you pain." As we change our thoughts, we change our world, both inner and outer. The very world we perceive is a "representation of our thoughts." These metaphysical principles are basic to the teachings of the Course. And we can truly benefit from them as far more than just pretty intellectual exercises as we share them and practice them.So call in tonight and experience the healing and peace that comes from actually sharing them --experience your Self--radiant in this holy joy...forever." ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[This week, we read from and discuss Lessons 189 and 190.
