I can't promise that we will win every battle in Washington, but I can promise that I will always put the people of this territory first as I have dedicated my entire life to effective and efficient public service. In my enthusiastic support for our beloved home, I will not lose sight of the challenges faced by all Americans and of the importance of becoming part of both Democratic and bipartisan alliances in the face of ongoing Congressional gridlock. As your Delegate, each day I will advocate for your unalienable rights and support a platform for Virgin Islands progress and prosperity &ndash; as our people deserve nothing less." - Shawn-Michael Malone Senate President Shawn-Michael Malone was elected to his 6th legislative term on Nov 6, 2012. Born Aug 29, 1968 & raised on St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands, Senator Malone is the 5th of 6 children born to the late Roy Milton Malone, a noted Virgin Islands musician, and Pauline Monell-Francis Williams. He attended several schools, including the Bertha C. Boschulte Jr High, & Ivanna Eudora Kean High School, before graduating Sts. Peter & Paul High in 1986. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts in Political Science degree from Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia in 1991. His recent achievements on behalf of the people of the Territory include the Virgin Islands Smoke Free Act. Because protecting public health & the environment has been important aspects in his legislative career, he has been instrumental in preserving island beaches, air quality, & waters, among other things. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA["I stand firmly behind my initiatives to diversify and grow our economy and improve opportunities for hardworking Virgin Islanders at a time when we must act swiftly to preserve and support our shrinking middle class.

I am a delegate along with many other Kingwood Area Democrats. Bobby Rodrigo was kind enough to step in for me this week. Anyone who knows Bobby Rodrigo knows he does not like any of our current major political parties. He made sure to give me a civil Coffee Party like ribbing about my full involvement with the Democratic Party. But that's is what Coffee Party USA is all about. It is about being able to work together, like each other even if we are at opposite ends of the spectrum or have any types of disagreements. Bobby Rodrigo embodies that. Here is the Bobby's show. Seeding Community Change Becoming an entrepreneur, starting a business, is one of the most enduring and powerful myths in out culture. Captains of Industry are lauded as dacoits of society and too often portrayed as better citizens than the rest of us. This is NOT what moved Kwabena Nkromo to launch Atlanta Food and Farm LLC or AF2 as it is affectionately referred to his team. Less inspired by the conventional Horatio Alger ideal Kwabena was determined to find a pathway to greater wealth and well being for his entire community in addition to himself and his family and friends. Kwabena does not consider himself a business person per say. When he established a Food Justice and Urban Farming Social Enterprise it was more about a personal transformation for him and the other people working with him rather than simply earning profits. Today I introduce Kwabena and the organization he founded to Coffee Party and discuss how he did it and why what he is doing in Atlanta is so very important. Join me Bobby Rodrigo as I guest host on Politics Done Right this Saturday. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[This week'??s show June 28th, 2014 This week I am at the Texas Democratic Convention.
