By taking a glimpse into the Garden of Eden, we can see God's original intention for men, women, and their partnership with one another.

Discovering this divine purpose is even more fascinating when you see how it is supported by brain science, relationship research, as well as the principles and fundamentals of psychology and sociology. Want to see what the Bible truly reveals about being a wife and a husband? Join us as we dive into a totally new way of understanding the relationship between the sexes with relationship expert Jennifer Miller. She will be sharing insights from her new book, "No Longer Two: A Guide to How God Created Men, Women, and Marriage." Before and after the show, please post your questions and comments for Jory and Jennifer on Jory's Facebook Business Page. Jennifer Miller is a Christian pastor, professional counselor, and author who has dedicated her career to helping individuals, couples, and families strengthen their faith and their relationships.Her new book, ?No Longer Two: A Guide to How God Created Men, Women, and Marriage,? is a compilation of all the wisdom she has gained and shared over the years on what truly makes relationships work, as well as how to communicate across the gender gap. It reveals new insights into how men and women think and behave, while also guiding you to understand what the Bible truly has to say about you and marriage. In addition to teaching and writing on marriage and family topics, she serves as the Co-Executive Director of The Center for Living Well, a nonprofit Christian wellness ministry, based in Phoenix, Arizona with divisions in both Canada and Michigan. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[What if a man and woman becoming one is not a commandment, but really how God created us to function best?

We will also be discussing current events regarding the police state and what steps you can take to educate yourself and others. Remember, badges do not grant extra rights! The show promotes and discusses the ideas of freedom and liberty for all people without the partisan politics. Exposing the government mafia that rules only by threat of force without concent. I support consentual volunitary relationships. I don't want someone else to represent me, when I know what's best for me and can represent myself. I am not a republican, I am not a democrat. I'm not a liberal, I'm not a conservative. I will not allow you to define me, or force me to join one of your gangs.
