The Divine Mother (the Holy Spirit, Shakti, the Phenomenal) and the Holy Father (Brahman, the Transcendental) are One. The Mother is the Voice in the silence of the Father, the One crying in the wilderness as the universal creative vibration known as Aum/Amen. So this show will be a surprise. Steve will be responding to her lead rather than leading her (as if anyone ever could!). So listen in as the Mother discusses the impact of the Tsunami of Love and what the next wave will bring. Linda Dillon channels Archangel Michael and other guests from the Council of Love to provide spiritual teachings and guidance on co-creating the New Earth. Interviewed by Steve Beckow, editor of the Golden Age of Gaia. Produced by Graham Dewyea.

This week on Talk-N-Angels Radio Show, we invite Dr. Stephen Oliver to join us to talk about emotional intelligence, for it is gaining popularity in the business world as a measure of intelligence that can be considered equally important and sometimes more important than IQ. But what is really intriguing is the idea that the use of "gut instinct" is brought into this conversation, and as we always talk about on this show, listening to your gut is using your intuition. Has intuition found its way into mainstream academia? How do you know your level of emotional intelligence? We'll find out this and more on Wednesday, 7/9/14 at 7 pm right here on Talk-N-Angels Radio Show. Dr. Stephen Oliver is one of this area's most respected Human Resources, organizational development and training professionals. An academic with a broad range of consulting, training and teaching experience, he engages with students and leaders in Corporate America and has earned high praise as an active facilitator, motivating coach and dedicated mentor. Through his management consultancy HRCVision, Stephen works with organizations as a Leadership and training consultant focusing in the areas of critical thinking, strategic planning, leadership development, emotional intelligence, and diversity in the workplace.
