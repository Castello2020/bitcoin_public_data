James is the owner of:www.kingzkrib.com, a daily Sports Information and Fantasy Sports site. James also produces "Tailgating at Tha KRIB", our sister show, that covers the NFL/FantasyFootball season. Join us on Wednesday nights, from 5:00 - 7:00 PM(PST), Wally, from @UrbanSportsScene cover the DMV Sports scene, and bring us a "fresh" prespective, to the workings and insght of sports, around the Nation's capital.

Detroit was once a great and vibrant City. Because of years of mismangement and neglect, it is now a shell of what it once was. There will be a Mass Rally on Friday, July 18th, 2014 at1 Hart Plaza, Detroit, MI 48226 by Progressive Democrats of America to fight incumbent GOP Governor Rick Snyder's approach on how he is mishandling Michigan. Why is it that when businesses owe thousands of dollars for water, they don't get cut off? When the "Average Joe" and "Average Jane" owes a little in comparison their water is cut off? It's inhumane and plain cruel! Rick Snyder and his heartless cadre of elected Republicans in Michigan have proven how out of touch they really are. They are controlled by the wealthy Koch Brothers and DeVoes Family. Michigan Media have been M.I.A. as nobody cares for the citizens of Detroit. Where do we go from here and what can you do to make your voices heard and make a difference? If you think it won't happen to you in your City? Think again! They're trying to privatize everything including water. It's time to fight back America! Monica Patrick from the Detroit Water Coalition is our special guest tonight. We'll discuss what's being done to combat this grave injustice and how you can help. Join us!

They say they haven't had an increase in 7 years, however their salaries have increased $47 million?! Confused? Me too. Hopefully Kyle can explain it. Have you had your healthy dose of reality lately? There are always at least two sides to every story. Have you ever wondered how someone, who saw the same thing you did, walked away telling a vastly different story? Which version was correct? Which one was the REAL story? Actually, both are! It's just a matter of perspective. Joe takes the issues&hellip; especially the controversial issues (politics, prejudice, religion, illegal immigration)&hellip; and brings in people from different sides to share their viewpoint. This is definitely not a fluff piece. And while no one is attacked, the questions are hard-hitting. But the conversation is always respectful and you're sure to learn something new, even if you don't agree! If you've always wondered how the ?other side? thinks and how they've arrived at their ?stand?, then this is the show for you!
