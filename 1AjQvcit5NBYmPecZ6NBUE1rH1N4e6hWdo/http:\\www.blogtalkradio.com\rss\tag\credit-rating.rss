But even with the recent "reports," it would still be a surprise to me if that's the business decision LBJ decides to make this offseason. Plus, what are the other stars like Carmelo Anthony and Chris Bosh going to do, and what does it mean for the NBA? There are reports that Andre Johnson wants to be traded from the Houston Texans and at least four teams have made inquiries in that regard. We love Dre here in Houston, but he Texans absolutely have to entertain these discussions. Throw pride, ego and sentiment out the window. In non-sports related topics, the marijuana stores in Washington are having a supply and demand issue.
