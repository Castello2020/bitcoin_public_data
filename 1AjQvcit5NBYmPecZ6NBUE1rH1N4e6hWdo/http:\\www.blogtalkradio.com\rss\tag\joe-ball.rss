It's known as LA's premier oceanfront resort and the second you enter the property, you see exactly why it got this designation. This week Peter Greenberg will broadcast from Terranea, which is celebrating its 5th anniversary. Located on the exact site that used to be home to Marineland, a theme park Peter himself remembers visiting fondly as a young boy, Terranea not only offers new and exciting things to do, but has an amazing history. Peter is joined by Allan Franz, an anthropologist and professor working with the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy who tells Peter all about the local history, including what famous show was shot right off the Peninsula in front of the hotel. Hint: One of the restaurants at Terranea is named after it. He also gets a chance to meet some of the wild falcons that live at the center. Peter talks to Joe Roy who tells him all about the history of falcons in the area and why they stay. You can listen to all of this and more on this week's epsiode of Travel Today with Peter Greenberg from Terranea Resort in Ranchos Palos Verdes. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Terranea Resort is located on the beautiful Palos Verdes Pennisula just south of Los Angeles.

Author David Christopher joins Joe to discuss his book telling a new creation story that integrates the science of the 20th and 21st centuries with a spiritual sensibility toward the creation of the Universe. Have you had your healthy dose of reality lately? There are always at least two sides to every story. Have you ever wondered how someone, who saw the same thing you did, walked away telling a vastly different story? Which version was correct? Which one was the REAL story? Actually, both are! It's just a matter of perspective. Joe takes the issues&hellip; especially the controversial issues (politics, prejudice, religion, illegal immigration)&hellip; and brings in people from different sides to share their viewpoint. This is definitely not a fluff piece. And while no one is attacked, the questions are hard-hitting. But the conversation is always respectful and you're sure to learn something new, even if you don't agree! If you've always wondered how the ?other side? thinks and how they've arrived at their ?stand?, then this is the show for you!

Have you ever wondered how someone, who saw the same thing you did, walked away telling a vastly different story? Which version was correct? Which one was the REAL story? Actually, both are! It's just a matter of perspective. Joe takes the issues&hellip; especially the controversial issues (politics, prejudice, religion, illegal immigration)&hellip; and brings in people from different sides to share their viewpoint. This is definitely not a fluff piece. And while no one is attacked, the questions are hard-hitting. But the conversation is always respectful and you're sure to learn something new, even if you don't agree! If you've always wondered how the ?other side? thinks and how they've arrived at their ?stand?, then this is the show for you! It's not the right side, it's not the wrong side, but the REAL side of the issues! ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Kyle Olson with EAGnews joins Joe to discuss the Los Angeles teachers' union demanding a 17% salary increase.

They say they haven't had an increase in 7 years, however their salaries have increased $47 million?! Confused? Me too. Hopefully Kyle can explain it. Have you had your healthy dose of reality lately? There are always at least two sides to every story. Have you ever wondered how someone, who saw the same thing you did, walked away telling a vastly different story? Which version was correct? Which one was the REAL story? Actually, both are!
