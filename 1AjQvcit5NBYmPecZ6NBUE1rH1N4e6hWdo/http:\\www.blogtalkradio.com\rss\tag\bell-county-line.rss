It has been a central theme in my parenting and teaching for over four decades! Over the next few weeks, I'll be sharing with you, various practices which are supportive to "Raising Peaceful Children". If you are important in the life of a child, I invite you to tune in. If inspired, call in and share an insight or a precious moment you shared with a child. PRACTICE 11: Your Core Family Values! Part 2: We'll continue the conversation about core values tonight. In addition, we'll talk about having "secondary" values, those which are important to you but not at the forefront. Knowing your Family Values and living those values, truly creates a home that reflects who you are and what is important to you! Values create a foundation for your home! Sharon Ann Wikoff is a teacher, consultant, writer, and motivational speaker specializing in the fields of parenting, communicating with young children, self-esteem and personal transformation. She holds two teaching credentials and has been working with children and families for over 30 years. Her monthly column, "Listening 2 Children" appeared in the West County Gazette for several years. She is the author of two eBooks: The ART of Communicating with Infants and Young Children and The ART of Listening to Children: The 10 Minute Miracle. She also writes a blog, Raising Peaceful Children. Sharon is passionate about bringing great attention to the state of PEACE so we can truly learn to appreciate, honor and respect this state of being! ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA["Raising Peaceful Children" is a topic I'm very passionate.

Don West, along with Mark O'Mara, were George Zimmerman's attorneys at trial. Don West joins us today. Mr. West is a dedicated trial attorney whose career has largely been spent providing services to the indigent community. He is the former Senior Litigation Counsel for the Federal Defender's Office and supervisor of its Capital Defense Team. A criminal trial specialist, he has represented those accused of all nature of offenses. He is a former president of the Central Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, a former director of the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and a fellow member of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the National Trial Lawyers Top 100. We will also discuss updates in the case of Daniel Chong (who was incarcerated and forgotten about by DEA agents, and left for over 4 days without food or water), the Milwaukee Stabbing case, and other criminal matters. ---------- JASON K. FELDMAN spent the first five years of his career as a criminal prosecutor in Portland, Oregon where he tried over 40 cases to a jury, argued in hundreds of judicial hearings, and assisted in a capital murder prosecution. Mr. Feldman served in the District Attorney's Felony Drug and Vice Division where he mastered search and seizure law, conducted nearly 1,000 grand jury proceedings and orchestrated sting operations as well as the execution of search warrants. Mr. Feldman has steadily developed a reputation for aggressive, thorough representation of criminal defendants throughout Los Angeles County obtaining spectacular results at all phases of pre-trial as well as at trial. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[July 13 marks the one-year anniversary of the verdict in the highly-publicized trial of George Zimmerman, who was charged with the murder of Trayvon Martin.
