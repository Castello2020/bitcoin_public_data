I am an individual and I believe in freedom and liberty for all people, regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation as all human beings have a right to freedom and liberty. I will stand up to government oppression and do what I can to educate the public on the illusion and or lack of true freedom in America.

In short, America was founded on the principle of Liberty- the freedom to think or act without being constrained by necessity, nor force. In other words, it's living by the Golden Rule- Do unto others as you would have done to you. Matthew 7:12 "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law of the prophets" - King James Version. Mark 12:31 "And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these."- King James Version. The most important freedom we have, according to our nation's founding, is the freedom of religion. That is why it is the first freedom that is protected in the Bill of Rights. It is true, that this First Amendment also forbids the government from respecting the establishment of religion. This, of course, means that the federal government cannot enact law deeming one type of religion, or denomination thereof, as supreme. This goes further to protect individuals to worship as they choose. This 'separation of church and state', does not mean that God, Jesus, or any religion for that matter, by law, ought to be kept out of the public.The truth is quite to the contrary. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tonight we will dive in head first to the Truth about the founding of America, the idea of America, and the future of America.

Joe Herron is the 'ying', in the contrasting duo. Joe is an avid Cinninatti Reds and Dallas Cowboy fan, who brings his passionate, journalistic, but mild-mannered approach, to the program. James is the owner of:www.kingzkrib.com, a daily Sports Information and Fantasy Sports site. James also produces "Tailgating at Tha KRIB", our sister show, that covers the NFL/FantasyFootball season. Join us on Wednesday nights, from 5:00 - 7:00 PM(PST), Wally, from @UrbanSportsScene cover the DMV Sports scene, and bring us a "fresh" prespective, to the workings and insght of sports, around the Nation's capital. Justin Davis Jr(@jersymikejr ), one of our "original gang' joins us, when his time permits, and he continues to pursue his education, and support his Carolina Panthers, and Charlotte Bobcats.

America's border states are facing a humanitarian and national security crisis from Texas to California. As thousands of unaccompanied minors and adults are entering the country illegally, border states, especially Texas, are having their resources stretched thin while the federal government does next to nothing to stem the tide. While border states are being overwhelmed, the federal government is shipping the UAC and illegal entrants throughout the country. Dr. Dave McIntyre of "Thinking Enemy" and National Security expert, recently posted "Ten Facts About the Border Crisis", he will be our first guest 7:00 PM, In Murrieta, CA one mayor is fighting back! Mayor Pro-Tem Harry Ramos, has been speaking out and trying to spread the word that his town has had enough. They have protested, and plan to continue to protest each time a new bus load shows up. The federal government now has sent riot police and federal agents in, not to protect the town, but to protect the illegals. When we spoke with Mayor Ramos he explained that "Murrieta is an island of Texas in a sea of California!", that they are a small conservative town that is being inundated. Click here to learn more. We will round out the show with Mr. Chuck Wilson, former CIA and Immigration SME, and Adryana Boyne of Voces Action, they will be discussing what can and should be done to stem the tide at the border. We will have the live chat open for civil debate during the show. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Special Edition of the Waco Tea Party Watchdog Radio Show!

What is happening along the borders of America and what we might face down the road from unchecked illegal immigration. Mexico just signed a special agreement with several of the Central American countries giving them a special pass if they are heading towards America, fast tracking them to our borders. The Obama administration helped create this by telling the folks in other countries that theey woud not turn away minors, and making it as easy as ossible for them to cross illegally, and now saying it is the fault of republicans because they will not do what Obama tells them to, so he will create special executive orders to "fix" the situation. With illegal drug smuggling and the violence that goes with it, the already over burdened border patrol and immigration services, we now have the current massive wave of minor and unaccompanied children which is paralyzing the border. We are in danger of not just a huge burden on our medical, economic, justice systems, but the immigrants are racing for the borders to take advantage of what they feel will be the next big amnesty wave. These new illegal immigrants are now bringing with them diseases that have not been seen here in America for many years. Many of the so called "minors" are kids 18 years old who have been part of dangerous criminal gangs for years, including murderers, rapists and current illegal gang members. What are we going to do to solve our illegal immigration problems in America? We will also give you an update on the BattleRoadUSA training schedule for the rest of the year. Call in number is 347-308-8790 Hope to see you there! -Scout ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tonight we will discuss the current immigration problems facing America.
