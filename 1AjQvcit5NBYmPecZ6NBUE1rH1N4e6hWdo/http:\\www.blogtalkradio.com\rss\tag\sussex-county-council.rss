It has been a central theme in my parenting and teaching for over four decades! Over the next few weeks, I'll be sharing with you, various practices which are supportive to "Raising Peaceful Children". If you are important in the life of a child, I invite you to tune in. If inspired, call in and share an insight or a precious moment you shared with a child. PRACTICE 12: The Choice You Make DAILY! Once you know your values, you have a daily opportunity to reinforce them within your family. Being "aware" in each and every moment is a requirement if you truly want to have your home reflect the values most important to you. Knowing your values makes it easier to respond when issues such as gaming, cell phones and television arise. In addition, setting up "YES" Environments creates Peaceful Children & Peaceful Parents. I'll share some stories that illustrate these points. Sharon Ann Wikoff is a teacher, consultant, writer, and motivational speaker specializing in the fields of parenting, communicating with young children, self-esteem and personal transformation. She holds two teaching credentials and has been working with children and families for over 30 years. Her monthly column, "Listening 2 Children" appeared in the West County Gazette for several years. She is the author of two eBooks: The ART of Communicating with Infants and Young Children and The ART of Listening to Children: The 10 Minute Miracle. She also writes a blog, Raising Peaceful Children. Sharon is passionate about bringing great attention to the state of PEACE so we can truly learn to appreciate, honor and respect this state of being! ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA["Raising Peaceful Children" is a topic I'm very passionate.

Don West, along with Mark O'Mara, were George Zimmerman's attorneys at trial. Don West joins us today. Mr. West is a dedicated trial attorney whose career has largely been spent providing services to the indigent community. He is the former Senior Litigation Counsel for the Federal Defender's Office and supervisor of its Capital Defense Team. A criminal trial specialist, he has represented those accused of all nature of offenses. He is a former president of the Central Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, a former director of the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and a fellow member of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the National Trial Lawyers Top 100. We will also discuss updates in the case of Daniel Chong (who was incarcerated and forgotten about by DEA agents, and left for over 4 days without food or water), the Milwaukee Stabbing case, and other criminal matters. ---------- JASON K. FELDMAN spent the first five years of his career as a criminal prosecutor in Portland, Oregon where he tried over 40 cases to a jury, argued in hundreds of judicial hearings, and assisted in a capital murder prosecution. Mr. Feldman served in the District Attorney's Felony Drug and Vice Division where he mastered search and seizure law, conducted nearly 1,000 grand jury proceedings and orchestrated sting operations as well as the execution of search warrants. Mr. Feldman has steadily developed a reputation for aggressive, thorough representation of criminal defendants throughout Los Angeles County obtaining spectacular results at all phases of pre-trial as well as at trial. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[July 13 marks the one-year anniversary of the verdict in the highly-publicized trial of George Zimmerman, who was charged with the murder of Trayvon Martin.

How did I get here? I took the scenic route. I started making my own clothes when I was 9 and could probably fill a truck with ribbons won at County and State Fairs in California. Over the years this included learning about color, line, style, fabrics, fit, etc. During this time I also gained experience in marketing, training and many other skills I use every day. At age 12 I started working - as early as CA law would allow - and have worked my entire life since with the exception of a few years having and raising 3 children - 1 girl, 2 boys. It was less expensive to stay home, so I challenged myself by growing/processing food for the family, baking all of our bread and learning to knit and crochet. I ran a hobby/craft business later in life for about 4 years. My decision to open a plus size shop came about due to an illness and the resulting weight gain. I had no idea where to buy clothes, what size I needed or even who to ask. But, I was appalled with the treatment I received in most places. Plus size women are often relegated to the back room or the basement and smaller sized sales clerks can be very rude with no understanding of the problems plus size women struggle with. Athena's Closet, Inc. was designed and developed with all of these things in mind. Over the past 3 years it has become the premier plus size shopping experience in Denver with a bigger selection than most retail stores. In the entire Denver metro area there are only 2 independently owned plus size shops - Athena's Closet and Christine's Upscale Plus. Athena's Closet, Inc.
