During the World Cup Finals, a TV station in New York state interrupted the final six minutes of the game for a potentially life-saving tornado warning. The viewers, however, valued the game over their own lives and went off on that station. It begs the question: Would you care more about watching a TV show or sporting event or standing in line for a new gaming system over a potential weather disaster? There are plenty of scenarios that have played out like this, and we'll discuss the seriousness of this situation. Ikari Chaos-San is the founder and creator. Shirley is truly the Oddball Extreme. Janet is our resident Arizona Magician. Tim is the Tokusatsu Master. Plastic Kaiju is our resident Nestene Consciousness based Godzilla. Heather is Queen Kitty Serenity. MikeBoyens is our video game wizard. We'll also have appearances by our friends from the MAD HOUSE, so come and listen in! Visit our official website at http://beyondtheairwaves.weebly.com and don't forget to join in the conversation on the forums located on our official website. We want you guys and gals, the fans, to tell us what's on your mind and what you feel is important to cover, so let us know what you want to hear. **All sound effects are protected under fair use provisions and are NOT intended to create any copyright infringement.** ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is Beyond the Airwaves: The Infinity Project, where we go beyond the mainstream media and tackle issues that don't seem so important to the major networks.

Dane has a background in solar energy. He is a former employee of Bechtel Power Corp. and was a licensed contractor in California and Arizona. He has been engaged in constant climate/geoengineering research for over a decade. His personal residence was feature in a cover article on the world's largest renewable energy magazine, Home Power. He owns a 1,600-acre ?wildlife preserve? next to Lake Shasta in northern California. Dane put all his focus, efforts and energy on the geoengineering issue when he began to lose very significant amounts of solar uptake due to the ever-increasing ?solar obscuration? caused from jet aircraft spraying in the skies above his forest home. He also noted significant decline in forest health was occurring and appeared to be accelerating. Extensive testing and research into the geoengineering issue was commenced and has continued since 2002. He is the lead researcher for www.geoengineeringwatch.org and has investigated all levels of geo engineering from stratospheric aerosol geoengineering (SAG) to HAARP. He has appeared numerous films, and radio interviews to educate the public on the extremely dire environmental and health dangers we face on a global level from geoengineering.

Seth is a lifelong Knicks, Yankees, and Giants fan. We discuss the latest Sports subjects and personalities, each with our own unique styles. Wcsteeler is the old school (emphasis on "old"), "Diabolical Hater", in-your-face type, with 'no conscious', as he pounces on "targets of opportunity", and has no problem, expressing his sometimes 'dry humor', and sarcastic feelings, in no uncertain terms. Joe Herron is the 'ying', in the contrasting duo. Joe is an avid Cinninatti Reds and Dallas Cowboy fan, who brings his passionate, journalistic, but mild-mannered approach, to the program. James is the owner of:www.kingzkrib.com, a daily Sports Information and Fantasy Sports site. James also produces "Tailgating at Tha KRIB", our sister show, that covers the NFL/FantasyFootball season. Join us on Wednesday nights, from 5:00 - 7:00 PM(PST), Wally, from @UrbanSportsScene cover the DMV Sports scene, and bring us a "fresh" prespective, to the workings and insght of sports, around the Nation's capital. Justin Davis Jr(@jersymikejr ), one of our "original gang' joins us, when his time permits, and he continues to pursue his education, and support his Carolina Panthers, and Charlotte Bobcats. We have an interesting array of "Featured Guests" from all facets, of the Sports world, which we hope will add an interesting sense of 'spice', to a listeners, and potential callers. </itunes:summary><itunes:duration>02:02:00</itunes:duration><media:group><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/wcsteelerfan/2014/07/18/tha-sportskrib.mp3" fileSize="29276192" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/wcsteelerfan/2014/07/18/tha-sportskrib.wma" fileSize="29276192" type="audio/x-ms-wma" /></media:group><itunes:author>wcsteelerfan</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:keywords>SportsTalk,JoeHerron,DonHays,JackAndrade,JeffLloyd</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>Tha SPORTSKRIB</itunes:subtitle></item><item><title>the Daily Independent Immigration Watch</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/redpilldnetwork/2014/07/17/the-daily-independent-immigration-watch</link><description><![CDATA[the Daily Independent is hosted by American Daily Independent News Network (ADINN) journalist Keith Powell. the Daily Independent will feature top stories from the ADINN member sites and current events of interest to conservative Americans.Show will feature highlights stories in the ADINN Red Pill approved member outlets for the first segment and national nasty for the second segment.

California, New York, Oregon and Washington &ndash; what about Texas and Arizona &ndash; and yes, even Charles' home state of Minnesota produces wine. Which is why we asked Charles Curtis, Master of Wine and founder of AlphaWine to return to our Wet Your Whistle Series to walk us through what having 22 American wine producing states really means to our palettes. Are the big three even worth our white wine drinking time? Price, value, taste, growing and production &ndash; what's out there and what's ?out? there that we should aim to avoid. Best bets, trends and the perfect regional gift if you want to be generous and smart about your local wines. And of course, we will tell you where you should really go when you visit Napa.
