We are also two separate persons with our own individual values and needs. So that we will better know and understand what each of us values and needs, let us always be open and honest in our communication. When you are experiencing a problem in your life, I will try to listen with genuine acceptance and understanding in order to help you find your own solutions rather than imposing mine. And I want you to be a listener for me when I need to find solutions to my problems. At those times when your behavior interferes with what I must do to get my own needs met, I will tell you openly and honestly how your behavior affects me, trusting that you respect my needs and feelings enough to try to change the behavior that is unacceptable to me. Also, whenever some behavior of mine is unacceptable to you, I hope you will tell me openly and honestly so I can try to change my behavior. And when we experience conflicts in our relationship, let us agree to resolve each conflict without either of us resorting to the use of power to win at the expense of the other's losing. I respect your needs, but I also must respect my own. So let us always strive to search for a solution that will be acceptable to both of us. Your needs will be met, and so will mine&ndash;neither will lose, both will win. In this way, you can continue to develop as a person through satisfying your needs, and so can I. Thus, ours can be a healthy relationship in which both of us can strive to become what we are capable of being. And we can continue to relate to each other with mutual respect, love and peace.

During the preparation of the boxing camp a dear friend, (Shaunta Kenerly), reached out to Aubrey via Facebook due to the consistent thrust of positive quotes, comments, and poems. Shaunta Kenerly suggested that Aubrey use his force on a vaster plateau; by offering him a contract on ?Shaunta Kenerly/AMB Publishing?, six months after the conversation ?The Proverbs &amp; Somber Memoirs of Aubrey? was published. The book added the word ?author? amongst many other titles he has taken liability for. </itunes:summary><itunes:duration>00:33:00</itunes:duration><media:group><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/authorsharnel/2014/07/10/lets-talk-too-author-aubrey-clemons.mp3" fileSize="7704128" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/authorsharnel/2014/07/10/lets-talk-too-author-aubrey-clemons.wma" fileSize="7704128" type="audio/x-ms-wma" /></media:group><itunes:author>AuthorSharnel</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:keywords>Author Sharnel,Author Aubrey,Support,Read,Thank you</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>Let's Talk Too!

He can be considered the Thomas Edison of the 21st Century. His invention dis-assembles pathogens and disease of all kinds. Tom Paladino's research and work with the scalar energy, began during his undergraduate years. He was inspired by various scientists, i.e., Hieronymus, Moray, Priore' and especially Nikola Tesla, as to the existence of an energy that is not of the electromagnetic spectrum. With this inspiration, he pursued a course of independent study in order to better understand and subsequently harness scalar energy. Scalar energy is also known as prana, chi, radiant energy, zero point energy, qi, orgone, eloptic. After years of experimentation and modification, Tom Paladino has developed a technique using scalar energy that will transmute pathogens quickly and painlessly. This technique facilitates the use of photographs of people who desire to have pathogens transmuted in their bodies. Tom Paladino developed a treatment process whereby he is able to administer the scalar energy reverse-phase angle harmonic of a pathogen, thereby causing that agent of infection to disassemble or fall apart. Scalar energy operates at the quantum level and is capable of disassembling all types of pathogens thus eliminating the causative agent of disease. Once the causative agent of a pathogen disease has been eliminated the symptoms associated with that infection decrease or disappear altogether. RECENT DISCOVERIES: May 6, 2013 - Tom Paladino had a breakthrough with the herpes virus. August 2013 &ndash; Increased Power of the Scalar Instrument for the thirdtime in 2 years. December 2013 &ndash; Pathogens added: worms, parasites to pathogen cleanse. People and pets are now expelling worms, lice, parasites. May the world one day soon recognize this great gift from God. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Inventor Tom Paladino is our Expert Guest today.

The truth is, you're running a business and you must find ways to distinguish and market yourself, to let prospective clients know you're out there, to persuade them to give you a chance. One of the most powerful tools you have at your fingertips is video. Video builds know, like, and trust faster than just about anything else. And there is more good news: Few businesses &ndash; and even fewer lawyers &ndash; have exploited this proven medium. They think video isn't for them, or they dislike the idea of being on-camera, or the technology seems overwhelming, or they think they don't have the budget. Over 20 years ago, ?Speech & Media Trainer to the Stars,? Ruth Sherman, M.A., set out to fix that by using skills and training learned as a successful New York City performer to teach business professionals to perform on-stage and on-camera, what Ruth calls Platform and VideoCharisma. Ruth is certain about two things: First, everyone has a unique Charisma (presence) and can uncover it, enabling them to eliminate barriers, connect deeply with audiences, and convert them into high-paying customers. Second, most people won't do what it takes, so if you do, you have a default competitive advantage. Instead of boring, you become a magnet.
