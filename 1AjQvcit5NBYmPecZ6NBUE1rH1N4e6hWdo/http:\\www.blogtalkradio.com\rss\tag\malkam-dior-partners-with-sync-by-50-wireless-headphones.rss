Over the past 6 years many people have faced the foreclosure of their homes. The consensus is that they deserved to lose their homes because they bought more home then they could afford. They took more money than they could pay back is a common response. But truth be told the banks convinced the lenders they could handle it. You know Americans believe the experts even though it might not jive with people's reasoning.Let's not forget about the BILLIONS of dollars banks have been forced to pay in fines and penalties for fraudulent activities pertaining to mortgages. If they paid Billions how much did they really steal. Also manufacturing in America left for overseas and many Americans lost their only source of income, their jobs! So much of the foreclosure plague was caused by human error from the authorities greed and irresponsibility. Along comes Dess Sealy and the Bolden Pinnacle Group to legally help the owners keep their homes & their family's legacy.If the millions of people who have been foreclosed on and made to move were able to cut their mortgage payment in half and reduce their mortgage obligation to 80% of the homes current value 75% of the people would be in their homes.Many couples wouldn't be divorced and or incarcerated for doing something desperate.Friday Dess will help everyone who calls in to turn their upside down home around, to lower their mortgage payment 50% & give them 20% equity in their current home. This includes rentals also.What has been done in the dark with information is now being brought to the light.

On tonight's show Aurora, Katrina, and Zsuszi discuss their perspectives and personal experiences with Marriage, Romance and alternative relationships. We tag this episode as an "EMBRACE THE TABOO TO LIBERATE YOU!" Episode. For the WILD WOMEN of CONSCIOUSNESS. We ask and answer deep questions like "Why get married?" "Can I have multiple partners?" "Is having children the route I want to take?" In this episode you'll go down the rabbit hole to ask yourself if you do things just because they are societally acceptable. Katrina Rainsong Messenger: It seems like we all know the Marriage Fairytale, girl meets boy, dates boy, marries boy... happily ever after! Why is it that even tho we all know that relationships are more complex than that we still tend to cleave to the old paradigm? Can we change the traditional narrative? What new stories can we tell? My story is one of marriage, freedom and joy. Here's a tale from the Poly side Zsuszi Fern: Finding support, preparing Rites of Passage and being clear on what relationships mean to you is what marriage is all about. JOIN OUR NETWORK!

Do you dread having to collaborate, with the sub-text, I just wish I could have done this on my own? The Parachute Project, designed by Joss Rowlands and John Breeze, was born from a co-leading experience during the prestigious Coaches Training Institute's Leadership program. In keeping with their own greater purpose of bringing co-leadership into the world, Joss and John work with leadership partners to help them embrace the experience of creating meaningful relationship, collaboration and intimacy. This opens them up to the joy of co-leadership, which expands their own influence as leaders in their own worlds. John Breeze is a recovering engineer who's now in his fourth (or so) career and believes he may have finally got it right! John trained with the Coaches Training Institute's coaching program, then embraced the Leadership program. He's been involved in various ways with the coaching and leadership community in the last five years and was recently recruited into the Co-Active Leadership Co-Ambassador team. John works with business owners and creative self-directed professionals, helping them harness their unique strengths and talents to build a thriving business and take responsibility for their lives. Joss Rowlands is a CTI coaching grad, CPCC, and Co-Active Leadership grad. Her focus is self-mastery in the areas of intensity, complexity and drive. She brings the results (and mis-steps) of this to mentoring coaches and leaders in transition. Joss embraces the concept of Leaders holding responsibility for their worlds, while noting that these self-same words promote diversity and individuality and a greater need for the inter-dependence of spirit. Join us for a conversation that will expand your own leadership through co-leadership. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever co-led a program or project with another leader, and walked away thinking, never again?
