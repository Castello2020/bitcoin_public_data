Ironically, wars are most often fought for access to fossil fuels. Dependence on them may be our undoing. Fittingly, the military uses a greatly disproportionate amount of these fuels to keep the war machine going. Halting climate change is integral to ending war. The problem is more complicated than most people realize. Unless you have done some serious research, it is much more dangerous than you know. There is good reason to think that we are on a course to extinction of the human race. Multiple positive feedback loops appear likely to cause global climate catstrophe much sooner than we have been led to believe. Human civilization hangs in the balance. Billions will die for decisions we have already allowed others to make. However, if we can build a united international front against fascism and war to challenge the war profiteers, we will have the strength to do what can be done to assure the survival of civilization. This is the end of the world as we know it. What comes next is up to us. On SFPI Radio on July 12 at 9 AM PST/ 12 PM EST our guest will be Guy McPherson, Professor Emeritus at University of Arizona, climate change expert and outspoken advocate for drastic action to save human civilization.

And the media continues to fuel the hatred selling false headlines. William Jacobson joins Joe to discuss. Have you had your healthy dose of reality lately? There are always at least two sides to every story. Have you ever wondered how someone, who saw the same thing you did, walked away telling a vastly different story? Which version was correct? Which one was the REAL story? Actually, both are! It's just a matter of perspective. Joe takes the issues&hellip; especially the controversial issues (politics, prejudice, religion, illegal immigration)&hellip; and brings in people from different sides to share their viewpoint. This is definitely not a fluff piece. And while no one is attacked, the questions are hard-hitting. But the conversation is always respectful and you're sure to learn something new, even if you don't agree! If you've always wondered how the ?other side? thinks and how they've arrived at their ?stand?, then this is the show for you!

As we commemorate the signing of the Declaration of Independence, let's make a decision to declare our own freedom from being unforgiving. This is the beginning of a 3-part series on forgiveness.

This show will be one that you won't want to miss, and it will encourage you greatly. Ms. Luce has applied the principles of opting for a mindset change from that of victimization to that of a champion of her own life, based upon a strong will to be transformed by the renewing of her mind; to become restored to the dynamic being that she is; and to live an abundant life free from any type of bondage, prison or shackle. Her story will inspire you to become whole, and to get to a place that enables us to help others; to show up and not allow ourselves to be ?invisible?. We all have a light that must shine brilliantly. She lives by this advice: ?This life is yours so own it. Refuse to be unseen, unheard and invisible as it is your presence and voice that will help make it better. Do not allow your pain to define you or society to neglect you. Use your history as fuel to thrust you into a better tomorrow. Live with passion, share your power and speak inspirational words that help others heal.? We encourage parents, educators, clergy, therapists, child advocates, and anyone else who works with children to tune in to this show. Please join us!

Martinez, Ph.D.: The Mysterious Origins of Hybrid Man</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/earthancients/2014/06/28/susan-b-martinez-phd-the-mysterious-origins-of-hybrid-man</link><description><![CDATA[SUSAN B. MARTINEZ, Ph.D., Did we evolve from apes, or are we all descendants of Adam and Eve? Why is the ?missing link? still missing? Is the dumb luck of natural selection valid? Piecing together the protohistory of humanity through anthropology, genetics, paleolinguistics, and indigenous traditions, Susan B. Martinez offers an entirely original alternative to Darwin's evolution: Modern humanity did not evolve but is a mosaic of mixed ancestry, the result of eons of cross-breeding and retro-breeding among different groups, including Cro-Magnon, Neanderthal, hobbits, giants, and Africa's ?Lucy? and ?Zinj.? Martinez shows that there were multiple ?Gardens of Eden? and how each continent had its own blend of races prior to the Great Flood, which caused the diaspora that brought a renaissance of culture to every division of the Earth. Martinez explains Homo sapiens' mental powers (the Great Leap Forward) in cosmological terms--how we are the product of both heaven and earth. She identifies the ?Sons of Heaven? and the angel-engendered races, explaining how Homo sapiens acquired the ?blood of the gods,? which endowed us with a soul. Providing the ultimate resolution to the Evolution versus Creationism debate, this landmark study of hybrid man justifies his unexpectedly sudden appearance in the fossil record, the curious parallels between oral histories of the world's people, and why anatomically modern features are found in the earliest paleontological evidence. SUSAN B. MARTINEZ, Ph.D., earned her doctorate in anthropology at Columbia University, where she also served as a lecturer in ethnolinguistics. She is the book review editor at the Academy of Spiritual and Consciousness Studies and the author of _The Psychic Life of Abraham Lincoln_,She lives in Clayton, Georgia. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[SUSAN B.
