In honoring this unique music gift, Bunny feels a solemn responsibility to the Creator to use her voice and carry these songs to as many people as possible. From generations of a very musical-artistic family, poetry and song seemed a natural part of her life near the peach orchards and crop landscapes where she grew up in the rural farming country of Northern California. It was a slower time when people of all ages from very diverse cultural backgrounds enjoyed spending time together, sharing stories and experiences, laughing and appreciating the antics of the dogs, cats and horses living on the land. A favorite part of each day for Bunny was sunrise and sunset when she would take long barefoot walks to her favorite large, old cottonwood tree at the edge of the field near her home.

It has been a central theme in my parenting and teaching for over four decades! Over the next few weeks, I'll be sharing with you, various practices which are supportive to "Raising Peaceful Children". If you are important in the life of a child, I invite you to tune in. If inspired, call in and share an insight or a precious moment you shared with a child. PRACTICE 11: Your Core Family Values! Part 2: We'll continue the conversation about core values tonight. In addition, we'll talk about having "secondary" values, those which are important to you but not at the forefront. Knowing your Family Values and living those values, truly creates a home that reflects who you are and what is important to you! Values create a foundation for your home! Sharon Ann Wikoff is a teacher, consultant, writer, and motivational speaker specializing in the fields of parenting, communicating with young children, self-esteem and personal transformation.

Mr Elam says, "I have struggled against many things in my life including childhood sexual abuse and somehow I found a way to survive." He recently related how, as a defenseless child, only 5-years-old, a relative forced him to be a sex slave in Florida. "I was a child desperate for affection. The relative who was a predator took advantage of that, and basically coerced me into trafficking using drugs and alcohol and threats of violence," recounted Elam. He was also coerced into child ography. To outsiders though, he says he appeared to be a normal child. He even attended school. Raised in the South, he joined the United States Marine Corps at the age of seventeen and spent the next eight years seeing the world. After his enlistment was finished he attended college and graduated to work in the Biotechnology sector. Jerome continues, "Writing is my passion and it keeps me in touch with the wealth everyone holds deep inside their hearts and minds." At NAASCA, Jerome is easily one of our favorite journalists who writes on the topics of child abuse and trauma, and we feature his articles regularly on our web site. His work for the Washington Times "Communities" section is always to the point, and he frequently takes advantage of the opportunity to explain the shocking statistics pertaining to the material in his articles. NAASCA is delighted to include Jerome Elam as a card-carrying member of the NAASCA family! ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tonight's special guest is Jerome Elam, a returning NAASCA family member who's a child abuse survivor and writer for the Washington Times, Communities section. Mr Elam says, "I have struggled against many things in my life including childhood sexual abuse and somehow I found a way to survive." He recently related how, as a defenseless child, only 5-years-old, a relative forced him to be a sex slave in Florida. "I was a child desperate for affection. The relative who was a predator took advantage of that, and basically coerced me into trafficking using drugs and alcohol and threats of violence," recounted Elam. He was also coerced into child ography. To outsiders though, he says he appeared to be a normal child. He even attended school. Raised in the South, he joined the United States Marine Corps at the age of seventeen and spent the next eight years seeing the world. After his enlistment was finished he attended college and graduated to work in the Biotechnology sector. Jerome continues, "Writing is my passion and it keeps me in touch with the wealth everyone holds deep inside their hearts and minds." At NAASCA, Jerome is easily one of our favorite journalists who writes on the topics of child abuse and trauma, and we feature his articles regularly on our web site.

It has been 36 years. Long has maintained his innocence while serving one of the longest sentences for rape in the state. An all-white jury convicted Long more than 30 years ago of the rape and burglary of a prominent Concord widow, whose husband was an executive at Canon Mills. The prosecution presented a smudged shoe print but no blood, hair, paint, fiber, fingerprints or semen linking Long to the rape. The conviction was based on the eyewitness identification of the victim who pointed out Long to officers in an unusual "lineup" when police brought the victim to court to see him. All-white police officers lined the Concord court when the verdict was announced in 1976. After the verdict, protesters chanted outside the courtroom and news video shows officers clearing the courthouse swinging batons. Protesters set two homes on fire the weekend after the verdict. "What kind of justice could I receive, you understand what I'm saying, under these type circumstances," Ronnie Long told WCNC-TV in a 2007 prison interview. Nobody will ever change the condition of a people until they change within themselves. Family the burden is on us to change our behavior; to build love, trust and confidence in each other and in our people for us, then, 95% of our problems will be solved. We, as leaders must declare that we will never sell out the aspirations of our people for personal wealth, position and advancement in the society of our former slave masters and their children. We must make a covenant with our people to work and sacrifice and be willing to be the good shepherd (leaders) who will lay down our lives for our people. Let us accept our responsibility and change our behavior to that, which will make us more than comrades and brothers and Sisters! ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ronnie Wallace Long, whose racially-charged conviction triggered a riot in the mill town in 1976, is still incarcerated.
