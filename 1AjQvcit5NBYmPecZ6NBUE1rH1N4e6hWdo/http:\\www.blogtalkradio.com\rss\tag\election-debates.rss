This program is designed to redirect at risk adolescents and strengthen their chances to graduate high school. I have a passion to help people meet their personal goals and needs and this is the reason why I started this organization. Meet Jennifer Jackson Jenn Maree Styles is a brand that specializes in hair extentions, lash extentions and wigs. The hair extentions that i offer can be bonded, sewn or micro linked.

The wigs are avaiable for shipping. Myself, Jenn Maree has 10 years professional experience. The motto for my company is " Quality is key, not the price".

After a career as a prizewinning reporter, editor, and opinion writer, she now works in higher-ed communications. She served on the editorial boards of The Tallahassee Democrat (then Knight-Ridder) and The Tampa Tribune (then Media General) and edited the Creative Loafing chain's alternative weekly in Sarasota. As a journalist she won first-place awards from the Southern Newspaper Publishers Association, the Florida Press Club, Florida Academy of Trial Lawyers and the Florida Medical Association, as well as a Robert Kennedy Journalism Award for investigative reporting. She is the co-author of a book on media relations, I See Your Name Everywhere! Her first novel, Night of the Litani, set in Lebanon, received widespread critical acclaim. Mercedes Wore Black: Florida Politics. The only thing predictable is the unpredictability. When Janis is fired from her job at the newspaper, she focuses on the causes that matter to her. The environment and the economy. That embroils her in the 2014 election. When her good friend Mercedes encounters danger and is brutally murdered, Janis begins to investigate. She finds herself in a political maelstrom of big money, lottery, and interests with opposing goals. Joe Guidry, Opinion Editor at The Tampa Tribune writes; "Fast-paced, exquisitely written, Mercedes Wore Black vividly depicts the underbelly of the newspaper industry and the all-too-real shenanigans of those who are ever willing to sacrifice Florida's natural treasures" To Order: Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Mercedes-Wore-Black-Andrea-Brunais/dp/1940869102/ref=la_B001KCRN3E_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1404860431&sr=1-1 Southern Yellow Pine Publishing: http://www.syppublishing.com/ ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Andrea Brunais is a journalist with more than 20 years in the field.

My parents were fleeing their native homeland, everything they knew, everyone they knew and leaving behind all their worldly possessions to start life anew. They came to America to seek the freedom and liberties they had watched their native country lose to a power hungry charismatic leader. My father had been studying to be a surgeon and were starting out their lives when history repeated itself and a free and prosperous nation lost its way and the freedoms that they all took for granted and believed could never happen here were lost as Cuba became a communist country. I was fortunate enough to grow up in America where I learned that if you worked hard you could become anything your God given talents could take you. I became a naturalized citizen after the birth of my first child and it was a very proud moment surrounded by family and friends and a celebratory dinner afterwards. I went about my life like everyone else trying to do the best to provide for my wife and children. I had always been interested in American history and politics and felt that after Ronald Reagan and the United States had won the Cold War we had proven once and for all that our system of personal and economic liberty was the best path to prosperity. We all thought that America and our ideals were safe and went about our lives until September 11, 2001. That's the day that our security was threatened and the American people decided to freely relinquish our liberties to the government. Fast forward to 2008 and the election of Barack Obama and Democratic control of both the House and Senate. I saw and felt that things weren't quite right, our liberties were under attack and I knew it was time to act. I wrote a book to try and help Americans rediscover their history before the elections of 2010. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[I came to the United States as a legal immigrant with my parents as a 10 month old child.
