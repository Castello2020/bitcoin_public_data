Gresham and Author Richard Passman â The X-15</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/writestream/2014/07/14/military-monday-with-john-d-gresham-and-author-richard-passman-the-x-15</link><description><![CDATA[From 1947 to 1968, a series of four rocket-powered research aircraft provided American aircraft designers with the information and test data to build everything from early jet fighters like the North American F-86 Sabre, to the incredible speed, altitude, and stealth of the Lockheed A-12/ SR-71 Blackbirds. These aircraft, the X-1, X-1A, X-2, and X-15, literally took American aircraft design through the sound barrier, to hypersonic regimes above Mach 5. In addition, these aircraft demonstrated new materials, aerodynamics, systems, and even rocket engines that could be throttled. And in the case of the X-15, actually took pilots above the atmosphere and into space. Of of these amazing aircraft, it was the X-15 which was arguably the most productive and successful of the X-planes, flying 199 times and setting records which would only be broken by the arrival of the Space Shuttles in the 1980s. Flown by some of the most talented pilots of their generation, some, including Neil Armstrong, would go on to fly for NASA on Gemini, Apollo, and Shuttle missions. Today, the two surviving X-15s are prized museum exhibits, which still draw the attention of patrons from around the globe. To learn more about the X-15 rocket plane, join military historian, author and journalist John D. Gresham (@greshamj01) for Military Monday at 1 p.m. Eastern. His guest this week is pilot, engineer, and aircraft designer Robert Passman, who spent much of his career working with rocket powered aircraft and spacecraft for the NACA, NASA, the U.S. Air Force, and CIA. Along with John Anderson, he is the co-author of the new book X-15 from Zenith Press (@Zenith_Press). Together they will go through the history of the X-15, including its heritage, design, pilots, missions and legacy. Listeners are encouraged to call in and offer their own questions and opinions on this landmark aircraft, in an hour that will highlight perhaps the greatest research aircraft of all time. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[From 1947 to 1968, a series of four rocket-powered research aircraft provided American aircraft designers with the information and test data to build everything from early jet fighters like the North American F-86 Sabre, to the incredible speed, altitude, and stealth of the Lockheed A-12/ SR-71 Blackbirds.

Hudgins explains government boondoggles related to space stations, space regulation, rocketry, and rocket manufacturing supply chain issues &hellip; like depending on Russian manufacturers for all sorts of equipment. He's even done stuff with Buzz Aldrin, who walked on the moon (and memorably shouted at it with Liz Lemon). Hudgins, who spent his childhood fascinated with Space and Astronomy, interned at Goddard Space Flight Center and got to follow the first moon landing from a major space center. Since then, Space has been a passion for him. Hudgins put together his book with the Cato Institute, after a conference he designed on the Free Market and Space. Hudgins has been working on the free market in space and space travel for some time now. He points to the deregulation of the air lines that lead to lower prices for consumers. Despite the deregulation of many industries and sectors, the government maintained a monopoly on space. Elon Musk, of SpaceX has revealed a manned capsule to put humans into space. He advocates for allowing human innovation and entrepreneurship to flourish without government regulation and restriction. He encourages free, open-market solutions to space travel to make it more affordable and practical for everybody. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Michael and Edward Hudgins (of the Atlas Society) get together that about SPACE and his new book, Space: The Free-Market Frontier.

How about just kicking back and talking about cars and the automotive world while you enjoy a stiff drink, tasty brew, or a fancy cocktail? Awww thats better. We will attempt to cover all those bases in this show we present to you on Fridays! What the hell is going in new cars and the automotive culture in general? Find out with Matt and Jay every week, oh yeah and enjoy a night cap:) This week we talk about the "the hill" better known as Pikes Peak where every year hundreds of vehicles ranging from super bikes to wildly modified semi tractors try to rocket up the 12 mile 156 turn run to the summit faster than any in their class. The standing record is 8:13.878 set in 2013 by 9 time WRC champ Sebastien Loeb. While we don't expect that to fall, we do expect some amazing action out here. We run into current Pirelli World Challenge pilot Mike Skeen, and talk about his attempt this year on the hill in his insane Nissan GTR (Pikes Peak Special) - Braking up hill, and packing a parachute! We end the episode talking about our favorite summer time brews in the venerable full body IPAs. If it was good enough for pirates it's good enough for us!

Tony and I both said that the weather is finally stabilizing and getting normal. The nights are warmer, the water is warming up into the 60&prime;s, and the weeds are finally growing. fishing has been good for most species and particularly crappies, bluegills, northern pike, and walleyes. Crystal Lake near Roxbury and Sauk City is good from shore and from a boat if you can find a launching location without high water. the DNR landing is washed out and launching is possible, but you better have four-wheel drive. I know locals who fish from shore and have been doing great! A key is the new Rocket Bobber which allows you to cast much farther and reach the fish. Wayne Whitemarsh from the Wilderness Fish and Game store and a couple friends in Sauk City recently caught 75 crappies and bluegills in less than 2 hours.
