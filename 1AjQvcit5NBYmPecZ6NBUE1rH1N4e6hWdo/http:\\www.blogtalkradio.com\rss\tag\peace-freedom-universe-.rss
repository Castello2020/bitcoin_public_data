Noone wants to suffer pain, but we have forgotten how much power we have over the experience of it. As stated in lesson 190 (I choose the joy of God instead of Pain), "Pain is a sign illusions reign in place of truth." How can we let those illusions go and welcome truth? By changing our thoughts-""It is your thoughts alone that cause you pain." As we change our thoughts, we change our world, both inner and outer. The very world we perceive is a "representation of our thoughts." These metaphysical principles are basic to the teachings of the Course. And we can truly benefit from them as far more than just pretty intellectual exercises as we share them and practice them.So call in tonight and experience the healing and peace that comes from actually sharing them --experience your Self--radiant in this holy joy...forever." ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[This week, we read from and discuss Lessons 189 and 190.

Join in for this 30 minute soul re-alignment process! A transmission of channeled healing technologies which restructure your creative source grid.

Mark 12:31 "And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these."- King James Version. The most important freedom we have, according to our nation's founding, is the freedom of religion. That is why it is the first freedom that is protected in the Bill of Rights. It is true, that this First Amendment also forbids the government from respecting the establishment of religion. This, of course, means that the federal government cannot enact law deeming one type of religion, or denomination thereof, as supreme. This goes further to protect individuals to worship as they choose. This 'separation of church and state', does not mean that God, Jesus, or any religion for that matter, by law, ought to be kept out of the public.The truth is quite to the contrary. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tonight we will dive in head first to the Truth about the founding of America, the idea of America, and the future of America.
