What is happening along the borders of America and what we might face down the road from unchecked illegal immigration. Mexico just signed a special agreement with several of the Central American countries giving them a special pass if they are heading towards America, fast tracking them to our borders. The Obama administration helped create this by telling the folks in other countries that theey woud not turn away minors, and making it as easy as ossible for them to cross illegally, and now saying it is the fault of republicans because they will not do what Obama tells them to, so he will create special executive orders to "fix" the situation. With illegal drug smuggling and the violence that goes with it, the already over burdened border patrol and immigration services, we now have the current massive wave of minor and unaccompanied children which is paralyzing the border. We are in danger of not just a huge burden on our medical, economic, justice systems, but the immigrants are racing for the borders to take advantage of what they feel will be the next big amnesty wave. These new illegal immigrants are now bringing with them diseases that have not been seen here in America for many years. Many of the so called "minors" are kids 18 years old who have been part of dangerous criminal gangs for years, including murderers, rapists and current illegal gang members. What are we going to do to solve our illegal immigration problems in America? We will also give you an update on the BattleRoadUSA training schedule for the rest of the year. Call in number is 347-308-8790 Hope to see you there! -Scout ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tonight we will discuss the current immigration problems facing America.

Don West, along with Mark O'Mara, were George Zimmerman's attorneys at trial. Don West joins us today. Mr. West is a dedicated trial attorney whose career has largely been spent providing services to the indigent community. He is the former Senior Litigation Counsel for the Federal Defender's Office and supervisor of its Capital Defense Team. A criminal trial specialist, he has represented those accused of all nature of offenses. He is a former president of the Central Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, a former director of the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and a fellow member of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the National Trial Lawyers Top 100. We will also discuss updates in the case of Daniel Chong (who was incarcerated and forgotten about by DEA agents, and left for over 4 days without food or water), the Milwaukee Stabbing case, and other criminal matters. ---------- JASON K. FELDMAN spent the first five years of his career as a criminal prosecutor in Portland, Oregon where he tried over 40 cases to a jury, argued in hundreds of judicial hearings, and assisted in a capital murder prosecution. Mr. Feldman served in the District Attorney's Felony Drug and Vice Division where he mastered search and seizure law, conducted nearly 1,000 grand jury proceedings and orchestrated sting operations as well as the execution of search warrants. Mr. Feldman has steadily developed a reputation for aggressive, thorough representation of criminal defendants throughout Los Angeles County obtaining spectacular results at all phases of pre-trial as well as at trial. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[July 13 marks the one-year anniversary of the verdict in the highly-publicized trial of George Zimmerman, who was charged with the murder of Trayvon Martin.

How did I get here? I took the scenic route. I started making my own clothes when I was 9 and could probably fill a truck with ribbons won at County and State Fairs in California. Over the years this included learning about color, line, style, fabrics, fit, etc. During this time I also gained experience in marketing, training and many other skills I use every day. At age 12 I started working - as early as CA law would allow - and have worked my entire life since with the exception of a few years having and raising 3 children - 1 girl, 2 boys. It was less expensive to stay home, so I challenged myself by growing/processing food for the family, baking all of our bread and learning to knit and crochet. I ran a hobby/craft business later in life for about 4 years. My decision to open a plus size shop came about due to an illness and the resulting weight gain. I had no idea where to buy clothes, what size I needed or even who to ask. But, I was appalled with the treatment I received in most places. Plus size women are often relegated to the back room or the basement and smaller sized sales clerks can be very rude with no understanding of the problems plus size women struggle with. Athena's Closet, Inc. was designed and developed with all of these things in mind. Over the past 3 years it has become the premier plus size shopping experience in Denver with a bigger selection than most retail stores. In the entire Denver metro area there are only 2 independently owned plus size shops - Athena's Closet and Christine's Upscale Plus. Athena's Closet, Inc. "Where all the goddesses shop" 5305 E Colfax Ave, Denver, CO 80220 (303) 997-4336 ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[My name is Rosanna Griffin and I own Athena's Closet, Inc., a plus size women's consignment shop.

The Piscataquis Village Project ?was founded to establish the first compact, car free village in the United States...Though our project will not construct buildings, we will draft the street plan and simple design code, based on the best of traditional practices, that will guide the build-out of the site. Attached, durable and fire resistant buildings, no taller than a walkable height, will front on narrow streets, with continuous arcaded sidewalks offering shelter for the elderly and mobility challenged. Buildings will be arranged to create plazas, serving as markets and democratic meeting places for all classes of people, and will surround interior courtyards for more private space. All destinations will be within convenient walking distance, with vehicles garaged at the village perimeter. 375 acres of garden space, sufficiently sized for each household to raise a significant amount of food, will encompass the developed zone&hellip;The green belt, other than the area designated for vehicle parking, would also be a zone for allotment gardens, small scale agriculture, playing fields, outdoor recreation and park-like green space. Is the Piscataquis Village Project a promising way to combine the resilient, equitable, and Earth-friendly qualities essential for a sustainable future with the best of rural and village lifestyles of the past?
