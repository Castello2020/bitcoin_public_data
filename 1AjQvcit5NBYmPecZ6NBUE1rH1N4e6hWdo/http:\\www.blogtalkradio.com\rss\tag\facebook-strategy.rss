Grandmother focused that intent and energy into a synergistic wave web that moves through the time zones knitting together the new mind of the earth. At 7:30 PM Thursdays groups and individuals in the Global Prayer Network focus and send energy for the healing of the world. In this time of collective focus we hold the ideal of humanity in our minds. We collectively change consciousness that through the emanation on every cell in matter, even the Earth herself, we become a galactic effect. In this moment, we become and accept total awareness of our origin in Divinity &ndash; this empowers all energy, all life, all humanity. We become ?God is.? We experience the ?I am that I am.? Today, One Heart Song Global Prayer Network has a range of influence of over Five Hundred Million People. We invite you to join this Spiritual Consciousness Family in these moments and let us include our appreciation for the millions of communities and keepers who have led and maintained the purity of such an act and acknowledgement of humanity's divinity.

Although the American system of justice is the most-respected worldwide, it is still a system designed, and operated, by humans, which means it's not perfect. Sam, Cliff and Ethel will highlight ongoing struggles against "the system" to free wrongfully imprisoned people, and what happens when justice miscarries against an actually innocent person. Our Special Guest for tonight's show are Howell Woltz, Author of "Justice Denied, who spent 87 months in prison for a crime, he didn't commit and Alex Dabue, Coordinator for the Fully Informed Jury Association (FIJA).
