These issues cause hardships for many people and not just to the very poor. Yet life goes on as usual for the majority of people while 1 in 6 people are in poverty. Areas are drug infested. Buildings are falling down. Lots are grown up. Being safe is an issue not just at night, but during day light. Schools are being closed in communities leaving children to travel further on foot to get to and from schools. Families are living in cars. People are living on streets. Cities passing ordinances making living in cars and feeding the homeless illegal. Why isn't these things of an urgent need to solve for Americas children? Why are these things happening across America? Why aren't these things being taken care of in America by Americans for Americans children? Why does America feel the need to house children from other countries whose parents are send them to America in hopes for a better life. A better life than they are living behind? A better life than 1 in 6 Americans?

If they put down their weapons and ask for peace, they will all die, if Hamas puts down their weapons the fighting will stop. That is not a conflict, that is an attak that must be stopped. They are throwing bombs at you that may explode on your building at any moment. As you speak about it, the sirens go off and you are in a state of emergency which means you must run into shelter. That is the reality to the people living in Israel. How does anyone in their right mind say that we have no right to exist? Sounds rediculous, but yes they shout it from the rooftops and many people go along with it. The question you need to ask is What would you do if you were under attack and someone told you that you have no right to exist? Would you submit and be killed, or would you do everything in your power to stop them?

Ironically, wars are most often fought for access to fossil fuels. Dependence on them may be our undoing. Fittingly, the military uses a greatly disproportionate amount of these fuels to keep the war machine going. Halting climate change is integral to ending war. The problem is more complicated than most people realize. Unless you have done some serious research, it is much more dangerous than you know. There is good reason to think that we are on a course to extinction of the human race. Multiple positive feedback loops appear likely to cause global climate catstrophe much sooner than we have been led to believe. Human civilization hangs in the balance. Billions will die for decisions we have already allowed others to make. However, if we can build a united international front against fascism and war to challenge the war profiteers, we will have the strength to do what can be done to assure the survival of civilization. This is the end of the world as we know it. What comes next is up to us. On SFPI Radio on July 12 at 9 AM PST/ 12 PM EST our guest will be Guy McPherson, Professor Emeritus at University of Arizona, climate change expert and outspoken advocate for drastic action to save human civilization.

By taking a glimpse into the Garden of Eden, we can see God's original intention for men, women, and their partnership with one another. We can understand the differences between the genders and how we were made different on purpose, for a purpose. Discovering this divine purpose is even more fascinating when you see how it is supported by brain science, relationship research, as well as the principles and fundamentals of psychology and sociology. Want to see what the Bible truly reveals about being a wife and a husband? Join us as we dive into a totally new way of understanding the relationship between the sexes with relationship expert Jennifer Miller. She will be sharing insights from her new book, "No Longer Two: A Guide to How God Created Men, Women, and Marriage." Before and after the show, please post your questions and comments for Jory and Jennifer on Jory's Facebook Business Page. Jennifer Miller is a Christian pastor, professional counselor, and author who has dedicated her career to helping individuals, couples, and families strengthen their faith and their relationships.Her new book, ?No Longer Two: A Guide to How God Created Men, Women, and Marriage,? is a compilation of all the wisdom she has gained and shared over the years on what truly makes relationships work, as well as how to communicate across the gender gap. It reveals new insights into how men and women think and behave, while also guiding you to understand what the Bible truly has to say about you and marriage. In addition to teaching and writing on marriage and family topics, she serves as the Co-Executive Director of The Center for Living Well, a nonprofit Christian wellness ministry, based in Phoenix, Arizona with divisions in both Canada and Michigan. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[What if a man and woman becoming one is not a commandment, but really how God created us to function best?
