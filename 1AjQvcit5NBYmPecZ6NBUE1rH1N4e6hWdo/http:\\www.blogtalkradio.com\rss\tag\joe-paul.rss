It's known as LA's premier oceanfront resort and the second you enter the property, you see exactly why it got this designation. This week Peter Greenberg will broadcast from Terranea, which is celebrating its 5th anniversary. Located on the exact site that used to be home to Marineland, a theme park Peter himself remembers visiting fondly as a young boy, Terranea not only offers new and exciting things to do, but has an amazing history. Peter is joined by Allan Franz, an anthropologist and professor working with the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy who tells Peter all about the local history, including what famous show was shot right off the Peninsula in front of the hotel. Hint: One of the restaurants at Terranea is named after it. He also gets a chance to meet some of the wild falcons that live at the center. Peter talks to Joe Roy who tells him all about the history of falcons in the area and why they stay. You can listen to all of this and more on this week's epsiode of Travel Today with Peter Greenberg from Terranea Resort in Ranchos Palos Verdes. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Terranea Resort is located on the beautiful Palos Verdes Pennisula just south of Los Angeles.
