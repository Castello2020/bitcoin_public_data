Strengths, shortcomings all intractible. It would be difficult to improve if the form was so rigid. The complete belief denies the fact a human being is adaptive and likes habit. In that sense life is a process influenced as much by our attitudes as by the events and circumstance we face each day. Can most freemasons see their personal goals that will take them to the objective of insight and self improvement? Human beings are in an unassailable state of change. We are looking for 'the bigger man' and seeking to be the 'bigger man'. Behaviour of a freemason toward his brethren, family, co-workers, G-d and country reveals his state of mind. A mason is given an opportunity to hone some useful skills of observation. But to understand them, he first must discover them. Just as he discovered how to balance his bicycle and enjoy the ride, freemasonry requires a desire to learn and action and a goal; what can you do once you have the skill. Is freemasonry about having a membership card, wearing regalia and performing ritual? If it is, then we will have stripped freemasonry of unique history, an enriched philosophy and a philathropic ethos. Can a man find an ethical 'right life' through freemasonry? With commitment, dedication, opportunity and sincere mentoring he may always be in a state of incompletion but closing in on his goals. How we are known to others, should matter. So learn the meaning of hubris; what the arts can express about the human condition; how a balanced life is different and why a statisfactory life does not come from a recipe. 'A life unexamined is not worth living.' ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Most people have a belief they are complete, the full package. Strengths, shortcomings all intractible.

With commitment, dedication, opportunity and sincere mentoring he may always be in a state of incompletion but closing in on his goals. How we are known to others, should matter. So learn the meaning of hubris; what the arts can express about the human condition; how a balanced life is different and why a statisfactory life does not come from a recipe.

Mr Elam says, "I have struggled against many things in my life including childhood sexual abuse and somehow I found a way to survive." He recently related how, as a defenseless child, only 5-years-old, a relative forced him to be a sex slave in Florida. "I was a child desperate for affection. The relative who was a predator took advantage of that, and basically coerced me into trafficking using drugs and alcohol and threats of violence," recounted Elam. He was also coerced into child ography. To outsiders though, he says he appeared to be a normal child. He even attended school. Raised in the South, he joined the United States Marine Corps at the age of seventeen and spent the next eight years seeing the world. After his enlistment was finished he attended college and graduated to work in the Biotechnology sector. Jerome continues, "Writing is my passion and it keeps me in touch with the wealth everyone holds deep inside their hearts and minds." At NAASCA, Jerome is easily one of our favorite journalists who writes on the topics of child abuse and trauma, and we feature his articles regularly on our web site. His work for the Washington Times "Communities" section is always to the point, and he frequently takes advantage of the opportunity to explain the shocking statistics pertaining to the material in his articles.

I am a licensed clinical psychologist using spiritual insight to ease daily struggles and bring clarity to life decisions. The angels love us! Are readily available to us! Want to be involved in our lives! This show will demystify the angels. Who they are, how they communicate with us, how they offer guidance and support. In the second half of the hour, you are invited to call to receive an angel card reading. Please join me for an informative and inspirational time In the Arms of the Angels.
