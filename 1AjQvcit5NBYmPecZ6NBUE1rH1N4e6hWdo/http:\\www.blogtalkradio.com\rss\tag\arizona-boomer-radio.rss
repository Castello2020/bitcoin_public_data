During the World Cup Finals, a TV station in New York state interrupted the final six minutes of the game for a potentially life-saving tornado warning. The viewers, however, valued the game over their own lives and went off on that station. It begs the question: Would you care more about watching a TV show or sporting event or standing in line for a new gaming system over a potential weather disaster? There are plenty of scenarios that have played out like this, and we'll discuss the seriousness of this situation. Ikari Chaos-San is the founder and creator. Shirley is truly the Oddball Extreme. Janet is our resident Arizona Magician. Tim is the Tokusatsu Master. Plastic Kaiju is our resident Nestene Consciousness based Godzilla. Heather is Queen Kitty Serenity. MikeBoyens is our video game wizard. We'll also have appearances by our friends from the MAD HOUSE, so come and listen in!

Grateful for her training and experience in the corporate world, Paula wanted to do more for the community in the second half of her life. Like so many Baby Boomers, Paula found herself behind the times in the digital/internet technology world as well as the economic change in the United States, and had to re-invent herself by finding her voice with producing and hosting her own show and other internet radio shows/podcasts. ?My mission is to be the catalyst of information and resources for career transitioning Baby Boomers to ?Turn Their Passions Into Success? both personally and financially by utilizing the world wide web to launch their message to the masses. With my 20 years extended experience in public speaking, customer service and in the media industry, and 30 years in the corporate world I bring to you innovative media platforms to educate, inspire, and connect people who want to make difference in the world. </itunes:summary><itunes:duration>01:18:00</itunes:duration><media:group><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/authordavidclarke/2014/07/21/take-a-spiritual-journey-with-a-buddhist-baby-boomer-whos-reinvented-herself.mp3" fileSize="18590528" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/authordavidclarke/2014/07/21/take-a-spiritual-journey-with-a-buddhist-baby-boomer-whos-reinvented-herself.wma" fileSize="18590528" type="audio/x-ms-wma" /></media:group><itunes:author>David Clarke</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:keywords>spirit,spirituality,Buddhism,reincarnation,baby boomer</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>Take a spiritual journey with a Buddhist baby boomer who's reinvented herself</itunes:subtitle></item><item><title>Baby Boomers Live # 22 Dangers of Cyber Bullying Feat.

Dane has a background in solar energy. He is a former employee of Bechtel Power Corp. and was a licensed contractor in California and Arizona. He has been engaged in constant climate/geoengineering research for over a decade. His personal residence was feature in a cover article on the world's largest renewable energy magazine, Home Power. He owns a 1,600-acre ?wildlife preserve? next to Lake Shasta in northern California. Dane put all his focus, efforts and energy on the geoengineering issue when he began to lose very significant amounts of solar uptake due to the ever-increasing ?solar obscuration? caused from jet aircraft spraying in the skies above his forest home. He also noted significant decline in forest health was occurring and appeared to be accelerating. Extensive testing and research into the geoengineering issue was commenced and has continued since 2002. He is the lead researcher for www.geoengineeringwatch.org and has investigated all levels of geo engineering from stratospheric aerosol geoengineering (SAG) to HAARP. He has appeared numerous films, and radio interviews to educate the public on the extremely dire environmental and health dangers we face on a global level from geoengineering.
