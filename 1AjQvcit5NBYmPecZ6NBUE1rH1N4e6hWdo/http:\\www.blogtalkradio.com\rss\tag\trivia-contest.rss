Castle about his work utilizing historical research in the paranormal as well as his latest projects. At the end of the show, Alex will be giving away a free e-copy of her book, "The Haunted Actor" to a lucky caller who answers the trivia question correctly! James Castle was born and raised in the Brunswick/Knoxville area of Frederick County, Maryland. Instead of television or radio, James entertained and educated himself by listening to the stories of his family members and the elder members of his community. Weekends would find James looking for arrow points along the Potomac River or digging for bottles from old abandoned dump sites. James currently resides in Brunswick, MD with his wife Monica. In his limited free time, James pursues a political science degree from the University of Maryland, metal detects, researches, writes and excavates for ghosts. Known as a primary source on Brunswick area history, James conducts much research on area families and area properties. He assists the local government with historical research and often contributes to a local weekly newspaper column titled, "Living in the Past". James was introduced to the ghost excavation methodology in the summer of 2012. Since then, he has participated in ghost excavations at the Brunswick Railroad Museum, Antietam Battlefield, Knickerbocker Hotel, Gettysburg and Centraiia, PA. He has presented at the annual Ghost Excavation conference and at Virginia Paraquest. James can be reached at Jamesrcastle@comcast.net and is currently developing www.jamesrcastle.com. He is on Facebook as Jamesrcastle and you can follow him on twitter @Jamesrcastle. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Join your host Alex Matsuo at 9pm ET on July 6th, 2014 as she talks to historian James R.
