At 7:30 PM Thursdays groups and individuals in the Global Prayer Network focus and send energy for the healing of the world.

Don West, along with Mark O'Mara, were George Zimmerman's attorneys at trial. Don West joins us today. Mr. West is a dedicated trial attorney whose career has largely been spent providing services to the indigent community. He is the former Senior Litigation Counsel for the Federal Defender's Office and supervisor of its Capital Defense Team. A criminal trial specialist, he has represented those accused of all nature of offenses. He is a former president of the Central Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, a former director of the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and a fellow member of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the National Trial Lawyers Top 100. We will also discuss updates in the case of Daniel Chong (who was incarcerated and forgotten about by DEA agents, and left for over 4 days without food or water), the Milwaukee Stabbing case, and other criminal matters. ---------- JASON K. FELDMAN spent the first five years of his career as a criminal prosecutor in Portland, Oregon where he tried over 40 cases to a jury, argued in hundreds of judicial hearings, and assisted in a capital murder prosecution. Mr. Feldman served in the District Attorney's Felony Drug and Vice Division where he mastered search and seizure law, conducted nearly 1,000 grand jury proceedings and orchestrated sting operations as well as the execution of search warrants. Mr. Feldman has steadily developed a reputation for aggressive, thorough representation of criminal defendants throughout Los Angeles County obtaining spectacular results at all phases of pre-trial as well as at trial. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[July 13 marks the one-year anniversary of the verdict in the highly-publicized trial of George Zimmerman, who was charged with the murder of Trayvon Martin.
