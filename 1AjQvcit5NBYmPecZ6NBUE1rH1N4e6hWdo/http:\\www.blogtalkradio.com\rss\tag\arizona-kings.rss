In fictional television, the good guys always get the attention and stop or capture the bad guys. In the real world, however, it seems the bad guys get more attention instead. We'll talk about that Stockton, California felon getting more attention than an officer in the same city who was laid to rest the very day the felon's photo went viral on Facebook. Knowing this isn't the only situation, we'll ask why some people are more interested in the bad guys. As time permits, we'll discuss other things, too. Ikari Chaos-San is the founder and creator. Shirley is truly the Oddball Extreme. Janet is our resident Arizona Magician. Tim is the Tokusatsu Master. Plastic Kaiju is our resident Nestene Consciousness based Godzilla. Heather is Queen Kitty Serenity. MikeBoyens is our video game wizard. We'll also have appearances by our friends from the MAD HOUSE, so come and listen in! Visit our official website at http://beyondtheairwaves.weebly.com and don't forget to join in the conversation on the forums located on our official website. We want you guys and gals, the fans, to tell us what's on your mind and what you feel is important to cover, so let us know what you want to hear. **All sound effects are protected under fair use provisions and are NOT intended to create any copyright infringement.** ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is Beyond the Airwaves: The Infinity Project, where we go beyond the mainstream media and tackle issues that don't seem so important to the major networks.

Toward the end of October 2004 an ancient ceremony to heal the energy grid took place in Big Bear Valley. Immediately following the ceremony the earliest snowfall in several decades blanketed the Valley. Two weeks later a full-blown Medicine Wheel ceremony took place in Big Bear and on several points around the Southland. A post ceremony celebration took place several days later and as the celebration came to an end snow started to fall, dropping 28 inches before the storm ended. Healing of the earth, coincidence or folklore? Only a power higher than mere mortals can answer that question. Bennie LeBeau, a spiritual leader from the Eastern Shoshone Tribe, Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, performed the 6,000-year-old Medicine Wheel ceremony. He has performed similar ceremonies in other drought-striken areas of the country with similar results. LeBeau conducted a huge Medicine Wheel Ceremony in the Grand Tetons of Wyoming and surrounding points in May. The Big Bear Medicine Wheel Ceremony is a result of new visions urging LeBeau to help heal the rift between nature and humans. LeBeau is an elder spiritual leader and advisor. He studied cultural anthropology and applied indigenous studies at Northern Arizona University. He is a member of the Spiritual Elders of Mother Earth and helps to educate Shoshone Nations people and others regarding sacred sites and indigenous prophecies. The purpose of the Medicine Wheel ceremonies is to honor the Earth and her living inhabitants in all of nature's creation, according to LeBeau. The disruption of the Earth's electromagnetic energy grid has resulted in the prolonged drought, LeBeau has said. "The Medicine Wheel Ceremony doesn't create the weather, but it does enhance it," LeBeau said. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Prerecorded...

Toward the end of October 2004 an ancient ceremony to heal the energy grid took place in Big Bear Valley. Immediately following the ceremony the earliest snowfall in several decades blanketed the Valley. Two weeks later a full-blown Medicine Wheel ceremony took place in Big Bear and on several points around the Southland. A post ceremony celebration took place several days later and as the celebration came to an end snow started to fall, dropping 28 inches before the storm ended. Healing of the earth, coincidence or folklore? Only a power higher than mere mortals can answer that question. Bennie LeBeau, a spiritual leader from the Eastern Shoshone Tribe, Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, performed the 6,000-year-old Medicine Wheel ceremony. He has performed similar ceremonies in other drought-striken areas of the country with similar results. LeBeau conducted a huge Medicine Wheel Ceremony in the Grand Tetons of Wyoming and surrounding points in May. The Big Bear Medicine Wheel Ceremony is a result of new visions urging LeBeau to help heal the rift between nature and humans. LeBeau is an elder spiritual leader and advisor. He studied cultural anthropology and applied indigenous studies at Northern Arizona University. He is a member of the Spiritual Elders of Mother Earth and helps to educate Shoshone Nations people and others regarding sacred sites and indigenous prophecies. The purpose of the Medicine Wheel ceremonies is to honor the Earth and her living inhabitants in all of nature's creation, according to LeBeau. The disruption of the Earth's electromagnetic energy grid has resulted in the prolonged drought, LeBeau has said. "The Medicine Wheel Ceremony doesn't create the weather, but it does enhance it," LeBeau said. ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Prerecorded...
