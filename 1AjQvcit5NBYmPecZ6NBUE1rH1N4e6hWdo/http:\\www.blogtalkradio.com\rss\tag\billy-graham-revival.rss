The Divine Mother (the Holy Spirit, Shakti, the Phenomenal) and the Holy Father (Brahman, the Transcendental) are One. The Mother is the Voice in the silence of the Father, the One crying in the wilderness as the universal creative vibration known as Aum/Amen. So this show will be a surprise. Steve will be responding to her lead rather than leading her (as if anyone ever could!). So listen in as the Mother discusses the impact of the Tsunami of Love and what the next wave will bring. Linda Dillon channels Archangel Michael and other guests from the Council of Love to provide spiritual teachings and guidance on co-creating the New Earth. Interviewed by Steve Beckow, editor of the Golden Age of Gaia. Produced by Graham Dewyea. Music: Pachelbel's Canon and Mike Roland - Son of the Light Listen live each Thursday at 7pm ET by calling in or by clicking on the show link that appears at the start of the show.
