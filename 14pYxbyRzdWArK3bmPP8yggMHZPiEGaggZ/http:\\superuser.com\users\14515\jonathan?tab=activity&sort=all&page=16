Thanks, I have the downloads link but it displays in alphabetical order, when I need it to be ordered by date created.

no but its the same thing as that. I think it had like a box at the top of the screen and you selected the "virtual pc"s through that.

In Windows 7, how do I make the “start” menu Documents/Pictures/Music/Videos go to my Documents/Pictures/Music/Videos directory?
IF you don't like the libraries then just make it so only your My Documents folder is in the documents library and when you open the library you won't notice the difference. The same for Pictures etc.

Touchscreen over Ethernet (with video?)
I guess it would be the magic device which had an IP, do you also use the ethernet cable to internet connection to the PC or would it be just to get the video to the touchscreen?

Why did my computer refuse to turn then suddenly decide to turn on and work?
that would be very annoying if the hard drive is failing, my last hard drive failed about this time a year ago. All my vital data is synced with my dropbox, and I've just reinstalled Windows 7 2 days ago so everything is pretty much backed up, since that happened I have restarted my PC twice with nothing going wrong. Thanks for your answer.
