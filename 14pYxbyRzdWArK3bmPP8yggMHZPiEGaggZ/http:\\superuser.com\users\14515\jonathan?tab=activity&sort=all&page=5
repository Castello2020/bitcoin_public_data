I'm a 19 year old university student from the UK who is learning my way around the programming world. Interested in physics, electronics and IT as well. My aim in life to get somewhere in programming or become an astrophysicist, and live into 2100 :D

Is it possible to check Mac files for virus in a PC?
MAC and Mac are different things, one is an address used on all network connected devices, the other is a computer made by Apple.

What is the reason for CPUs being so small?
With the heatsink, laptops have very small heatsinks yet they do the job, how come desktop heatsinks are so much bigger, that they wouldn't be able to dissapate the heat from an oversized chip. With the distance between transistors, surely even just enlarging the chip by 2mm, would gain performance without a loss

@studiohack, I don't see why you have closed this? Other people are interested in (judging by the comments and upvotes). The question will stay here as long as an open question, so closing it will do nothing, especially as there already are answers.

@studiohack It obviously must have a definite answer, else they would be bigger. I hate how on SE just one person can close a question based on their opinion whether its subjective or not. The answers below seem pretty clear definitive.

Why is transfer between two SATA HDDs so slow?
I'm not using a USB drive, I was just stating that I have gotten faster file transfers from the SATA drives to a USB Drive, than I'm currently getting. And by USB drive I meant a USB stick/pen drive, but I've also got faster transfers with a dekstop HDD connected to a USB port

It's going down, now at just 900KB/s, I have copied between my USB drive and each hard drive with much faster speeds So I can't see how its the drives being the botle neck?
