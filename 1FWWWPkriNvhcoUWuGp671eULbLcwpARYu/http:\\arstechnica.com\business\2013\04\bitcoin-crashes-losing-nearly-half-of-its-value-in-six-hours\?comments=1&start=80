 <!-- cache miss --><!-- empty --> <p dir="ltr">On Wednesday afternoon, the Bitcoin bubble appears to have <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-04-10/bitcoin-tumbles-25-hours">burst</a>. As of this writing, its <a href="http://mtgox.com">current value</a> is around $160—<a href="http://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/">down from a high of $260</a>. (It fell as low as $130 today.) There is no obvious explanation for why the digital currency has fallen so far and so fast, although the market correcting after such a huge rise might be a good explanation. (Update 4:05pm CT: Bitcoin seems to have somewhat recovered and appears to be hovering around $200. Update 6:00pm CT: The exchange rate has fallen back to around $160.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some redditors have taken solace in a comment thread entitled "<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c2n5z/hold_spartans/">Hold Spartans</a>."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"This is just the market venting some pressure after these huge gains," wrote <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c2n5z/hold_spartans/c9cg43i">anotherblog</a>. "To be honest I'm glad it's happening now. If it recovers, it will demonstrate resilience in the market and give confidence to future buyers and current holders that they don't need to panic sell, reduce the chances of a crash in the future."</p>
<p dir="ltr" id="internal-source-marker_0.5470996945582044">Coincidentally, the plunge came several hours after a reddit user by the name of “<a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/bitcoinbillionaire">Bitcoinbillionaire</a>” suddenly, spontaneously decided to give away <a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1Hi9Nuh5pHCC3SkC1gH75k5AMV5hmZgdjd?sort=0">around $12,000 (more than 63 BTC) worth of the digital currency</a>. Bitcoinbillionaire rewarded 13 seemingly random redditors, then stopped the whirlwind spree after about eight hours. At the moment, no evidence links the currency's plunge with this random reddit charity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoinbillionaire <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-bitcoinbillionaire-2013-4">took advantage</a> of reddit’s <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcointip">Bitcointip</a> mechanism, which allows users to send each other small amounts of cash (usually less than $5). The mysterious benefactor appears to have given away 20 BTC (now worth slightly less than $4,000) as his or her first gift to one <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/karelb">Karelb</a>. This gift happened under a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c0yi4/i_wish_for_the_price_to_crash/">comment</a> titled: “I wish for the price to crash.” That comment now seems prophetic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A look at the account <a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1Hi9Nuh5pHCC3SkC1gH75k5AMV5hmZgdjd?sort=0">transferring all this money</a> shows that two hours before the giveaways began, Bitcoinbillionaire received 50 BTC (about $9,500) from another account without an IP address.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Business Insider</em> <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-bitcoinbillionaire-2013-4">reported</a> that Bitcoinbillionaire has left hints that he or she was an <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcointip/comments/1c1hp2/a_4680_tip_really/c9c7lm9">"early adopter,"</a> and had forgotten he or she even <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcointip/comments/1c1hp2/a_4680_tip_really/c9c7opm?context=3">had any bitcoins</a>. Not much is known beyond that, as Bitcoinbillionaire vanished as suddenly as he or she appeared.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"You've made me change my mind about this whole thing," <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c0er1/can_we_get_google_to_add_bitcoins_to_their/c9c5x16?context=3">Bitcoinbillionaire wrote</a>. "I'm done."</p>

Either way, I don't see what the problem was as it was never meant to have value outside of its ecosystem.</div><br /><br />Not to nitpick, but BitCoins are NOT a commodity. Commodities have a use, like pork bellies, gold and frozen concentrated orange juice (Sidenote: I LOVE Trading Places). The term you're looking for is &quot;speculative vehicle&quot; which don't have any use, and may not even have any value. After the old GM went bust a couple of years ago, traders would bid up the worthless shares to as much as a nickel a piece. Of course, something worth nothing can't also be worth a nickel, so it always crashed back to earth, but speculators (who are NOT the same thing as investors) would cash out before the crash and make some real money from the speculators who bought too late.<br /><br />Eventually, old GM crashed to zero for good and soon after the new GM took over the stock symbol. Absolutely nothing was gained from all the effort put into this. It just transferred money from one account to another. Unlike investments, which have profits to grow the whole pie even without trading, speculative vehicles are a zero-sum game.

It's really been helping keep the volatility down.[/sarcasm]</div><br /><br />Wasn't bitcoin supposed to be a hedge against inflation? What is this, like 100% inflation in 1 day...I don't even want to start annualizing that. And the biggest early supporters were scared of hyper-inflatoin of 10-15% in the US...</div><br /><br />It looks like just in the last 7 hours it went from a high of 266 down to 105 and is now back to 190.  To give you some idea of this.  Zimbabwe was the second worst case of hyperinflation and Bitcoin flew by that level.  Hungary in the 60's had the worst hyperinflation twice as bad as Zimbabwe and it was still 4 times smaller then this 7 hour window was about 10 times worse.<br /><br />Now you have rapid deflation where 1 Bit Coin could buy 1 Nintendo Wii at the bottom now it can buy about 2.

To give you some idea of this.  Zimbabwe was the second worst case of hyperinflation and Bitcoin flew by that level.  Hungary in the 60's had the worst hyperinflation twice as bad as Zimbabwe and it was still 4 times smaller then this 7 hour window was about 10 times worse.<br /><br />Now you have rapid deflation where 1 Bit Coin could buy 1 Nintendo Wii at the bottom now it can buy about 2.</div><br />Bitcon's problem is that it is way, way too small to be stable currency given the scope of the potential market. Not when the currencies of developed nations with yearly GDP in the trillions can be nudged around for billions in profit and/or political influence.<br /><br />Well that and there is nobody at the wheel to stabilize it by moderating the supply, or back it with even some measure of assets.

And the biggest early supporters were scared of hyper-inflatoin of 10-15% in the US...</div><br /><br /><br />The problem isn't inflation or deflation, it's extremely thin volume that leaves it vulnerable to price swings.<br />Inflation/Deflation has to deal with currency supply.</div><br />No.  Just, no.<br /><br />Inflation/deflation is only about prices.  Currency supply may affect prices, but is not the only possible source of inflation/deflation.</div><br /><br />We're going to have to disagree. Inflation/Deflation is about currency supply. If you talk about prices, then you have to talk about markets which all have their own influences including tariffs and taxation, fads, events (drought, flooding), seasons etc. Inflation and deflation are very typically slow, though Germans and Zimbabweans would argue otherwise. But it's all about money supply. That's why we don't just have CPI, but M1, M2 and to some extent M3. Those measure inflation. Not consumer prices which are over in the consumer price index. Inflation changes the economic value of a static bank account without any transactions. CPI only affects the value when things are bought by the money in the account.</div><br /><br />That is the Austrians definition all the real economist disagree with this.

Still, price is back to where it was a couple of days ago, so it is becoming more resilient.</div><br />How is a big crash (with or without recovery) resilient?</div><br />Recovering from a 50% crash on the same trading day indicates resilience, there is clearly still a value for it. It had been extremely overbought, but the massive crash did not cause investor panic or abandonment, as evidenced by the rapid recovery. If anything, investors saw it as a good point of entry.<br /><br />There is a whole other issue that could destroy the currency though. The BTC guild controls about 45% of all transaction processing. At 51% the transaction processor is compromised, this has destroyed other cryptocurrencies based on BTC. The BTC guild is implementing increasingly draconian methods to correct this issue however, if they break 50% they will cut off their getwork servers and only allow stratum connections, shedding approx. 6500Ghashes in the process. The current restrictions are already helping, but they may hit the critical threshold. But what if somebody less scrupulous than the guild gets that 30000ghashes needed for network dominance? That'll be an interesting day. Interestingly, Deepbit faced the same conundrum years ago but was undone by groups with better offers, most notibly the at-the-time fledgling guild.</div><br />No.  Nothing about a 50% crash implies resilience.</div><br /><br />Nothing except the recovery.

The value was in the anonymity, security (relatively speaking; if you get hacked...) and of course, the impossibility of a chargeback.<br />...<br />I</div><br /><br />How can this be promoted when it is so wrong! There is no anonymity in Bitcoin. There is only a large cost/time delay in discovering who someone is, but every transaction is public. It is only a matter of time before node in the network start leaking user's names.  <br /><br />Much like people are like &quot;Oh crap&quot; about old drunken facebook posts, the breadth of information available int he future will embarrass those currently int he network.</div><br /><br />User's names? You don't really know much about how a Bitcoin transaction works do you?</div><br /><br />Well, consider this, your accounts (addresses) are public. Unless you're mining, they all come from some funding source to some other address. In the US, you use Dwolla and MtGox to get BTC on a large scale (other ways work too, if you have friends in it, but then you're linked to your friend in the block chain) You can create the social/behavioral network map, and there is enough data out there to over time betray anyone. Say you get 5BTC from a friend (pre bubble) because you gave him cash. Then he spends it on Bitcoin hookers and silk road drugs. You're implicated in that. Or he buys wordpress hosting and starts postng terrorist manuals. You're implicated in that too. People that publish their address like bersl2 (1GGirZJ2mL5CtPFueUnJj74XhGWznarrP6)  ca be seached and mapped back to users. Any block chain activity immediately preceding or occurring immediately after indicate some kind of relationship.<br /><br />And it's all there in every botcoin user's database...</div><br /><br />That only works if you use the same address for every transaction (and there's some hint of personal information somewhere else you can trace to those transactions). I can generate as many hashes as I want, effectively being able to use a different one for each transaction without a username linking any of them. If you receive money from hash A to your hash X and then generated Y and transferred money to hash B from that, the block chain says A-&gt;X .... Y-&gt;B. There's nothing that links X and Y to the same person.

The value was in the anonymity, security (relatively speaking; if you get hacked...) and of course, the impossibility of a chargeback.<br />...<br />I</div><br /><br />How can this be promoted when it is so wrong! There is no anonymity in Bitcoin. There is only a large cost/time delay in discovering who someone is, but every transaction is public. It is only a matter of time before node in the network start leaking user's names.  <br /><br />Much like people are like &quot;Oh crap&quot; about old drunken facebook posts, the breadth of information available int he future will embarrass those currently int he network.</div><br /><br />User's names? You don't really know much about how a Bitcoin transaction works do you?</div><br /><br />Well, consider this, your accounts (addresses) are public. Unless you're mining, they all come from some funding source to some other address. In the US, you use Dwolla and MtGox to get BTC on a large scale (other ways work too, if you have friends in it, but then you're linked to your friend in the block chain) You can create the social/behavioral network map, and there is enough data out there to over time betray anyone. Say you get 5BTC from a friend (pre bubble) because you gave him cash. Then he spends it on Bitcoin hookers and silk road drugs. You're implicated in that. Or he buys wordpress hosting and starts postng terrorist manuals. You're implicated in that too. People that publish their address like bersl2 (1GGirZJ2mL5CtPFueUnJj74XhGWznarrP6)  ca be seached and mapped back to users. Any block chain activity immediately preceding or occurring immediately after indicate some kind of relationship.<br /><br />And it's all there in every botcoin user's database...</div><br /><br />That only works if you use the same address for every transaction (and there's some hint of personal information somewhere else you can trace to those transactions). I can generate as many hashes as I want, effectively being able to use a different one for each transaction without a username linking any of them. If you receive money from hash A to your hash X and then generated Y and transferred money to hash B from that, the block chain says A-&gt;X .... Y-&gt;B. There's nothing that links X and Y to the same person.</div><br />Have you all not heard of &quot;mixing&quot; services? Where there's a problem, there's a solution. You just have to trust the mixing service to not steal your money, but they do in effect sever the link between origin and recipient.

Inflation/Deflation is about currency supply. If you talk about prices, then you have to talk about markets which all have their own influences including tariffs and taxation, fads, events (drought, flooding), seasons etc. Inflation and deflation are very typically slow, though Germans and Zimbabweans would argue otherwise. But it's all about money supply. That's why we don't just have CPI, but M1, M2 and to some extent M3. Those measure inflation. Not consumer prices which are over in the consumer price index. Inflation changes the economic value of a static bank account without any transactions. CPI only affects the value when things are bought by the money in the account.</div><br />So tell me, what happens when you have a currency that has a slowly growing, soon to be fixed (and later decreasing) monetary base, with a user base that needs to increase at least 100 times if BTC is to become of any relevance?<br /><br />As of now, there are 10+ million BTC in the hands of what, 1 million people (I'm being generous)? If it's popularity increases 100 fold in the next decade, 100 million people will get to share 20+ million BTC. You go from an average of 10 BTC per user in the system to just 0.2 BTC in under a decade.<br /><br />What do you call that? Inflation, deflation, stability, a pyramid scheme... what?</div><br /><br />A bad joke passed off as a currency.

People don't spend; they hoard, hoping to cash in.</div><br /><br />There are currently an average of 300,000 bitcoins transacted every day. For a currency that has 20 million coins total, that is not bad at all. That means every ~two months the entire worth of bitcoin is involved in a transaction. That is not what I would call hoarding.</div><br />I don't see how that proves anything.  Could be 600,000 bitcoins get traded every 2 days, and the rest just sits there.</div><br />And this says what?  Gold is an extremely available commodity despite the fact that most countries maintain a heavily guarded vault to store gold they intend to keep OFF the market.  These vaults are the oft mentioned National Gold Reserve.<br /><br />The key to a liquid market is active trading ... even if the market involves only 1% of the total of a commodity, that commodity is liquid as long as active trading continues.<br /><br />For BTC there are the high profile exchanges and the much lower profile money changers.  That second category flies under the radar, but in fact are easier to use.  Just send them a text, meet at a cafe for coffee and buy or sell your BTC.  No user accounts to manage, no risk of a wallet being hacked...just a quick off the record change of currency type.

From the other side of a transaction this sort of thing strongly urges me NOT to spend the BTC I hold. It is going to continue to strangle the actual economy that may be attempting to use the BTC.

When you both agree on the price you will buy/sell at, the value is set for that trade.  All the trackers do is report these agreed on numbers.<br /><br />Stock exchange values work this way.  Sellers offer stocks and state the price they are willing to accept.  Buyers post want orders with the price they are willing to pay.  Traders scan both lists and match those that are willing to pay with the ones that are willing to sell at the offered price.  The Big Board then reports the trade amounts as a moving average of these buy/sell transactions.  If the sellers hold out for more money, then trading slows until they settle for less or the buyers start paying more.  This is the behavior that drives the prices up and down.<br /><br />Money is traded the same way.  Someone holding Euros will post a buy order for US Dollars ... A Euro buyer holding dollars will post a sell order stating what they will accept ... when both find a trading partner who agrees the price is good, they trade.  Central Banks manipulate these markets by entering their own buy and sell orders for extremely large amounts.<br /><br />The stock markets and commodity exchanges are subject to this manipulation also.  Just look at the way the price of oil follows OPEC's behavior to see an example.  Gold is also subject to the vagaries of supply and demand.  Let a government announce they are selling off a portion of their gold reserves and the market panics at the dumping ... let a government announce they are building up their gold reserves and the market reacts to the announced hoarding.

      As always, lots of speculation and misinformation in the comments here. People want to hate on something and say &quot;I told you so,&quot; but the smartest people I know are incredibly excited about BTC and every day there are new stories cropping up about new retailers and services accepting it. We've had numerous requests to have it as a payment method in our online [retail] store, so we'll be implementing it as soon as our new site is ready to launch. Really excited to see how often it is used.
