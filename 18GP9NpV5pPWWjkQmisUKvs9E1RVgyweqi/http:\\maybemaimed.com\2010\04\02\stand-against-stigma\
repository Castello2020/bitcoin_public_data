			<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><p>I have marched in two Pride Parades. Both times, I marched with the group of people who are skilled enough with that most iconic symbol of sadomasochistic sex to make some serious noise: the single tail whip. I remember the experiences vividly. Pride day is a good day.</p>
<p>I raise my arm, swing the whip, and out comes a force so sure and strong that it breaks the sound barrier. It&#8217;s hard to forget walking in the middle of New York City&#8217;s Fifth Avenue, surrounded with 25 to 50 feet of empty street on all sides, cracking whips above my head so loudly that the sonic booms bounce off the skyscrapers and echo back at me. It&#8217;s one of the most self-empowering memories I have: &#8220;I am not afraid to be seen here,&#8221; I thought to myself.</p>
<p>In both parades, I was one of the few bottoms who marched, <em>wielding</em> a whip. In both parades, I walked shirtless, showing <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/06/24/pride-and-marks-and-marks-of-pride/">marks acquired in scenes the night before</a>. I turned heads.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t show, or even get, marks like the ones I had during NYC Pride 2005 and 2007 often but, having had them, and having the opportunity to march with the whip-cracking contingent, I thought it important to be visibly proud of them.</p>
<p>In New York City, the <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/494491786/a-couple-embraces-in-front-of-st-patricks">Pride Parade on Fifth Avenue crosses directly in front of St. Patrick&#8217;s Cathedral</a>. It&#8217;s there where most protesters—and a number of photographers—choose to gather. Both years when I marched, the protesters were a small and rather calm-looking group of people who seemed almost more interested in getting a front row seat for the parade than in, y&#8217;know, protesting anything. Perhaps that was because it was, after all, New York City.</p>
<p>But I have heard stories, both on the news and from friends, of less civil behavior.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/discrimination/pages.aspx?id=153">2008 Hate Crimes Survey conducted by Human Rights First</a>, an international human rights watchdog group:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/discrimination/pages.aspx?id=153"><p>Available data indicates that violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity bias is a significant portion of violent hate crimes overall and are characterized by levels of physical violence that in some cases exceed those present in other hate crimes.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the 2003 World Legal Survey conducted by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), consensual homosexual sex was illegal in 77 countries. <a href="http://publicagenda.org/">Public Agenda</a>, a US-based, non-partisan, non-profit research organization, <a href="http://www.publicagenda.org/charts/countries-where-homosexuality-illegal">republished this data in early 2009</a>, but a few months later the ILGA released a report entitled <a href="http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/1251"><cite>2009 Report on State-sponsored Homophobia</cite> that lists <em>80</em> countries where homosexuality is illegal</a>, of which 5 list any homosexual act (presumably regardless of consent) as punishable by the death penalty.</p>
<p>If the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/10/15/uganda-anti-homosexuality-bill-threatens-liberties-and-human-rights-defenders">Anti-Homosexuality Bill in Uganda</a> is passed, that number will go up. Again.</p>
<p>I am supremely fortunate to live in America today. Whether because of my self-identification as a bisexual man, a sadomasochist, an atheist, or any number of other possible labels, if I lived in any of dozens upon dozens of other countries around the world, I would be a criminal merely for existing.</p>
<p>I am <em>not</em> a criminal. But, even in America, I <em>am</em> a target. Why? I think it is because I have marched in two Pride Parades and I have come away from them with this conviction: <strong>I am not afraid to be seen here.</strong> Neither the choice I made, nor the repercussions of it, have been easy for me.</p>
<p>As many of you are no doubt aware by now, over the course of the last week I have been shocked into reluctant action by <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2010/03/24/the-salvation-army-incites-personal-attacks-against-me-a-blog-reply/">vicious insinuations of criminal behavior written by Donna M. Hughes and Margaret (Barber) Brooks</a> likening me and the <a href="http://kinkforall.org/?p=137">work I do supporting community-based sexuality education initiatives like KinkForAll</a> to organized human trafficking and child sex slavery. The awful, frightening (and no doubt frightened) ignorance that these two university professors displayed shook me to my very core.</p>
<p>I have had to seek legal counsel because Donna M. Hughes&#8217; and Margaret Brooks&#8217; carefully crafted &#8220;bulletin,&#8221; a 6-page personal assault laced with corrosive language, has already incited several bloggers to name me a pedophile and sexual predator, which are unquestionably defamatory statements. I am continuing to explore all possible legal avenues for defense and protection, both for myself and those I work with. I want to thank everyone who has written to me, whether privately or publicly—but especially publicly—offering support, encouragement, and resources.</p>
<p>Many of you have described admiration for my rational responses to the unwarranted attacks by Donna M. Hughes, Margaret Brooks, and their mob. I want you to know that I am not totally unafraid or magically equanimous—how could I be? I feel terrorized by these people! That&#8217;s why I had no choice but respond the way I did: any action other than an attempt to allay fear, both my own and theirs, would cause more fear. And <em>I will not succumb to the same sorts of fears plaguing those who attack me</em>.</p>
<p>No matter what the outcome of these current tribulations, <strong>I am not going to be the hero in this story. <em>You are.</em></strong> I have always and will continue to always <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2009/11/23/sexual-adultism-at-kinkforall-washington-dc/">stand for the rights of all individuals to live free, sexually knowledgeable and well-educated lives</a>. What I am writing today is not unique or surprising. It is expected of me, and it is old news. Heroes do not make old, predictable news.</p>
<p>What is new, what is unexpected, what is heroic is how <em>you</em> will respond. What will <em>you</em> do in your day-to-day lives to make the world a place where all people, regardless of race, creed, or age, are empowered to <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/474514518/a-shirtless-man-with-a-bloodied-back-kneels-in">stand up against abuse, intimidation, and coercion</a>? Will you <a href="http://streetharassment.wordpress.com/2010/04/01/sexual-assault-awareness-month-10-ideas-for-activism/">speak up against the next street harasser you see shouting lewdly at women</a> walking by him? Will you <a href="http://www.realadultsex.com/archives/2009/12/bdsm-vs-corporal-punishment-challenging-stereotype">break the cycle of corporal punishment</a> by talking to an aunt who wants to hit her child? Will you <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-32369-Minneapolis-Civil-Rights-Examiner~y2010m3d1-LGBT-students-face-harassment-in-schools">stand beside your gay, trans, intersex, or genderqueer friends</a> when others ridicule them? Will you <a href="http://KinkOnTap.com/?p=580">elect government officials who care more about your physical health in this life than your moral well-being in the afterlife</a>?</p>
<div style="float:right;text-align:center;"><a href="//maybemaimed.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/same-sex-marriage-fear-sound-familiar.jpg"><img src="http://maybemaimed.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/same-sex-marriage-fear-sound-familiar-300x225.jpg" alt="A same-sex marriage counter-protestor holds a poignant sign." title="same-sex-marriage-fear-sound-familiar" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-1495" /></a><br /><small>(via <a href="http://www.sushiesque.com/photos/boston_common_031104/dscn1433.html">sushiesque.com</a>)</small></div>
<p>Those are heroic acts you can take and all of them are deviant; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsFEV35tWsg">heroism is not the adherence to conformity but the courage to deviate from it</a>; <a href="http://vimeo.com/9518765">unity cannot be achieved through homogeneity but diversity</a>; bravery is not the absence of fear but the ability to stand tall <em>in spite</em> of it, for what the fear-mongers and the fearful surely know is that fear and intimidation have the power to halt action. When people like Donna M. Hughes and Margaret Brooks use fear tactics to incite moral panic, whether it was about interracial marriage in the 1930&#8242;s, about homophobia in the 1950&#8242;s, or about sex education more recently, ask yourself if they are really fighting to change the status quo, or fighting to keep it.</p>
<p>Today, I need to stand taller, to speak louder, and be stronger than ever before. I am not afraid to be different, to showcase our differences, or to support others&#8217; rights to be, to live, to learn, and to love differently from me. <a href="http://sexinthepublicsquare.org/ElizabethsBlog/when-stigmas-collide">By being visibly proud of my differences I am fighting against stigmas</a> that people would try to intimidate me with.</p>
<p>I thank Donna M. Hughes and Margaret Brooks for showing me the importance of standing up and loudly proclaiming who I am: a middle-school drop out, <a href="//maymay.net/blog/2008/01/05/letter-to-daniel-gilbert-harvard-psychologist/">a diagnosed bipolar person</a>, a sexually submissive man, and a sexuality education community tool-builder. Ladies, you may think these things discredit me but you are wrong. They give me a perspective you cannot have. I can only hope that you find it in yourself to respect it in me.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://sexgenderbody.com/content/bed-blue">the words of The Book of Blue</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://sexgenderbody.com/content/bed-blue"><p>[E]veryone has a world where they express the depth of their self, whether it’s in their mind or they can also bring their body. Many people wonder or fear if their secret world is too strange or embarrassing to reveal. […] I am reaching right for the part of you that knows that you need to acknowledge and reveal yourself. I am here to help you create a space in your mind where you know that it’s safe to have this kind of freedom with yourself, and to share yourself and what you’re feeling with a loving witness. Not just safe but inevitable.</p></blockquote>
<p>With that in mind, <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2010/03/27/addressing-donna-m-hughes-and-margaret-brooks-concerns-over-kinkforall-unconferences/">Donna M. Hughes and Margaret Brooks, my invitation to a discussion still stands</a>. Show me that you are not afraid. Show me that you care about encouraging the kind of education the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTlrSYbCbHE">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> says we all have a fundamental human right to: <a href="http://vimeo.com/7783159">education that promotes peace and understanding among <em>all</em> people</a>.</p>
<p>Be the unexpected heroes our children and our children&#8217;s children need you to be. <em>Yes you can</em>.</p>

Led by guidelines and rules and scriptures and fear of deity, having been proud followers and stripped of initiative to create, or any sense of personal responsibilty, utterly relying on powers greater than them, these people do not hear you. They do not have the neurons to interpret if they do hear, so they do not listen, they speak a language in which freedom means their duty to attack in the name of piety and grand morals, a language which spawned xenophobic fear of diversity and real unity, a language which drives surrender and prayer and excludes confidence and empowerment, a language that fiercely &#8220;protects&#8221; what is known and as fiercely rejects the unknown. These ladies/professors and alike cannot yield to your approach, reasoning, or truth, as long as you declare your pride and support of what they believe is inherently evil. THEY are a lost case. No, Hell they can&#8217;t. The sooner everyone really understands the limit of everyone&#8217;s potential, the better chance for best communication will be possible.</p>

I have given Donna M. Hughes and Margaret Brooks two chances now. Let&#8217;s not close the door on them; I believe I can keep myself safe, continue to work towards the safety, freedoms, and education of all people, and yet remain welcoming to these professors, despite similar doubts that you have.</p>
<p>The onus is on our attackers to prove us wrong, if they insist.</p>

The real value of your approach, opening the door to a dialogue, is that those who you fight for, and it is a fight, will recognize the fact that you are standing on a ground higher than those who fight you in this war, and it is a war, even if you never meant for it, even if you never declared it. It is a myth to believe that a war needs two sides to be fighting. Fact is that when a war is declared by one side, and then fought actively by that side, war is upon you, and ENEMIES you then face, like it or not. I do not profess to be aggressive or offensive, nor do I suggest to ignore attacks, or to even trick attackers into subbordinarion or inaction, or manipulate the situation in any way to your benefit and of those you protect. All these methods are open to be use one way or another. What I insist on is to use your resources responsibly to KNOW THY ENEMIES. Open the door as you may, the very words you utter to them here and in so many other venues, and the very images you promote, your very mere existance is interpreted by them as offensive to the core. It is no more an issue of chance giving, paying respect, fair fight, or even practical diplomacy, than an issue of survival. Do not kid yourself, and elude to fanciful spirituality, like the Inquisition in medieval Spain these attackers will do all they can to hunt you to the burning stake. Your own openness should not lead you to believe that openness is inherent to all human beings, as those who attacked you have no tollerance at all towards what you ask of them: to change. Let&#8217;s be open to realism and accept that oil and water will remain un-mixable, at least for the forseable future.</p>

Anyone who read your journal for a few days could see that it&#8217;s all about consensual for you, all about people being true to their desires and expressing their own sexualities rather than being coerced or manipulated into being something they are not.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s <em>so important</em> that we all speak out, stand up, and band together against misinformation and fear-mongering like this. As more people write about this issue, it becomes less dangerous for individuals like you and me, so anyone still hiding in fear of attacks like this will have no reason not to be visibly proud of who they are or how they live. They won&#8217;t stand out. They won&#8217;t be ridiculed. They won&#8217;t be falsely lumped in with abusers.</p>

Donna Hughes and her minions are not truly feminists, at least not in the third-wave sense that many women these days ascribe to &#8211; myself included.  Keep writing.  You have such a strong point of view and you express it thoughtfully and clearly.</p>
<p>BTW, I&#8217;m a friend of Maja&#8217;s &#8211; we met several years ago before I had any RL involvement in BDSM &#8211; though I don&#8217;t know that you&#8217;d remember meeting me.</p>

Are you gay?’ (‘schwul’ in our language), I asked them why they seemed so prejudiced and if they didn’t know any gay people.</p>
<p>Just to share my miniature heroism of the week.</p>
<p>I did it because I had before witnessed someone else speaking up in a similar situation, and because I always think how awful it must be for a boy who actually is attracted to other boys to find himself among this sort of homophobic banter.</p>
<p>You already know that I too think you do good things, Maymay. But since you’ve suffered from attacks by people who really should do their research before making up accusations, I’ll repeat that I think you write and speak thoughtful, nuanced and innovative contributions about non-mainstream sexualities and about sexuality in general, and that you and all the other various KinkForAll unorganisers and contributors are doing good things with discourses about sexuality &amp; its intersections with the rest of life in innovative, collaborative and individually empowering forms.</p>

<p>I noticed that, too, <a href="#comment-34618" rel="nofollow">Not Your Bottom</a>, and I&#8217;m encouraged at how many people are expressing interest in writing publicly about their disagreement with Donna M. Hughes&#8217;s positions. There are obviously many issues to address in her and Professor Margaret Brooks&#8217;s insinuations, as they have taken the opportunity to object to KinkForAll using the intersection of two realms of moral self-righteousness: sex-negative proselytizing and youth sexuality fear-mongering. Their actions are, in fact, eerily similar to what I describe as <a href="http://vimeo.com/7783159" rel="nofollow">the symptoms of sexual paranoia in my Sexual Adultism presentation</a>.</p>
<p>As for what you can do, if you have a blog, write a post about this issue and link back here. If you see others writing about this issue, comment on their posts (you&#8217;ve already commented here, which is a start I thank you for). Talk about the issues this circumstance raises: why are <a href="http://sexinthepublicsquare.org/ElizabethsBlog/what-to-do-if-attacked-by-donna-m-hughes-and-margaret-brooks" rel="nofollow">politically conservative &#8220;feminists&#8221; so opposed to sexuality education</a>; why are <a href="http://www.thesexcarnival.com/2010/04/academics-donna-m-hughes-and-margaret-brooks-confuse-sex-education-with-human-trafficking/" rel="nofollow">academics so frightened by the relatively open format of an &#8220;unconference&#8221;</a>; why are <a href="http://lalibertine.blogspot.com/2009/08/sets-blood-boilin.html" rel="nofollow">anti-porn &#8220;feminists&#8221; consistently silencing the voices of women who <em>voluntarily</em> work in the sex industry</a>; why are these <a href="http://www.amptoons.com/blog/archives/2010/04/06/salvation-army-attacks-sex-positive-activist-through-its-human-trafficking-email-list/" rel="nofollow">politics driven by classic &#8220;BDSM is sick&#8221;</a> and <a href="http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2010/04/07/keeping-americas-children-safe/" rel="nofollow">&#8220;think of the children&#8221; moral outcries</a>?</p>
<p>Talk about it in blog comments, on Twitter, on Facebook, <em>everywhere</em> you can, and call Donna M. Hughes out by name when you talk about it. Because one thing is certainly clear: having tacitly declined my repeated invitations to converse, Donna M. Hughes and Margaret Brooks have shown no interest in talking <em>with</em> us, only <em>about us</em>.</p>
<p>Moreover, I think all of these conversations are important ones to have. So, let&#8217;s have them ourselves, consistently calling on Donna M. Hughes and Margaret Brooks to join in by mentioning their names and actions until these self-professed <em>educators</em> recognize the importance of engaging constructively instead of spreading misinformation and stigmatizing public educational efforts.</p>
<blockquote cite="#comment-34618"><p>Like everybody else commenting here, I admire your courage and generosity of spirit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you. The support you and others have shown means more to me than you might know.</p>

Unfortunately this kind of criticism can be so disheartening but we must not let it dissuade us from doing good work. I think educating the community is the most important way to challenge these prejudices. The accusations of abuse and child slavery were absurd, in fact hollistic sex education is the best way to keep young people safe from abuse and to help them understand that any sexual activity they partake on should involve safety, respect and consent.<br />
I work doing sexual education myself and there is much evidence that young people in countries where there is good sex education are much less likely to end up with unwanted teen pregnancies and STI&#8217;s so these conservatives are really living in a fantasy world if they think not talking about these issues will make them go away!</p>
