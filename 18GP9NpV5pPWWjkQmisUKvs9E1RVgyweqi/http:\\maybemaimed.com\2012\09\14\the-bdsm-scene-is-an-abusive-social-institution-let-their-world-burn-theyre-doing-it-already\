<blockquote cite="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/31532332535/four-lists-arranged-in-columns-describe-traits"><p><a href="http://delvingintodeviance.com/2012/09/15/the-intersection-of-performative-masculinityfemininity-and-dominancesubmission/"><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_macod09C4e1qzs83po1_500.jpg" alt=""/></a></p>
<p>Four lists, arranged in columns, describe traits commonly associated with &#8220;men,&#8221; &#8220;women,&#8221; &#8220;dominants&#8221; and &#8220;submissives,&#8221; respectively. The column labeled &#8220;Act like a man&#8221; bears striking similarities to the column &#8220;Act like a dominant,&#8221; while the column labeled &#8220;Act like a woman&#8221; closely resembles the items in the list marked &#8220;Act like a submissive.&#8221;</p>
<p>This image is the heart of a post called &#8220;<a href="http://delvingintodeviance.com/2012/09/15/the-intersection-of-performative-masculinityfemininity-and-dominancesubmission/">The intersection of performative masculinity/femininity and dominance/submission</a>,&#8221; published today by Dev. It&#8217;s a brilliant piece illustrating the hegemonic prejudices plaguing both the mainstream and the BDSM worlds. <a href="https://twitter.com/maymaym/status/246664647648870400">Reading it nearly brought me to tears</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you can see, how to act like a man neatly maps onto how to act like a dom, and how to act like a woman neatly maps onto how to act like a sub. In this way, heterosexual M/f couples (male dominant, female submissive) wherein the man is a sadist (enjoys giving pain), and the female a masochist (enjoys receiving pain) can easily perform their two roles flawlessly at the same time. This is exemplified by the wildly popular Fifty Shades of Grey. This book is able to be so easily consumed because <a href="http://pennyred.blogspot.com/2012/04/chains-of-oppression-katie-roiphe-lena.html">it doesn’t trample on anyone’s preconceived notions of what it means to be male or female, dominant or submissive</a>. The M/f couple then, can be at the top of the BDSM hierarchy, with the male dominant on top of course because he’s dominant (and dominants are supposed to be superior).</p>
<p>Where do female dominants and male submissives land in this hierarchy? Female dominants get a higher place in the BDSM hierarchy than male submissives because even though they are stepping outside of the ‘act like a woman box’ 1) they too are dominants, which are intrinsically better than submissives according to our boxes, and 2) they are taking on masculine traits, which lifts their status rather than lowers it. Therefore, the hierarchy is topped by male dominants, then female dominants, then female submissives, and then male submissives. The latter group find themselves at the bottom of the heap because, like female dominants, they cannot reconcile their two roles, but unlike femdoms their new role takes them down a peg rather than boosting them up the ladder.</p>

<p>(Link in the quotation added by me.)</p>
<p>I rarely blog simply to say, &#8220;Go read this other thing,&#8221; but this is important enough to do exactly that. Please, please, please go <a href="http://delvingintodeviance.com/2012/09/15/the-intersection-of-performative-masculinityfemininity-and-dominancesubmission/">read Dev&#8217;s post</a>. It not only contains further analysis of the <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/5498352136/an-opulently-dressed-man-in-greek-inspired">sexism inherent in mainstream BDSM culture</a> (yes, <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2011/03/20/fetlife-considered-harmful/">even subcultures have a mainstream</a>), it offers some generic advice for &#8220;throwing out the bad&#8221; and &#8220;keeping what works.&#8221; Just the other day, I published a <a href="http://days.maybemaimed.com/post/31423312433/public-service-announcement-for-submissive-men-and">&#8220;PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT for submissive men&#8221; (and other marginalized peoples)</a> that I feel is equally important to associate with this post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The BDSM Scene is an abusive social institution that <a href="https://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2012/03/23/theres-a-war-on-part-1-troubles-been-brewing/">provides structural cover for rapists</a>, has <a href="http://sexandthe405.com/fetlife-is-not-safe-for-users/">economic incentives to silence survivors of sexual assault</a>, and <a href="http://days.maybemaimed.com/post/30606054306/lets-get-practical-care-about-internet-privacy">contains numerous for-profit businesses actively invested in the exploitation of its own members</a>. Unfortunately, many <a href="http://tacit.livejournal.com/359244.html">assailants hold positions of power within the community</a>, which makes it extremely difficult to talk about without being ostracized from the community.</p>
<p>No matter what they say, <a href="https://kinkinexile.wordpress.com/2012/08/31/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/">the BDSM community does NOT hold a monopoly on your sex life nor on your ability to play safely</a>, or to find partners who you love and who will love you. The BDSM community is by and large only supportive of people who are white, heterosexual, class-privileged, cisgendered, conformant to hegemonic societal ideals of beauty, able-bodied, and so on.</p>
<p><a href="http://days.maybemaimed.com/post/16036372049/the-bdsm-scenes-whiteness-is-classism-at-work">The BDSM Scene’s whiteness is classism at work supporting sexism and racism</a>. Anyone who tells you otherwise is selling something. I strongly urge everyone interested in BDSM sexuality to AVOID AND DISASSOCIATE with any and all formal leather/kink/BDSM/fetish organizations in your area.</p>
<p><a href="http://oddlilpup.livejournal.com/4633.html">This is even more important for submissive men</a>, trans people, old women, and fat women, <a href="http://overland.org.au/previous-issues/issue-208/feature-matt-cornell/">all of whom are routinely used and discarded in both mainstream culture and the BDSM community as nothing more than a butt of a joke</a>.</p>
<p>We deserve better. You deserve better. These people have no interest in doing right by you; <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMcommunity/comments/zcxz0/the_blog_of_the_fetlife_hacker_criticism_of/c63rbzs">most of them are nothing more valuable than privileged shits</a>.</p>
<p>I urge you, <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2011/12/04/on-being-bondage-furniture/">from the bottom of my heart and a deeply personal place</a> of empathetic experience, <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2011/07/16/on-letting-the-world-burn/">let their world burn</a>. They’re doing it already; they don’t even need <a href="http://days.maybemaimed.com/post/31409415461/screen-grab-of-an-image-posted-on-a-fetish">the media to make them look bad</a>. Their behavior, abuse cover-ups, and rape apologism <a href="https://twitter.com/maymaym/statuses/237532790466424832">mimics the catholic Church</a>, now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of this is hyperbole. As <a href="http://delvingintodeviance.com/2012/09/15/the-intersection-of-performative-masculinityfemininity-and-dominancesubmission/#comment-250">I said in a comment on Dev&#8217;s post</a>, the &#8220;links […] provide details about each assertion made.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have been in an <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2012/07/16/never-ever-assume-you-need-permission-from-a-dominant-person-to-speak-to-a-submissive-person/">epistemically abusive</a> relationship <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/08/04/what-sexuality-might-taste-like-if-you-were-a-submissive-man-in-2007/">with the BDSM Scene for far too long</a>. Enough. The BDSM Scene and its privileged shits can <a href="https://twitter.com/maymaym/statuses/218070017143611393">go frak themselves</a>. And I hope they do.</p>

I really appreciate this.  As a female who tends towards dominance rather than submission and loves a wonderful male who tends towards submission rather than dominance, I have had difficulty feeling comfortable looking at the kink/BDSM communities online and locally.  Your post gives a good summary as to why.</p>

Do you masturbate when you cry? Take this quiz, and you&#8217;ll be just one step away from learning how to tune out life&#8217;s constant beatings so you can embrace contentment! Question 1: which makes you want to masturbate without crying?</p>
<p>Option A: Male submission, fuck yeah! Fucking! Sex! Hotness! <a href="http://fuckyeahmalesubmission.tumblr.com" rel="nofollow">http://fuckyeahmalesubmission.tumblr.com</a></p>
<p>Option B: &#8220;Art and visual erotica that depicts masculine submission. We showcase beautiful imagery where men and other male-identified people are submissive subjects.&#8221; Just kidding! Blah blah blah nobody loves me. Powerpoint lists! Art! *sadface* Blah! Oh god I&#8217;m aging! Blah, blah, blah! Blah! *cries* Blahhhhh. Oh yeah and blah blah. Blah. <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/" rel="nofollow">http://malesubmissionart.com/</a></p>

<p>Well, you&#8217;ve got rather Ironic timing (or perhaps I do.)  I&#8217;ve just finally begun to give the local scene here a bit of a go.</p>
<p>I agree with a fair amount of what you&#8217;ve observed here, but, is the scene universally that bad? I bet you&#8217;ve actually been to more Seattle BDSM things than I have so far, and i want to know how was your experience up here?</p>
<p>I already have every intention of not letting mainstream BDSM tell me how or who I need to be, do you think I&#8217;m going to get more harm than benefit from involving myself here?</p>
<p>The thing is I&#8217;m trying to get past the <a href="http://seattletimes.com/pacificnw/2005/0213/cover.html" rel="nofollow">Seattle Freeze</a>, and social groups are a good way to do that, It would be nice for me if I could make some friends with whom I am comfortable being open about this aspect of myself, and I&#8217;m unsure how I could possibly do that while isolating myself from the Scene.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I might be interested in some casual play, and my apartment isn&#8217;t an ideal location for that, The CSPC on the other hand seems pretty decent.</p>
<p>And finally, This &#8220;something better&#8221; that we all deserve, how is it supposed to come about? Shouldn&#8217;t we be working to change the scene from the inside, rather than rounding up our s&#8217;more supplies and cheering its destruction?</p>

<p>Yes, <a href="#comment-451473" rel="nofollow">Peroxide</a>, it is. From New York to San Francisco, from Boston to <a href="http://maybemaimed.com/2008/03/05/fetish-fashion-is-the-same-no-matter-where-you-go/" rel="nofollow">Sydney, and all the places I&#8217;ve experienced it</a> in between, The Scene <em>is</em> that bad.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t predict the outcome of your personal journey, but I will offer you <a href="http://delvingintodeviance.com/2012/09/15/the-intersection-of-performative-masculinityfemininity-and-dominancesubmission/#comment-255" rel="nofollow">this reminder</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://delvingintodeviance.com/2012/09/15/the-intersection-of-performative-masculinityfemininity-and-dominancesubmission/#comment-255"><p>I wouldn’t recommend FetLife [or the Scene] as a resource to any non-switching submissive man (I left the Scene with considerably more baggage than when I entered)</p></blockquote>
<p>My experience matches Oddlilpup&#8217;s, quoted.</p>
<p>Are you a non-switching submissive man? Are you someone with normative ideals and beliefs regarding your sexuality and its intersection with other aspects of your life? I know from reading your blog that you are probably not. Therefore, the odds are very much against you.</p>
<blockquote cite="#comment-451473"><p>This “something better” that we all deserve, how is it supposed to come about?</p></blockquote>
<p>Good question.</p>
<blockquote cite="#comment-451473"><p>Shouldn’t we be working to change the scene from the inside, rather than rounding up our s’more supplies and cheering its destruction?</p></blockquote>
<p>No, we shouldn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m here for the s&#8217;mores.</p>

There are people whose personal experience with the scene does not reflect your own, perhaps they are even within the groups you site as being more likely to be harmed by the organised BDSM scene. Calling for them to jump ship, with out providing an alternative is likely to be met with incredulity and derision, which I&#8217;m sure you can handle, but seems to me likely to hamper a major exodus from the scene.</p>
<p>New people are discovering kink all the time, what are the supposed to do if not look for information and connections in the currently available networks and communities.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be all for a smart, conscientious community that was open to all orientations and roles, that shut out abusers and protected it&#8217;s members rather than its image.  But where is it to be found? Who is going to build it? and how will the people who would build it find and connect with each other?</p>
<p>I think these questions need to be answered before you&#8217;re going to find more followers.</p>

<p>Woah, dude, do you really think I&#8217;m trying to insult you? or derail the conversation?</p>
<p> I only made my observation because I&#8217;d already seen <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMcommunity/comments/1010le/i_strongly_urge_everyone_interested_in_bdsm/" rel="nofollow">a conversation on Reddit</a> where people had implied that their positive experiences were more important that other people&#8217;s negative experiences. I was sure you were already aware that people were likely to do this, but curious as how to combat it.</p>
<p>&#8220;…if you think I’m in this for “more followers,” you don’t understand me at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you are looking for people to follow <i>you</i> per se, but it seems you&#8217;re trying to lead or at (least point the way) to a better community for BDSM, one that I might even feel comfortable in someday.</p>

<p>No, <a href="#comment-452967" rel="nofollow">Peroxide</a>, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re trying to insult me or derail the conversation. That doesn&#8217;t change the fact that what you said hurt for me to read because it feels insulting and, moreover, it <em>is</em> a derail. So I pointed it out. I didn&#8217;t assert anything about your intent, though. Did I? If so, I&#8217;m sorry, that was inappropriate of me to do.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t read the discussion on Reddit that you linked, but I may later. If there is context I&#8217;m missing that you&#8217;re citing from that discussion, please disregard this comment.</p>

<p>I used to be doing that, yes. Then I realized that was stupid because no such community exists or can exist in an institutional form. Now I&#8217;m trying to articulate an alternative structure, but I haven&#8217;t gotten that far yet.

Let&#8217;s see&#8230; I am a middle aged Black heterosexual male. I am a former police officer. I am an EMT who saw service at Ground Zero and at Hurricane Katrina. I am also a Dominant man who has lived the BDSM publicly for close to a decade and doing kinky things for decades before.</p>
<p>I have a unique take on your conversation. I started learning about BDSM at gay dungeons because they were the only ones I could find until I found TES. TES gave me a broad based education in the scene. I learned from Dominant and submissive men and women, forged friendships with people of all gender identifications, various kinks and various schools of thought. </p>
<p>Do I agree with everything I&#8217;ve seen in all of the clubs, groups and organizations I&#8217;ve seen and/or been a part of? No! Have I seen racism? Yes. Classism? Yes. Am I as a Black Dom Het male met with open arms everywhere I go? No. Am I sometimes the only person of color in the room? Yes.</p>
<p>But if I want doors to open, I must open them myself, even if it means kicking it open. Why should I isolate myself from sources of knowledge because some ignorant person thinks I shouldn&#8217;t have it? How can I expect the scene or any organizations that claim it to be more open and inviting if I remain outside it. By that logic Blacks should just have their own land and segregate themselves because there will always be some vestiges of racism among the power elite. No! Change, true change comes from challenging the institutions and the powers that be. If you take your ball and run away there are many good playmates and friends you never get the opportunity to meet.</p>
<p>Be a part of it and change it from within. It is hard. It is tedious. It can be done. Take it from a former civil rights activist. It can be done&#8230; and while you&#8217;re having the time of your life!</p>

<p>Bull. Fucking. Shit, Guy.</p>
<p>You see racism and you see classism. Do you see domism, too?</p>
<p>Your entire comment is just the kind of bullshit &#8220;we are the source of what you&#8217;re after&#8221; that The Scene is so good at and that&#8217;s so dangerous. The Scene is NOT the only place, and it&#8217;s far from the best place, to meet people. The Scene is NOT the place to get a &#8220;broad based&#8221; education about BDSM if you are not gender-conformant (which I know you are because we know each other personally and have for years).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t ever want to hear from you again, Guy. Consider your future comments here instantly trashed.</p>

Oh my ;). Anyway, once more unto the breach dear friends.</p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230;..what is my experience of the BDSM community. Pretty much a mixed bag to be honest. I have to say, where I am at least, the idea that people are shunned because of disability, sexuality, gender, appearance, etc. etc. simply isn&#8217;t the case. If anything the BDSM community is far more accepting than the mainstream.</p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;ve encountered one &#8220;organiser&#8221; who I think is loathsome (maybe too strong a word, but if her rudeness isn&#8217;t part of the autism spectrum, it maybe appropriate!), but most people seem nice enough.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d really take issue with is ideas such as &#8220;(the BDSM scene provides) structural cover for rapists&#8221;. This is just absurd. If there is one thing that is going to you shunned in BDSM circles, it is anything non-consensual. This is echoed anywhere you go in the scene. If you fail to adhere to safe-words you will be considered irresponsible and unwelcome, and rightly so. My sense is that if one allows one dark side out to play in a controlled way, one is actually less likely to engage in non-consensual sexual activity/rape/assault/etc, although finding evidence for or against this might prove difficult.</p>
<p>There are many people who are far from beautiful, and no one who I have met is able-body-ist.Lots of larger people are active in the scene, as well as older people, none of who are &#8220;little more than the butt of jokes&#8221; or whatever the phrase is.</p>
<p>I suppose my experience is limited to the two major university cities in England, so is perhaps not representative of the author&#8217;s experience. I am not saying the BDSM &#8220;scene&#8221; is all that important (I&#8217;m not hugely into it myself) and it&#8217;s certainly not got a monopoly on my exploring anything: I didn&#8217;t meet my current partner through the scene. But insofar as any organisation is going to be prone to organisational imperfections and politics, I don&#8217;t see the BDSM scene as particularly malignant. It can be a bit formulaic at times, and structured, but generally people just get on and do what they want to do and maybe share ideas along the way, and find others to play with.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think a more measured tone is useful here. As far as sexism goes, it&#8217;s not going to take more than a generation or two before males will be less educated, earning less, etc. etc. There is a general trend of emasculation in society, and perhaps dominance for some men might then prove a healthy escape from this oppression! Who knows?</p>

I like the cotnorl aspect of it.  Not just the cotnorl of the sub, but the self-cotnorl of both the dom/domme and the sub.  I don&#8217;t like when the characters don&#8217;t practice safe and consenual sex.  When it gets into abuse then it&#8217;s not a turn on.</p>
