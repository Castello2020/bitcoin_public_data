<ol>
<li>I hate Kink, Inc.<sup><a href="#footnote_0_2447" id="identifier_0_2447" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I beseech you, we must begin to call this company by their name&mdash;NOT the endearing, self-promotional &ldquo;Kink.com&rdquo; but Kink, INCORPORATED, for that is what they are, and we would do well to remind one another of that at every opportunity.">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="#footnote_1_2447" id="identifier_1_2447" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Several people have correctly pointed out to me that &ldquo;Kink, Inc.&rdquo;&lsquo;s business name is actually Cybernet Entertainment, LLC. For the interested, their business entity number is 199821910013, which can be retrieved at the Secretary of State&rsquo;s Business Search page. I use &ldquo;Kink, Inc.&rdquo; as a colloquialism, in case that isn&rsquo;t obvious to you.">2</a></sup> That does not mean I want them eradicated—they have been doing a shitty job of it, but I believe have made the world a (slightly) better place on balance—it means I have incredibly negative feelings for them that are far, far stronger than mere disapproval or dislike or disappointment. As a result, you may feel that the rest of this post is tinged with anger or outright rage. And you would be correct.</li>
<li>The title of this post is intentionally provocative. It equates murder and attempted assassination with what I view as the long-running corrosion of sex-positivity perpetrated by a darling of the supposedly sex-positive porn movement. That may not be fair, an argument for which I&#8217;ll only be ready to entertain after I express my indignation, and only from people who make evident they have read this post. Nevertheless, I do not think it is ill-concieved to take the events from one context and apply them to another in an attempt to better understand one another and the world we inhabit. That is my intent here.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, there were two events this week that made me feel unspeakably angry. In the first, America sat in horror as <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/08/nation/la-naw-gabrielle-giffords-20110109">Democratic congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was shot in the head and 6 others were killed</a> by a gunman in Tucson, Arizona. In the second, people reacted with a <a href="http://lovebites.blogs.chicago.timeout.com/2011/01/11/kink-com-virgin/">mixture of support, indifference</a>, <a href="http://pippingeek.wordpress.com/2011/01/12/virginity-sexuality-and-womens-choice/">unease</a>, <a href="http://afemanistview.blogspot.com/2011/01/kinkcom-earn-fail-over-virginity-fetish.html">disgust</a>, and <a href="http://www.divatology.com/deeper/?p=2272">resignation</a> to a press release by Kink, Inc. advertising the purported &#8220;deflowering&#8221; of a (real, live!) &#8220;virgin.&#8221;</p>
<p>The numerous different reactions (and resulting <a href="http://lovebites.blogs.chicago.timeout.com/2011/01/12/porn-virginity-standards/">questions</a>) to the porn company&#8217;s press release are pretty interesting. I first heard about the press release on Twitter by way of Dr. Petra Boynton, who <a href="https://twitter.com/quietriot_girl/status/24915241628340224">caught some flak</a> (<a href="//maybemaimed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/drpetra-flak-kink-inc-virgin-twitter-convo.png">more of the conversation</a>) for expressing <a href="https://twitter.com/DrPetra/status/24925851124502528">concern about the way &#8220;hymen&#8221; was being represented</a> in the company&#8217;s marketing material. Several others, <a href="https://twitter.com/heathercorinna/status/24912218676002817">notably Heather Corinna</a> of <a href="http://scarleteen.com/">Scarleteen</a>, and <a href="missmaggiemayhem.com">Miss Maggie Mayhem</a> had similar concerns. <a href="http://missmaggiemayhem.com/2011/01/12/virginity/">Quoting Maggie</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://missmaggiemayhem.com/2011/01/12/virginity/"><p>I do not take issue with Ms. Blue’s fantasy and desire to have vaginal sex for the first time on camera. I do not take issue with the fact that it can be incredibly hot and sexy to watch someone have vaginal sex for the first time. I do sincerely hope that it is a rewarding experience for everyone because I am a big cheerleader for all forms of consensual activity whether or not I enjoy them myself. My life has been dedicated to fighting for that very thing.</p>
<p>I do have issues with <a href="http://www.xbiz.com/news/129270">press releases</a> that perpetuate dangerous myths.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maggie goes on to name and debunk several of these myths. However, she also touches on another point that <a href="https://twitter.com/maymaym/status/24942482496159744">I first made on Twitter</a> and which I feel has been largely overlooked by the rush to correct all the anatomical misinformation.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://missmaggiemayhem.com/2011/01/12/virginity/"><p><strong>I find the marketing and publicity around this shoot to be the issue at hand.</strong> […] I am not worried about Nicki Blue. I know that she is in very good and capable hands on set. It’s the rest of us that I’m worried about when the packaging of the shoot includes blatant misinformation.</p>
<p>Kink.Com has the right to say whatever they want about their content. I am experiencing disappointment by their unwillingness to rise to the occasion. A press release is, by its very nature, designed to spark interest and by that standard it was inordinately effective. Buzz words were selected with deliberation and it is true that if you want to sell a product, the press release may not be the best place to do so. However, when I look at the pride flags waving in the wind from the rooftop of the armory I have to wonder if they match the words in those press releases.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis mine.)</p>
<p>Perhaps as a sometimes-model for Kink, Inc., Maggie needs to be tactful, which I can respect. Thankfully, I&#8217;m burdened by no such constraints. I very much agree with her, except mere disappointment is itself a disappointing reaction. Here&#8217;s my series of tweets on the matter, reproduced without others&#8217; usernames:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anatomy issue aside, I view this as yet another of Kink, Inc.&#8217;s sexist sell-outs. :( Kink[ Inc.] have become masterful at promoting sexist BDSM gender essentialist fantasy. Nothing wrong w/fantasy but something VERY WRONG w/not acknowledging the distinction. When majority is unable to make that distinction […] it&#8217;s not implicit. :( Incumbent on Kink[ Inc.] to do so. The product is not the place to make the fantasy/reality distinction. The PRESS RELEASE is the place to responsibly do that. I&#8217;m not concerned about Ms. Blue. I believe she&#8217;s well-treated &amp; informed. I&#8217;m concerned about [the] irresponsible press release.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth pointing out that Kink, Inc. CEO Peter Acworth may ultimately agree, <a href="http://missmaggiemayhem.com/2011/01/12/virginity/#comment-493">saying</a> he &#8220;regret[s] how the press release was worded.&#8221; While possibly genuine, I&#8217;m sure the company is aware of the economic model simplified in the retelling of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash,_Jr.">John Nash</a>&#8216;s story in the movie <cite>A Beautiful Mind</cite>: what&#8217;s economically best for an individual is to do what is best for oneself <em>and</em> the group/community/others in the same sphere. Call me a cynic, bitter, or whatever, but I remain <em>unconvinced</em> Acworth&#8217;s apparent remorse deserves any leniency.</p>
<p>The sex-positive community is typically slow to criticize and quick to dole out praise for their darling Kink, Inc., but absolutely nothing the company does excuses the total self-absolution of their responsibility to promote their product with at least some shred of <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2011/01/03/why-advocating-both-privacy-and-transparency-is-not-hypocritical/">integrity</a>. This is far from the first <ins datetime="2011-01-15T03:47:06+00:00">(<a href="http://adelehaze.com/kink-virginity-and-big-tittied-whores/">see Adele Haze</a>)</ins> and won&#8217;t be the last time they fail to do so. This press release—and I reiterate that I’m only referring to the press release, not the upcoming performance—while perhaps a marketer’s version of a wet dream, had <em>none</em>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. Phrases like &#8220;true virgin,&#8221; &#8220;the winner,&#8221; and &#8220;sacrificing Nikki&#8217;s innocence,&#8221; are (it needs saying again) totally acceptable fantasy. Go ahead, &#8220;winner,&#8221; call Nikki an innocent sacrifice while you&#8217;re fucking her—more power to the both of you. However, <strong>do not pretend it is acceptable for business as usual to include demolishing the line between business communications and fantasy sex</strong>. These phrases have absolutely no place in a <em>press release</em> being circulated to <em>news agencies</em>, and any company run by responsible sex-positive adults should fucking know better.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, several self-identified pro-porn advocates will be breathing down my throat about this. <a href="https://twitter.com/quietriot_girl/status/24944420969259008">How dare I tell a porn company what to do</a>? Should you have the urge to toss this straw-man at me, consider for a moment your own views on things like occupational health and safety regulations, or asbestos regulations for contractors. The issue is not telling a company what it may or may not do, it is about how to create an atmosphere of genuine health for both the company, which is made up of individual human beings, <em>and</em> its consumers.</p>
<p>While I, personally, feel that there shouldn&#8217;t actually be regulations for how porn companies may or may not craft press releases, or use certain words, or anything as inane and utterly, mindlessly, pathetically stupid as that, this does not mean there should be no oversight on the matter.</p>
<p>Porn companies <em>are companies</em>, and they have a product. What makes their product different from, say, a steel mill or a coal mine is that their product is largely <em>cultural</em>, not material. They operate in a completely different arena; they do not have to deal with resource scarcity or distribution in the same way, for example. <strong>But this does not mean they do not pollute. They do. Kink, Inc. is a massive polluter.</strong></p>
<p>What baffles me is that almost all of the simple-minded (read: the anti-porn lunatics) understand this intuitively yet a staggering portion of my peers seem oblivious to it. The simple-minded, in their never-ending idiocy, <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2010/07/29/anti-porn-is-pro-censorship-even-if-they-say-theyre-not/">lobby for government regulation to solve this problem</a>, but that is so obviously the wrong tool for this job. Their&#8217;s is the lazy solution, forcing us to work twice as hard to resolve things. The right tool is the more difficult road: corporate social responsibility.</p>
<p>What do I mean by corporate social responsibility? Well, let&#8217;s look at the Giffords shooting. Pima County Sheriff <a href="http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/pima-sheriff-clarence-dupnik-calls-out-vitr">Clarence Dupnik immediately brought attention to the &#8220;vitriolic rhetoric&#8221;</a> permeating the political climate in this country when he spoke of the tragic events this weekend. Although Sheriff Dupnik named no names, it is far too easy for any one of us to do so. And some unnamed examples aren&#8217;t merely rhetoric, they are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J5VZ_aNf5I">literal calls to arms, and to violence</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of your political views, and setting aside the many entanglements this most-recent domestic American massacre has raised, most people seem to agree that one thing is far beyond dispute: words have consequences. Language matters.</p>
<p>In the wake of the Giffords shooting, scumbags all over the Internet are tripping all over themselves arguing about which rights we should restrict next in a sadly predictable, misguided at best and opportunistic at worst, fascistic attempt to prevent the next American gun massacre from happening. <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/william-galston/81228/the-tucson-shooter-and-the-case-involuntary-commitment">Bring back involuntary commitment</a>! <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/01/12/132839585/a-scramble-to-control-narrative-of-tucson-massacre">Stricter gun control</a>! Even, and this is completely insane, <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/01/dem-congressman-introduce-bill-banning-bullseye-crosshair-symbols/">let&#8217;s pass a law to ban violent rhetoric</a>! (Oy, the stupid. It burns.)</p>
<p>Again, set aside your political views on any of these topics and look, I beg of you, at the <em>paradigm</em> each of these ideas have come from. More laws are not the answer. The answer must come from mindfulness not merely of our own political message but the environment we are in, <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/879252420/a-clothed-man-is-bound-to-a-heavy-chair-with-long">the overarching context</a>. Expediency through intellectual myopia is not an inevitability, nor an optimal long-term strategy.</p>
<p>Back to Kink, Inc.&#8217;s über-fail. <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/08/14/more-men-need-to-cry-on-the-big-porn-screen/">I&#8217;ve long condemned that company for their utterly sexist attitude to porn-selling</a>, if not porn-making (although <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/91994257/a-half-dressed-man-stares-across-a-room-at-a-woman">there&#8217;s some of that</a>, too). But I&#8217;ve been largely alone among my peers in this. That does not highlight Kink, Inc.&#8217;s most recent inevitable failure, it highlights the failure of my fellow sexuality community members.</p>
<p>Kink, Inc. is either not a company run by socially responsible people or it is one filled with people who, pitiably, are so disconnected from the reality of others (like me) that they are truly clueless about the effects of their actions. Worse, if we are to ascribe to them simple stupidity rather than malice, then they are like the global warming deniers who can&#8217;t tell the difference between weather and climate.</p>
<p>Sadly, the rest of the mainstream porn industry (and, yes, Kink, Inc. <em>is</em> part of the mainstream porn industry) is so much worse that Kink, Inc. <em>still</em> rightfully earns the gratitude of many performers, producers, and consumers. I have personally befriended numerous people who work or worked at the company and have only occasionally heard anything save positive things. For that, bravo. However, it should be seen as <em>small</em> praise, not a laudable accomplishment, to be the most perfectly formed piece of shit at the top of <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/91850568/an-unimportant-uninteresting-man-is-hidden-behind">a steaming, stinking pile of the stuff</a>.</p>
<p><a href="//maybemaimed.com/2010/09/28/defend-sex-ed-the-chronicle-calls-for-revocation-of-student-rights-cowardly-ignores-academics-objections/">Our culture is so thoroughly sexually unhealthy</a>, and so totally poisoned by acrimonious greed, that we as a sex-positive community have become used to eating whatever shit-covered scraps of consensual sexual fulfillment we get. So when Kink, Inc. merely feeds us shit-<em>laced</em> scraps, many people swallow it with ease. Those who swallow this crap without a second thought may even disgust me more than the imbecilic anti-porn crusaders, because I&#8217;d like to think those people actually have the mental capacity to demand better, and then they lazily, selfishly don&#8217;t. And with astonishingly self-righteous self-gratification (&#8220;look at how sexual/sex-positive I am!&#8221;), to boot.</p>
<p>People who are shocked (SHOCKED, I say!) that Kink, Inc. would behave in such a way have been asleep for the last 2 years. They remind me of the people who were shocked (SHOCKED, they insist!) to note the violence in Arizona this weekend. I don&#8217;t blame Kink, Inc. They&#8217;re doing what they have always done: they&#8217;re making money. This is simply the latest public example of their (perhaps begrudging) buying in to the kind of self-debasing, <a href="//maymay.net/blog/2010/01/08/what-kind-of-world/">racing-to-the-bottom cancer endemic of our economic system</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, I blame you, writer with a sex blog who hasn&#8217;t demanded better, and loudly. I blame you, friends who purchase Kink, Inc. material knowing full-well what economic company you&#8217;re keeping. And I blame you, sex-positive-turned-sex-negative apologists who are so blinded by anti-porn arguments you have not yet done the difficult, painful work of self-reflection on your own priorities. <strong>You, like me, are part of the chorus of influencers on our own 24-hour news cycle who have, working together, utterly failed to shun this and other <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2009/10/02/dont-you-fret-sexism-is-alive-and-well-in-bdsm/">sexism in BDSM</a> porn within our own metaphorical political party.</strong></p>
<p>Those of you with a sense of loyalty stronger than a sense of principle are complicit in the failure of your own movement. On this occasion, shame suits you. And if Kink, Inc. gets blasted for this in the mainstream, I dare say that, this time, they deserve it.</p>
<p>Let us never forget that most of the <a href="http://kinkontap.com/?p=1275">rhetoric surrounding virginity is inherently sexist</a>. Remember, also, it is <a href="http://blog.iwhc.org/2010/05/10-myths-about-sex-and-virginity-debunked/">far more pervasive</a> than violent political metaphors. Appallingly, it is even the basis on which some men justify <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_killing">murdering their own daughters, sisters or would-be wives</a> upon learning that the woman in question is not, in their mind, &#8220;sexually pure.&#8221; Let me say that again: some women around the world are literally killed for losing their perceived virginity, sometimes <em>because</em> they were raped. And for my own pain, which hardly pales in comparison, I&#8217;ve <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2009/08/18/there-is-no-bdsm-mecca/">written</a> at <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2011/01/09/censorship-is-cultural-terrorism-and-other-things-i-think-about-predilectionaz-com-interview/">some</a> length <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2010/12/02/the-bdsm-community-ghetto-and-other-cultural-problems/">how unabashed sexism negatively affects sexually submissive men</a>, and I will be continuing to do so for as long as I have the will.</p>
<p>So, tell me, why does spreading misinformation about virginity, or tearing down the <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/08/01/your-fantasy-is-not-reality-and-you-should-know-better/">distinctions between fantasy and reality</a> not amount to sexually violent speech? Why are those creepy men who open conversations with &#8220;May I rub your feet, Mistress&#8221; not viewed as our community&#8217;s equivalent of Jared Lee Loughners? And from that perspective, how can Kink, Inc.&#8217;s press release be viewed as any different than <a href="http://www.uncommonphotographers.net/archives/6247">Sarah Palin&#8217;s gunsight poster</a>?</p>
<p>And, most importantly, what are <em>you</em> going to do to help make sure it never happens again?</p>

<p>He loves to make spurious links between pornography and war.</p>
<p>I accept I was rash in saying &#8216;I wouldn&#8217;t tell a porn co. what to do&#8217;. I think some kind of regulation of the industry and encouraging ethical processes is important. But being too prescriptive and simplistic, as you say, doesn&#8217;t help.</p>
<p>I still think that some people drawing attention to that press release were doing so in  a way that was &#8216;anti-kink&#8217; and made me feel our sexualities were being done a disservice. </p>
<p>As for Palin and Kink.com I am sorry but I do not see a link. At all.</p>

<p>Sometimes those who are hurt can see a problem others say does not exist. You and I should sit down over coffee one day when I am in England, <a href="#comment-100649" rel="nofollow">Quiet Riot Girl</a>, and you will have an opportunity to hear my voice and see my tears.</p>
<p>I also find it remarkable that <a href="https://twitter.com/quietriot_girl/status/24932388677099520" rel="nofollow">you badger people on Twitter to listen to the kink crowd</a>, and when <a href="https://twitter.com/maymaym/status/24939710119944193" rel="nofollow">someone from the kink crowd says something you disagree with</a>, you <a href="https://twitter.com/quietriot_girl/status/24941508520050688" rel="nofollow">dismiss their viewpoint</a>.

Words and presentation <i>do</i> matter, and I think in particular with regards to the porn industry it&#8217;s easy for sex-positive advocates to get wrapped up in defending &#8220;our own.&#8221;  (I don&#8217;t consider Kink Inc one of &#8220;my&#8221; own for much the same reasons that you despise them so.)  Thank you for pointing out the difference between defending the right to make whatever porn the actors are willing and happy to participate in, and defending the reprehensible, sexist way the product is being marketed.  </p>
<p>To others (who probably won&#8217;t read this comment, but what the hell, just in case) who take issue with the comparison &#8211; Maymay&#8217;s not equating Kink Inc&#8217;s latest behavior with the shooting.  That would, in fact, be inappropriate and insulting.  The rhetoric that is being so fiercely called out for its violence on the national stage is the point of comparison, and an apt one.  </p>
<p>And finally &#8211; Maymay, thank you for your consistent and strong stance against sexism in all the places (everywhere!) it shows up.  I know you have a large stake in things getting better on that front, and that you know it, but it doesn&#8217;t make me any less grateful.  Most men with whom I&#8217;m acquainted are better than average at avoiding sexist attitudes themselves, but almost across the board they turn a blind eye to the endemic expressions of it in culture (and start the eyerolling when I get upset about it).  Your blog is one of the few places where I know there&#8217;s an ally with open eyes.</p>

How dare I tell a porn company what to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ve never had a problem &#8220;telling a porn company what to do&#8221; when it comes to occupational safety or workplace conditions, and I&#8217;ve long said this. (My issues with the current controversy around this in California come from the systematic exclusion of working performers from the process of crafting workable regulations, all the while putting somebody like Shelly Lubben front and center.)</p>
<p>Obviously, I have a bigger problem with telling <i>anybody</i> what to do when it comes to matters of pure expression, which is what I see at stake here. Also obviously, I consider anything that&#8217;s expressed as open to praise, critique, or simply being ignored. But as I point out to anti-porn folks when they&#8217;re in their &#8220;we&#8217;re not censoring, we&#8217;re protesting&#8221; mode, just because somebody has a particular criticism does not mean I&#8217;m under any obligation to be in agreement with it. (Not to compare you in the least with anti-porn types, Maymay, and I think the comparison to Robert Jensen was uncalled for.)</p>
<p>Has Kink.com put something out there that&#8217;s particularly cringeworthy and open to general rebuke? So far, you haven&#8217;t convinced me of that. I really don&#8217;t see the slippery slope between the virginity fetish Kink is clearly playing on, and a more generalized concept of enforced virginity in young women (which I agree, is problematic, to put it mildly). That, and the fact that I tend not to get overly-worried about the possibility of imitative behavior, was what was behind my tweet about not worrying whether &#8220;porn gives the normals bad ideas&#8221;.</p>
<p>Finally, a lot of what you write here seems to be intermixed with your long-standing criticism of the hegemony of a particular mode of male submission in BDSM circles, and I find the tie-in to this recent issue to be pretty thin. Not saying I don&#8217;t find that critique valid, I just fail to see how it applies here.</p>

<p>Well, <a href="#comment-100790" rel="nofollow">Iamcuriousblue</a>, I find <em>most</em> of what they put out there &#8220;particularly cringeworthy…&#8221; (see the posts discussing my writings on sexism negatively affecting sexually submissive men, linked in this post)</p>
<blockquote cite="#comment-100790"><p>…and open to general rebuke?</p></blockquote>
<p>…but there&#8217;s little about me that would align me with anyone&#8217;s idea of &#8220;general.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s kind of the point I&#8217;m making here, by the way: that the entire &#8220;Greek chorus,&#8221; as <a href="http://missmaggiemayhem.com/2011/01/12/virginity/#comment-500" rel="nofollow">this shit-eating commenter on Maggie&#8217;s blog</a> calls people criticizing Kink, Inc. about this press release (if you&#8217;ll pardon the angry phraseology), is disingenuous precisely because they don&#8217;t criticize Kink, Inc.&#8217;s similar behavior when their virginity-fetish-squick buttons are not pressed.</p>
<blockquote cite="#comment-100790"><p> I really don’t see the slippery slope between the virginity fetish Kink is clearly playing on, and a more generalized concept of enforced virginity in young women (which I agree, is problematic, to put it mildly).</p></blockquote>
<p>Nor do I, because there <em>isn&#8217;t</em> one. It <em>isn&#8217;t</em> a slippery slope between one form of porn and another, or one press release or another. It is the entire modus operandi and orientation of the company that I have been calling out as wretched for years. Yes, less wretched than the likes of many others in the industry, but still wretched.</p>
<p>And here, again, I am one of only a few levying such harsh criticism. And to top it all off, I acknowledge this is all extremely inside baseball. But to be so promptly and self-righteously joined by so many others decrying their behavior <em>this time</em> is nonsense, and shames my fellow bloggers far more than it shames Kink, Inc.</p>
<blockquote cite="#comment-10079"><p>Finally, a lot of what you write here seems to be intermixed with your long-standing criticism of the hegemony of a particular mode of male submission in BDSM circles, and I find the tie-in to this recent issue to be pretty thin.

<p>I think you misunderstood what I was criticizing when you wrote your comment, which is unfortunate and possibly my failure. I&#8217;d be interested to know if you still think the tie-in is weak after noting my reply to your &#8220;slippery slope&#8221; comment, above.</p>

I am sorry for the Jensen reference. That was stupid.</p>
<p>P.P.s. I think Maymaym and I may have a difference of opinion around the sex educators e.g Petra Boynton who shared the info and who framed kink.inc&#8217;s virginity event as &#8216;disturbing&#8217; and &#8216;worrying&#8217; and who only spoke about it in relation to misinformation about virginity and sexist treatment of women. This is part of wider discourse in sex education that often presents kink porn and practice as perverted and &#8216;dangerous&#8217;. And in the UK when prosecutions are happening under the extreme porn act at the moment this bothers me particularly.</p>
<p>I dont know much about kink.inc&#8217;s working practices etc I have merely enjoyed some of their products as a consumer. I don&#8217;t tend to assume porn companies are great, whoever they are. They are definitely no &#8216;darling&#8217; of mine.</p>
<p>The link to the crosshairs and the rhetoric I think is still dodgy. But then I am also defending Palin against the hate and blame she is receiving from the liberal media and so maybe I am just coming at this from a different perspective.</p>

<p>(Unlike MySpace, YouTube actually has kept his page live.)</p>

points at my place as you&#8217;re making here, and as Miss Maggie Mayhem<br />
made in her comments about the debate. Inasmuch as (as your OP<br />
notes) the press release and other materials in the build-up to<br />
this are presenting it not as &#8220;fantasy&#8221; but a live broadcast of<br />
something &#8220;real&#8221;, I think that was part of what informed my<br />
reaction to the whole thing. Is it fair to say that you also<br />
express disgust at Kink[Inc] in general? I haven&#8217;t seen anyone<br />
&#8220;trying to tell porn co&#8217;s what to do&#8221;, but in the spirit of free<br />
speech I think a lot of people are saying that Kink[Inc] can say/do<br />
what they like, but we can say equally loudly that we think it&#8217;s<br />
not a very positive thing for them to be saying.</p>

Any different treatment of one of the sexes, is assumed to be sexist. This is furthermore assumed to be a bad thing.</p>
<p>However, men and women are fundamentally, and biologically different. ( <a href="http://www.tgdaily.com/general-sciences-features/52293-new-study-males-might-be-more-%E2%80%9Cdisposable%E2%80%9D-than-females" rel="nofollow">http://www.tgdaily.com/general-sciences-features/52293-new-study-males-might-be-more-%E2%80%9Cdisposable%E2%80%9D-than-females</a> ).</p>
<p>Now as the nature of our species appears to be one where women have the role of the choosers, society is _naturally_ sexist. For not being &#8216;sexist&#8217; would be denying reality.</p>
<p>Only a fool would therefore argue that this kind of &#8216;sexism&#8217; is a bad thing.</p>
<p>Statistics back the whole whore/stud dichotomy up, as even with modern contraceptive measures women who sleep around pose a greater risk of transmitting a STD to their partners than men who sleep around.</p>
<p>With modern marriage laws being inherently unfavorable for men, and men responsible for paying for a woman&#8217;s choice (child support, we can&#8217;t choose to abort her baby or have the baby, can we?), it is important to choose a woman who will at least be faithful. The chance of a woman being faithful diminishes over the amount of partners she has, after all, how can her 30th man be more special than her 29 previous partners?</p>

<p>Ah, I think we have different connotations for &#8220;disgust&#8221;, because to me, disgust is a very powerful reaction to something and to me &#8220;that&#8217;s icky&#8221; is more &#8220;that seems unpleasant to me&#8221; than &#8220;aurgh! get it away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, that was &#8220;can&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;have permission to&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8217;s legitimate to&#8221; rather than in the sense of &#8220;are able to&#8221;.   But yes, it&#8217;s a good point to remember about media amplification.</p>

What I&#8217;ve seen in the previews never looked particularly interesting to me and I never really checked them out. I only learned about this debate through Pandora Blake&#8217;s blog, who linked to your post here among others. So I come to this discussion as something of an outsider.</p>
<p>I would like to say something about your analogy with the Giffords shooting, however.</p>
<p>To begin with, I think it is too early to tell whether the vitriolic rhetoric in American political debate really had an influence on the shooter. Until we know more about his background and more about how, exactly, he came to the stage in his life where he committed these crimes, that is mostly speculation.</p>
<p>That as it may be, however, I agree that the language in American political debate has gotten completely out of hand in the recent decade and that &#8220;verbal disarmament&#8221; is direly needed on all sides. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think it is going to happen. The soul-searching which Sheriff Dupnik called for lasted for all of about ten seconds until the usual suspects started to tear each other apart again in their political articles and blogs. Which says a lot about the state of the country today.</p>
<p>(I say this, again, as something of an outsider &#8211; a German who keeps an eye on political debate in the US, and elsewhere, and is reasonably well-informed by reading blogs and hearing from friends.)</p>
<p>Now, let us say for the sake of the argument that vitriolic political rhetoric did have an influence on the shooter. Then the one thing that could be learned from it, and perhaps from plain common sense as well, is that hyperbolic language and exaggerated comparisons (&#8220;Obama = Hitler&#8221; etc.) do not help anyone. Even when they do not incite actual violence, they are certainly not conducive to a rational, sensible debate.</p>
<p>I find the comparison with the Giffords shooting to be exaggerated, and entirely unhelpful to the debate about Kink, Inc. Yes, I understand where you are going with it. Yes, language has consequences. But there are other ways to say this. To use this particular analogy, at this particular time, less than a week after it happened and before we know any real details about the background&#8230; Well, I just think it is poorly chosen, and it constitutes in effect, if not in intention, an instrumentalisation of tragedy to promote personal viewpoints that leaves a bad taste.</p>
<p>I understand that you wanted to be &#8220;intentionally provocative&#8221;, but was that really necessary in a debate about Kink, Inc. that seemed to be fairly emotionally charged already? I think your choice of analogy does more to cheapen your point than it does to drive it home. And while we are re-examining the consequences of language, was it really necessary to heap all those metaphors about pollution, poisoning and cancer into the discussion?</p>
<p>Obviously, you care very deeply and honestly about the issue. You admit yourself that the post is tinged with &#8220;outright rage&#8221;. I appreciate that, and there are plenty of issues about which I feel outright rage myself. But rage isn&#8217;t always a good accomplice in writing. The irony is that, while you are pointing out, correctly, how presentation matters, your own presentation was the weakest part of the post. You raised some thought-provoking points, but I think they would probably have been much better made with a different framing, and if you had written the post in a less outraged mood.</p>

<p>Well, <a href="#comment-101309" rel="nofollow">Ludwig</a>, hopefully a better person than I can take those thought-provoking points and run with them without the emotional outrage evident in this post. Clearly, I was unable to do so.</p>
<p>While you <em>may</em> be correct that I would have had greater effect, and more grace, without the anger, I honestly did the best I could. I appreciate that you offered me some credit for acknowledging my limitations. It&#8217;d be nice if you could offer me some credit for acknowledging my limitations <em>and</em> going ahead with the publish button, anyway.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, it&#8217;s interesting to hear the viewpoint of a German national. Thanks for your comment! :)</p>

<p>I think we can both agree, though, that once the table-pounding and venting of anger is over (which is a healthy thing, certainly better than keeping that anger bottled up inside!), a less confrontational mode of discussion is usually more productive.</p>
<p>That said, the whole &#8220;Hymen-gate&#8221; affair is certainly an interesting discussion, for various reasons, and I&#8217;ll comment more here once I have thought about some things in depth. I&#8217;m also glad I found this well-written blog, which had eluded my attention until today.</p>

I think that for the most part they&#8217;re on the right side.</p>
<p>However, all the work is completely undercut by the tone-deaf marketing. The ads, banners, and taglines for every site are utterly sensationalistic, predicated on their ability to drive traffic.That&#8217;s all that matters to the marketing people, so they&#8217;ll play on fantasies and traditional schemes to get eyeballs and clicks. Though it&#8217;s part of their business, I think it&#8217;s ultimately self-negating. Their PR and corporate identity are fundamentally at odds with the way the product is currently marketed, and a house divided cannot stand.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s a topic for next year&#8217;s Arse Elektronika, which after all is looking to bring class and economics back to the sex tech discourse.</p>

Please excuse me if I copy and paste a lot of it from what I wrote at Maggie Mayhem&#8217;s, but as you and she bring up many of the same points, it makes sense.</p>
<p>I am not concerned with real or pereived failings of Kink.com in the past &#8211; as I said, I don&#8217;t know much about them as a producer. I am concerned only with the recent &#8220;Hymen-gate&#8221; affair around Nicki Blue.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are several viable definitions of virginity. You could define it as the first time when someone has penis-in-vagina sex, or perhaps as the first time of “intense” sexual contact of any kind (including anal or oral sex, or perhaps BDSM play), or you could define it as something totally mental, like the first time you really felt “with” someone during sex. I think that, in a sexually liberated and pluralistic society, which definition of virginity you subscribe to and which one you apply to your own experiences should be strictly a matter of personal choice.</p>
<p>Now, it seems that Nicki Blue subscribes to the penis-in-vagina definition of virginity and that the Kink.com press release drew from her own words. We should respect that. It’s her body and her “virginity”. How she views it is up to her. We have no right to impose our definition of virginity on her just as she would not have a right to impose hers on us.</p>
<p>The criticism of Kink.com’s press release, of course, stems from how it supposedly implies that penis-in-vagina virginity is the only viable definition of virginity. Does it really do that, though? I don’t think it does. You could interpret it that way if you take “true virgin” to mean “virgin in the only true sense of the word”. However, I simply read it as “true virgin according to the definition we are concerned with here in our scenario”.</p>
<p>I mean, given that the whole point of the scenario is Nicki Blue’s first vaginal sex, it is obvious why they would frame “true virgin” like this and why they would make such a fuss about the hymen, with the “hymen cam” and all that. It’s showbusiness. Personally, I view it as silly rather than offensive. I do not view it as a statement, directed towards all women, claiming that penis-in-vagina virginity is the only true form of virginity or that a woman is only a “true virgin” if her hymen is intact.</p>
<p>Of course, you can disagree with me and claim that these (obviously false) beliefs are implied by the wording of the press release. However, the problem I see with that is as follows: if we make the acceptability of porn dependent on subjective interpretations like that, on its alleged “implications”, we open a can of worms that will make life very difficult for us kinksters. Could it not be claimed that BDSM videos depicting corporal punishment imply that corporal punishment is an acceptable form of correction in schools or prisons, that violence is an acceptable method of solving personal conflicts, that (if we are watching an M/F video) men are supposed to rule over women? That, therefore, such videos should not be made because they send out culturally harmful messages? I don’t agree with this interpretation of BDSM videos at all, but logically speaking, it is no less viable than the interpretation that the Kink.com press release implies that penis-in-vagina virginity is the only form of virginity.</p>
<p>It has been pointed out that a press release is a different medium than the porn videos themselves, that it is an “out of character” document and should therefore not use the same kind of language that one might use within the context of the sexual fantasy. I’m not sure I agree with this line of criticism, either. Are producers forbidden from using the language of sexual fantasy in a press release that advertises a porn video? Also, in this case, the whole point of the video is that it is based in reality in the sense that Nicki Blue, the performer, has never had vaginal sex before. So you can’t fully separate the sexual fantasy aspect from the reality of the performers.</p>
<p>For me, whether porn is ethical or not depends entirely on the circumstances of the production of the content. Did all the performers give their full and informed consent? Was attention being paid to protecting their health and safety? Was the payment fair? And so on. It does not depend on the interpretation of the content by the viewers, on what “cultural implications” they see there.</p>
<p>The biggest problem I have with the discussion is the claim that has been made by some, including you, that the press release is “dangerous” and that it could endanger lives. There really is no quantifiable evidence for that. Sure, you can make a theoretical connection between the Kink.com press release and so-called “honour killings”. Just as you can make a theoretical connection between so-called “violent porn” and the rape and murder of women, as anti-porn activists do. But it has never been demonstrated that porn encourages violent actions. And if we take the position that it does, on the basis of mere assumption, then again, we open a can of worms that will come to bite us kinksters very badly.</p>
<p>The sad truth is that, while “honour killings” can be about the matter of vaginal virginity, many are not. In repressive societies, girls have been killed over merely talking to boys, befriending boys, wearing clothes their family didn’t like or listening to music their family didn’t like. It could be almost anything. So I view Kink.com’s press release as rather insignificant in the scheme of things when that subject is concerned.</p>

While I accept I may not have been crystal clear in this writing, little could be further from my intent.</p>
<p>In my view, it is exactly this inability to recognize the nuance of a third position that has so thoroughly tainted the integrity and cannibalized the efficacy of sex-positive arguments on these issues.</p>
<p>So despite mulling over your comment for some days now, I am at a loss as to how to respond in a way that will actually cut to the core of my complaint without leaving me vulnerable to the kind of misdirection explicit in your response. Therefore, I&#8217;m afraid I have no response to your thoughtful and decidedly irrelevant arguments at this time. Perhaps I&#8217;ll write a different post and we can debate cultural notions of virginity. This post, however, was never intended to do that, and simply used the controversy centered around virginity as the vehicle with which to critique the myopia of the arguments many like you have showcased so well.</p>
<p>All that being said, I thank you again for your thoughts!</p>
