			<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><p>When I look back on the past two years of my life, I&#8217;m taken aback at the incredible amount of change. I&#8217;ve written about much of this change, from <a href="//maymay.net/blog/2010/01/08/what-kind-of-world/">my shifting professional aspirations</a>, to <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2010/01/11/the-internet-made-me-a-sexual-freedom-activist-in-2009-now-its-your-turn/">my blossoming activism</a>, to <a href="//maymay.net/blog/2009/04/30/what-kind-of-man/">my personal struggles</a>. But one thing I almost totally stopped writing about <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2009/02/27/8-things-submissive-men-want-from-a-dominant-partner/">ever since Eileen and I broke up</a> was my sex life.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that I was <em>already</em> &#8220;the sex blogger that didn&#8217;t blog about sex,&#8221; at least relatively infrequently and tamely. Nevertheless, I&#8217;m even more widely read now (after stopping to talk about the practice of sex) than I ever was before. More interesting, however, is that I&#8217;m still asked questions about my personal sexual practices, and <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2010/01/31/on-talking-to-children-and-adolescents-about-bdsm-and-sex/">asked questions about sex in general</a>, regardless of how much I do or do not talk about <a href="//maybemaimed.com/label/fantasy/">what I like to do in the sack</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, I got one such question in an email from someone calling themselves Charybdis:</p>
<blockquote><p>I like pain, bondage and most of the BDSM culture, but one problem I keep bumping into is that I cannot find a partner who accepts that I do not need, or really want, penetrative vaginal sex. I find a far more intense pleasure moment in other areas of sexual play. </p>
<p>I know what I like and want. But I keep bumping into that wall within the culture that I am supposed to really enjoy his dick inside of me. Will I ever find anyone who understands? Is it alright to be me, as I am, and still be the dominant personality I am, yet not want to be fucked in my vagina? </p>
<p>I have read some (ok, a lot) of your posts, and you seem to really GET how to explain things. I just haven&#8217;t read anything where you spoke to this.</p>
<p>—<cite>Charybdis</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Both the tone and the content of Charybdis&#8217;s email resonated with me. It&#8217;s frustrating at best and downright depressing at worst to <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2009/08/18/there-is-no-bdsm-mecca/">continually feel barred from a full and happy expression of my sexuality</a> thanks to <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/08/21/i-want-to-be-a-pretty-boy/">other people&#8217;s failure to acknowledge my desires</a>. When Charybdis says they &#8220;keep bumping into that wall within the culture,&#8221; what I hear is, &#8220;<a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/136225950/a-young-man-is-shackled-and-leashed-to-spreader">I&#8217;m frustrated by the systemic suppression of the validity of my sexual desires</a> simply because <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/175406586/a-handcuffed-and-blindfolded-man-lays-on-a-bed-as">they do not conform to cultural norms</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth calling out the fact that the &#8220;culture&#8221; being spoken of is, itself, a subculture (<a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/08/28/the-kink-culture-of-fear/">the BDSM subculture, specifically</a>), and yet even here, far from the mainstream, there&#8217;s <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2009/10/02/dont-you-fret-sexism-is-alive-and-well-in-bdsm/">cultural pressure to conform to some idealized standard of behavior</a> and desire. Regardless of whether such conformity is required by the mainstream or a subculture, the <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/494491786/a-couple-embraces-in-front-of-st-patricks">root of the problem is the same: unquestioned values coupled with disrespect of diversity</a>. While I see nothing inherently wrong with <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/92201638/a-naked-man-is-tied-to-a-large-wooden-plank-by">communally-defined idealized standards</a>, I see a lot of things wrong with <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/434330030/the-penis-of-a-lean-man-is-leashed-loosely-with">the ways those standards are perpetuated</a>, ways that needlessly harm people like Charybdis and myself.</p>
<p>So, first, Charybdis, know this: Yes, it is alright to be you, as you are, and still be the dominant personality you are, yet not want to be fucked in your vagina. Second, know that <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/11/26/while-fucking-i-prefer-to-get-fucked/">you can fuck with your vagina as easily as you can be fucked in it</a>. And finally, know that while you may not have found people who understand this or who don&#8217;t value intercourse highly yet, such people are out there, and <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/11/15/the-closet-and-the-importance-of-others/">they are probably looking for you, too</a>.</p>
<p>Intercourse, which is the word I use to distinguish penis-in-vagina sex from <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2010/02/02/published-strap-on-sex-essay-financial-support-not-financial-compensation/">the many other and equally enjoyable kinds of sex I have</a> with partners, is one of the things that&#8217;s changed a lot for me over the past two years. Eileen and I did have intercourse, but extremely infrequently by anyone&#8217;s measure—maybe once every few months or so? Anyway, it was certainly rare enough that <a href="http://bloodylaughter.com/2008/07/29/sex-and-nachos/">it was especially noteworthy when we did have intercourse</a>. By contrast, intercourse is the sex that <a href="http://followsthesun.com/">Emma</a> and I have most often—intercourse is at least part of almost all of our sexual encounters.</p>
<p>Although I haven&#8217;t <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/116275731/a-naked-couple-is-having-sexual-intercourse-in-the">written much about intercourse specifically</a>, which speaks more to how unimportant the fact of the act is than my interest or lack thereof in it, <a href="http://bloodylaughter.com/2007/07/02/cracking-it-up-to-be/">Eileen has</a>, and I&#8217;d encourage you to <a href="http://bloodylaughter.com/label/sex/">read through her archives on the subject of sex</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://bloodylaughter.com/2007/07/02/cracking-it-up-to-be/"><p>ladies and gentlemen, I am a supposedly “sexually liberated” woman who does not enjoy the act of sexual intercourse. […] I’ve been there, in many different ways with a moderate handful of partners. And I’m here to tell you, it just doesn’t do it for me.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>I would rather curl up in bed with my Hitachi Magic Wand than my achingly eager boyfriend. I’d say it’s a very good thing I ended up with a boy with a fetish for pleasure control.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t doubt that it&#8217;s <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/02/22/ramblings-of-a-boy-with-a-fetish-for-orgasm-control/">my &#8220;fetish for pleasure control&#8221;</a> that shaped my rather existential values regarding sexual acts; the act of <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/03/01/is-there-such-a-thing-as-regular-sex/">intercourse isn&#8217;t hot for me without a certain intentionality</a> and since <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/08/10/the-first-blowjob-ive-ever-bottomed-to/">that intention can be achieved regardless of a specific sex act</a>, I have no worldly reason to find having my cock inside a partner&#8217;s cunt particularly important. Sure, it feels wonderful, but so do many other things. <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/11/02/the-unexpected-clarity/">I kink much harder on being sexually controlled in novel and psychologically intimate ways</a> than I do on simple intercourse.</p>
<p>Indeed, the only strong motivation I can remember feeling for intercourse is derived from my partner&#8217;s desire for the act itself. Enjoying particular sex acts <em>for the acts themselves</em> very often boils down to sexual compersion, for me. Such is undoubtedly the case with Emma.</p>
<p>When Emma and I have intercourse, we do so because she wants that, specifically. So clear is the distinction between her desire for the act and my desire to pleasure her through the act that intercourse, for us, often revolves around an explicit and intentional challenge in which my sole purpose is to pleasure her with my cock (often to the exclusion of my own orgasm, because then the power differential is even more pronounced). During <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/224723924/a-shirtless-man-kneeling-on-a-bed-holds-a-hanger">these scenes, which rarely involve restraints or any other traditional symbols of the BDSM subculture</a>, I&#8217;m not a man wanting sex but rather a mindful and sophisticated pleasure toy that&#8217;s been &#8220;turned on&#8221; for her use.</p>
<p>While the sex I had with Eileen is stunningly different from the sex I have with Emma, my intentionality has not changed. I was Eileen&#8217;s toy. Then (and, happily, now) <a href="http://followsthesun.com/?p=418">I was Emma&#8217;s</a>. Eileen had her personal motivations. Emma has her own, different set.</p>
<p>When sex is amazing, it is never because of a sublimation of desires on anyone&#8217;s part, but rather an alignment of individual self-interest and fulfillment. For many men, intercourse has specific meaning, value, and importance. For me, it doesn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m no more or less a man than the men who desire intercourse, and neither Eileen, Emma, nor Charybdis is any more or less (presumably) women than other women with different desires than theirs.</p>

I find that, even when my libido is at its peak, it&#8217;s not vaginal intercourse I want.  And I similarly derive a significant portion of my enjoyment on my partner&#8217;s satisfaction.</p>
<p>Thanks for writing this, maymay.  I always get puzzled looks from those I explain my interests to when I emphasize that I&#8217;m not looking for sex, or specifically, intercourse sex (because after all, rope, pressure points, and service can be just as sexual an act as any genital stimulation).  The question I inevitably hear is, &#8220;But isn&#8217;t sex the reason to do all of this?  Isn&#8217;t that the end goal?&#8221;</p>
<p>It can be, of course, and it is for many people.  But it doesn&#8217;t, and shouldn&#8217;t, have to be.</p>

This article in particular has given me so much to think about as a weirdo bisexual.  Having a desire for women but lack of interest in intercourse is something people are so quick to pathologize. Being seen as broken is really frustrating.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also weird how on the gay side wherein anal sex becomes the mirror of intercourse in homosexual couplings, if you don&#8217;t want to fuck somebody with your dick then it&#8217;s assumed that you&#8217;re a bottom looking for a top, or oral/jo only. It&#8217;s also assumed that using a strap on or dildo as a penetrating toy is just a precursor or &#8220;warm up&#8221; for the real thing, because, they say, why would you want to only fuck somebody with a strap on if you&#8217;ve got a dick? that question frustrates me to no end. </p>
<p>was thinking about this all yesterday, so good timing for the post. :P</p>

When I&#8217;m not a wild sensual person, I&#8217;m a bit of a motherly type, and I&#8217;ve been worried about you since your Valentine&#8217;s post&#8230;how super to know about Emma!

While a lot of non-lesbians might think we always have sex with strap-ons or something, I have yet to meet a lesbian who doesn&#8217;t understand when I say that no, I&#8217;m not really into intercourse (in our case, dildo-vaginal) most of the time.  The lack of actual penes in the equation probably helps.</p>
<p>Charybdis, I wish you much luck finding someone who understands.</p>

<p>I still meet people who find it weird that I *like* penis in vagina sex, despite the fact that 90% of the time I don&#8217;t have an orgasm from PIV sex alone. (It usually take a strategically placed vibrator, and even then, it generally tends to work best when both literally, and in my head, I have decided to use Anon as my toy).  And Anon and I both find that our orgasms are more intense when one of us is holding/helping the other masturbate.</p>

<p>Yeah, I can see that…. Taking the penis out of the equation biologically does change a lot of people&#8217;s conceptions about sex, even though, frankly, I don&#8217;t see why it <em>should</em>, only that it <em>does</em>.</p>

<p>Indeed, <a href="#comment-37310" rel="nofollow">Wendy</a>. Alternative does not diverse make. Nor does alternative accepting, tolerant, or fair make. We would do well to always remember that.</p>

I&#8217;m a woman and I had a relationship with a man for over a year where we only had intercourse a few times. And we had LOTS of sex. In our case it was due to an STI, but I found I didn&#8217;t miss the intercourse that much. I enjoy the psychological dynamic of a rough session of intercourse, but only with the right person and I really don&#8217;t get the craving that often. It feels good but it doesn&#8217;t give me orgasms. And I&#8217;m sure I could use it as a tool when I&#8217;m being dominant, but I haven&#8217;t had a case when I wanted to yet. I&#8217;d probably be controlling the situation, and giving it as a &#8220;reward&#8221; rather than mostly for my pleasure.</p>

I think the fact that she knows she can have an orgasm in any way that works for her has made it much easier for her to enjoy sex.  </p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t spoken to many guys who get this, and I think you&#8217;ve explained why rather eloquently.  As someone from the far other side of the generation gap, I was talking with a room-full of 60+ year old guys, many of whom have health-related sexual challenges.  They were bemoaning the difficulties, and I said, &#8220;You know, there&#8217;s a whole lot more to sex than what some of us call PIV.&#8221;  Dead silence.  I was hoping it might be a moment to open up a conversation about other kinds of sexuality, but that went no where.  I think I need your silver tongue (oops &#8211; another bad choice of words?) and silver fingers to type as eloquently.</p>
<p>Thanks<br />
Jamie</p>

I&#8217;m dropping in here to rec a film called &#8220;Better than Chocolate.&#8221; It&#8217;s a Canadian film from 1999 with Christina Cox as Kim, a beautiful dyke who wanders into the life of Maggie, good girl turned wild child.</p>
<p>Anyway it&#8217;s funny and sweet and a bit silly, but there&#8217;s wonderful chemistry between Maggie and Kim and a gorgeous sex scene involving body paint. The body paint scene is hot! Two beautiful women having a wonderful, wonderful time. :)</p>

M/f couples i know have been much more about the PIV sex than F/m couples i&#8217;ve known.  no idea what that might play out as in M/m or F/f or and sort of genderfluid/trans pairings.</p>

But like I talked with a friend some time ago, who happens to be a feminine sort of fellow, it&#8217;s so hard to know what you want when the pressure around you is so overwhelming. We both disclosed that we don&#8217;t feel entirely &#8220;cis&#8221;, and are sometimes hurt by the presuppositions posed by others just because of our gender or sex. We are both in seemingly hetero sexual and so normative relationships. I don&#8217;t know what goes on behind those closed doors, but I do know what happens behind mine. Despite that, despite what is important to me and who I am, people have the right to presume what they like and act on it. It&#8217;s really difficult to fall outside a category &#8211; but if you fall outside almost all of them? I presume that is the way the categories are built. That I am as a matter of fact not so different and special. </p>
<p>I am not hetero but I am partnered with a hetero man. I am drawn to women, men, trans and all varieties of self creation I can not even recognize except for my sexuality which sees and hears all. And I have to say &#8211; it sometimes kills me to not have the P in the PIV. It is like edged in my nervous system that I&#8217;m drawn to all that fall out of the normative, the fluid or challenged or adamant but in the &#8220;wrong&#8221; role. I sometimes label myself as hyper-sexual because that is how I handle the world. (And I guess I call it that way because I don&#8217;t see overt sexual behavior as anything masculine, just as is.) But what people think, when they hear it, is that I make crude distinctions between people based on some sort of code, perhaps the gender code. No, no, no. I&#8217;m drawn to everything. I want to get inside everything. I orgasm through a lot of things, but I want to be inside or someone to be inside of me, if I can choose. I need it to feel whole. (Ps. You don&#8217;t need the P for that, either, but I fantasize about having one and using it, anyway.)</p>
<p>I might even be obsessed with PIV even if everything else would fulfill me just as well. I blame (the patriarchy!) the society for that one. Our culture is so obsessed with intercourse that even liberational sex ed is only about birth control and STD&#8217;s like that&#8217;s all there is. It took me a looong time to understand what&#8217;s so fun about PIV anyway, so now that I have found the joys, maybe I&#8217;m just spending my honeymoon with it. ;) (I wrote a bit about the subject in my blog post (Stereotypes) Die Hard how being dominantly lesbian until I was all grown up was my answer to this problem.)</p>
<p>So, even if it is frightening for me to think about someone not wanting PIV at all or being in a relationship where it is, as you put it yourself Maymay, <i>extremely infrequent by anyone’s measure</i>, I can understand wanting things that have nothing to do with the role you&#8217;ve been assigned in the society, or the body parts you have through birth. I guess, we&#8217;re at opposite ends of the scale in this. I&#8217;m happy to learn about the other end. Maybe I&#8217;ll learn something about myself.</p>
