			<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><blockquote><p>“Love is what we were born with. Fear is what we learned here.&#8221; —<cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Williamson">Marianne Williamson</a></cite></p></blockquote>
<p>The sex-negative strategy is composed of two major stages, each with its own primary tactic. First, scare; second, confuse. Both tactics are wielded against institutions (a political party, universities, medical associations, etc.) and individuals (activists, celebrities, researchers, journalists, etc.). In <a href="//maybemaimed.com/tag/sex-negative-patterns">this series of posts</a>, I examine these tactics closely, using real-world case studies and examples.</p>
<p>Although the actors and details of a particular situation are obviously unique, the overarching culture creates a cycle of abuse in which one can observe obvious patterns. Let&#8217;s begin by looking at a couple recent examples of the &#8220;scare&#8221; tactic.</p>
<h3>Fear-inducing messages and the media</h3>
<p>In the United Kingdom, reports of a surge of sexually active 11 year old girls have made headlines recently and are understandably concerning. However, <a href="http://www.drpetra.co.uk/blog/11-years-old-on-the-pill-and-sexually-active-the-media-loses-the-news-again/">as Dr. Petra Boynton elucidates</a>, the headlines are inaccurate:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.drpetra.co.uk/blog/11-years-old-on-the-pill-and-sexually-active-the-media-loses-the-news-again/"><p>Rise in 11 year olds on the pill (Sunday Times); One thousand girls on Pill at 11: Huge rise in contraceptive prescription for pre-teens without parents knowing (Daily Mail); Huge rise in 11-year-olds on the pill (Telegraph).</p>
<p>The UK appears afflicted by ‘soaring’ numbers of sexually active girls, who lie to parents, enabled by <acronym title="General Practitioner">GP</acronym>s. Is it accurate? No.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>This was picked up first by the Sunday Times then spread to other newspapers, websites and broadcast media. As we’ll see, journalists did not show due diligence in investigating the story.</p></blockquote>
<p>While sensationalist journalism is hardly eye-opening, what is important to observe is how sex-negative activists <em>employ</em> mass media to implant their revisionist reality in an anxious populace. As <a href="http://www.drpetra.co.uk/blog/11-years-old-on-the-pill-and-sexually-active-the-media-loses-the-news-again/">Dr. Petra says</a>, <q cite="http://www.drpetra.co.uk/blog/11-years-old-on-the-pill-and-sexually-active-the-media-loses-the-news-again/">There is an ongoing crusade by elements of the media to be anti young people, particularly young girls, and against all forms of sex education. And, as we’ve already heard, scandalous headlines about teenage nymphos sound a lot more exciting than</q> the real story. Dr. Petra correctly observes that <q cite="http://www.drpetra.co.uk/blog/11-years-old-on-the-pill-and-sexually-active-the-media-loses-the-news-again/">the media sets these stories up as moral debates where there are distinct baddies (doctors, trampy teens, and anyone offering sex education) and goodies (Christian/Family groups, parents)</q>.</p>
<p>And the kicker, as Dr. Petra also notes, the frenzy can be traced back to the Christian Medical Association, on which most of the reporting relied, but did <em>not</em> critique. Let me repeat that, because it&#8217;s very important: journalists <em>relied upon sources whom they did not question</em>.</p>
<p>Once journalists have a story, however, experts are put in the difficult position of re-contextualizing a decontextualized report. In <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00t7fjk">Dr. Petra&#8217;s words from BBC Radio</a>, <q cite="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00t7fjk">The problem with the story was it, I think, jumped to very extreme conclusions without explaining the wider data.</q> (Quote begins at 13:07 in the recording.) Moreover, when experts try to introduce rationality, <a href="https://twitter.com/drpetra/status/20313193767">they get the Third Degree</a>—they get the grilling the agenda-driven <em>source</em> should have gotten.</p>
<p>Through simple ignorance, over-eager sensationalizing, or intentional misreporting in the worst cases, journalists distributed fear-based messages that had parents scared about the well-being of their children, children unwittingly cast in the horrific role of untrustworthy miscreants, and sex-positive adults as (you guessed it) child exploiters. (Dr. Petra chronicles that <q cite="http://www.drpetra.co.uk/blog/11-years-old-on-the-pill-and-sexually-active-the-media-loses-the-news-again/">most of the calls I took from journalists today were seeking to pitch me into battle—cast in the un-winnable role of the ‘pro sex bogeywoman’.</q>) Only the bravest of sex-positive educators and activists would be willing to step into the fray at this point, so of course most remain quiet.</p>
<p>Again, while details across stories vary, the framework—a self-reinforcing <a href="http://www.blaghag.com/2009/09/anti-porn-event-emotional-appeals-and.html">catacomb of fear-based messaging and emotional appeals</a>—remains consistent. Observe, for instance, the recent love affair anti-porn activist Dr. Gail Dines is having with the media.</p>
<p>Gail Dines and her colleagues insist that <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/sexist/2010/06/28/the-anti-porn-position-from-child-porns-slippery-slope-to-frighteningly-thorough-bestiality/">when men view porn, it leads them to child molestation</a>, and <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/sexist/2010/07/21/anti-porn-scholar-watching-porn-get-women-raped/">when women view porn, it gets them gang-raped</a>. However, the actual <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/sexist/2010/06/21/subtlety-and-the-war-on-porn/">data tells a different story</a>. So insidiously effective is this <a href="http://www.charlieglickman.com/2010/07/7-ways-to-create-a-sex-positive-critique-of-porn/">tactic of fomenting moral panic</a> (and <a href="http://enagoski.wordpress.com/2010/07/02/porn-the-giraffe-of-the-sexually-explicit-media-world/">decontextualization</a>, which I&#8217;ll detail in an upcoming post) that Gail Dines even <a href="http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2010/07/07/porn-pleasure-or-profit-ms-interviews-gail-dines-part-ii/#IDComment89413280">headlines</a> in <a href="http://www.redgarterclub.com/SDChronBlog2dot5/2010/06/16/mother-jones-jumps-the-antiporn-shark/">left-wing women&#8217;s media</a>.</p>
<p>Look under the hood and you can see Gail Dines&#8217; campaign is <a href="http://ourpornourselves.org/stop-porn-culture/">promulgated by Christian groups and companies with explicit anti-gay histories</a>, that <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/sexist/2010/06/24/talking-sex-with-kink-educators-and-anti-porn-activists/#comment-77661">her most visible sidekick</a> is faith-based Pink Cross &#8220;<a href="http://www.juliemeadows.com/blog/2010/06/22/shelley-lubbenthe-pink-cross-financial-records/">charity</a>&#8221; founder <a href="http://www.juliemeadows.com/blog/2010/07/14/shelley-lubben-where-is-her-credibility-what-is-she-qualified-to-do/">Shelley Lubben</a>, or that among her most vocal supporters is former Bush-era Obscenity Task Force Prosecutor Patrick Trueman (whose own &#8220;Porn Harms&#8221; group <a href="http://iacb.blogspot.com/2010/07/violet-blues-ourporn-group-censored-by.html">crows with obvious delight</a> at <a href="http://days.maybemaimed.com/post/881329159/anti-porn-logic-would-censor-anti-porn-websites">censorship of sex-positive discussions</a>). Here too, the fear-inducing messages—and the thinly-veiled threat—is the same: &#8220;good girls don&#8217;t; <a href="http://quietgirlriot.wordpress.com/2010/05/23/the-opposite-of-rape/">men are predators</a>.&#8221; It is a centuries-old reinforcement of gender stereotypes and The Patriarchy, of all things!</p>
<p>Moreover, some of these people are journalists themselves, collaborate directly with sex-negative activists or, as is <a href="http://ourpornourselves.org/anti-porn-profiteering-what-theyre-selling/comment-page-1/#comment-85">the case with Julie Bindel</a>, both. <ins datetime="2010-08-14T09:21:32+00:00">(For her part, <a href="http://www.lauraagustin.com/important-enemies-hating-sex-work-academics-or-hating-research">Bindel has actually suggested that academics who disagree with her positions should be shot</a>.)</ins></p>
<p>This happens time and again, across all kinds of sexuality-related issues. <a href="http://KinkOnTap.com/?p=1039">Watch this pattern playing out <em>right now</em></a> about the <a href="http://eminism.org/blog/entry/61">misguided &#8220;end the demand&#8221; protests targeting Craigslist</a>. The media only rarely <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/us/06bcjames.html">mentions that the protests are organized by anti-prostitution activist Melissa Farley</a>, a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060111065947/http://www.woodhullfoundation.org/content/otherpublications/WeitzerVAW-1.pdf">questionable source</a> at best.</p>
<p>There are many people doing what they can to <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2010/03/27/addressing-donna-m-hughes-and-margaret-brooks-concerns-over-kinkforall-unconferences/">allay specific out-of-proportion fears</a>, but I see far fewer people striking at the root issue: the fear-based landscape itself. Although organized fear of this magnitude may win at the ballot box, creating laws that cause real harm, it has no place in the better society we all claim to want.</p>

As a trained lay sex-educator in my church (yes, there&#8217;s at least one church that believes that well-informed teens have the best chance of making the right decisions for themselves),I&#8217;m amazed at the things I read and hear that make me go &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t sound right&#8221;.  But I seldom take the time to chase them down to the ground.  Thanks for doing that.</p>
<p>You might want to check out weeklysift.blogspot.com &#8211; Doug Muder does much this same kind of unpacking of major media stories.  There&#8217;s a method of mis-representing reality here that gets applied to all sorts of things.</p>

More and more, as I&#8217;ve met people farther and farther removed from my high school and college science nerd friends, I&#8217;ve run into people who argue morals purely from what &#8220;feels right&#8221; to them.  It baffled me at first; I&#8217;ve known about a huge number of psychology experiments that showcase our intellectual and emotional biases as a species, and show how &#8220;gut feelings&#8221; are often extremely misleading, since I was in my early teens.  Later, I realized that a great deal of the education we receive as, especially, children and young adults <i>specifically caters to those faulty biases.</i>  </p>
<p>- Religious training for children focuses on evoking a desired set of emotional reactions to situations, for instance, with leading questions and a limited set of assumed scenarios.  &#8220;God said we shouldn&#8217;t ___.  Wouldn&#8217;t it be terrible if people ____ed, kids?  What kind of things can you think of that might happen if people ____ed all the time?&#8221;  (When I was a young teen, I assumed that this kind of instruction was just to simplify things for the kids; then I realized that the adult sermons were the same thing with more anecdotes presented as &#8220;evidence.&#8221;)  </p>
<p>- We also see a great deal of glorification of personal moral convictions in literature and other media (and especially through child- and young adulthood) &#8211; the hero or heroine whose thoughts we can see stands steadfast, sure in his/her moral rectitude, against a parodied opposition of Degenerates.  The emphasis is again on the fact that the hero &#8220;knows what is right in his heart.&#8221;  </p>
<p>- Finally, the whole traditional parenting paradigm is based around teaching your kids Obedience and Respect for Your Parental Authority.  &#8220;Because I said so&#8221; is still widely considered an acceptable &#8211; even appropriate! &#8211; reason for any instruction.  </p>
<p>Given these tendencies in many aspects of education, it&#8217;s no wonder the emotional manipulation and misuse of data so abound in society; many are taught from an early age 1) to rigidly adhere to what is Right; 2) what is Right is what some Respected Authority taught me; 3) I know it&#8217;s Right because I feel it Deep In My Heart; and 4) if sources disagree, but I find one to support my initial bias in some manner, I am still Right.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think, by any means, that this tendency means we&#8217;re just screwed until the majority of a generation can think for themselves.  However, it makes sense then that one of the best and most productive gifts we can give children is the imperative, encouragement, and freedom to think critically and rationally.  </p>

I don&#8217;t know if I agree with you, Dae. While I agree that &#8220;lack of critical thinking&#8221; is endemic to making people susceptible to fear-mongering, I find myself optimistically believing that &#8220;thinking&#8221; is, itself, a critical activity. The entire notion of teaching &#8220;critical thinking skills&#8221; in schools is therefore flawed, and that&#8217;s why I say the problem is engendered by public schools. Children are born with far more capabilities than we give them credit for—a real shame, in my book.</p>
<p>As for the arguments over gut feelings, I again see where you&#8217;re coming from, but disagree. Morality is a vital component to critical thinking, and so it cannot and should not be segregated from conviction. What is missing is not discussion of morality, but discussion of empathy and emotional intelligence. While morals and ethics can and are taught in schools, moral principles like diversity and acceptance are often sidelined. The key point, I think, is that these <em>are moral principles</em>.</p>
<p>Education certainly is a problem. People need to learn how to deal with personal emotions of disgust and revulsion, which are both perfectly acceptable behaviors, without resorting to hating and harming others. Their <a href="http://maybemaimed.com/2010/05/08/certain-unalienable-rights/" rel="nofollow">right to be disgusted at people like me ends with their ability to strip me of my rights</a>—rights that are explicitly designed to prevent people, including both me and those who hate me, from doing harm.</p>

<p>Those are some interesting points.  I&#8217;ve had similar discussions with my significant other about what kinds of roles emotional conviction can, does, and should play in morality.  I tend to agree with you that &#8220;thinking&#8221; necessarily refers to a critical activity, and a better word for me to have used in my last post would perhaps be &#8220;react.&#8221;  </p>
<p>However, I do believe that critical thinking skills can be taught to a degree, and that good schools facilitate that.  It&#8217;s not a matter of the rote study that a lot of people associate with teaching.  Rather, a good teacher asks open-ended questions, encourages the students to find and support their own answers, and gives them the skills to use the research tools that are available.  I have spoken to some people who don&#8217;t consider this sort of thing &#8220;teaching,&#8221; and I&#8217;m fine with that.  But that is what I mean when I speak of teaching critical thinking skills.  (I&#8217;ve also seen efforts for this *thoroughly* futzed up by pedagogues with an agenda, of course, and agree with you that children have more capacity for self-teaching than our society credits them with.  Some &#8211; most &#8211; are less inquisitive and independent than you seem to have been, however, and for them, a well-executed formal education has a place, to my mind.)  </p>
<p>On emotional intelligence, empathy, and morality &#8211; your argument makes sense to me, and that&#8217;s what reminded me of past conversations.  The biases of my viewpoint typically result in me trying to cut emotions out of the morality/critical thinking picture as much as possible, except insofar as positive emotions are always a desirable outcome of a decision.  I do think the best course is somewhere in the middle, drawing from both emotional and objective thought, and that you have the right of it in pointing out that some of the problems I was describing are the result of people being unable to deal with their negative emotions toward others and put that emotion in context.  (It&#8217;s perhaps a bit too easy for me to be reactionary against the idea of people acting on emotions at all because I&#8217;ve had to essentially play Vulcan through much of my life to avoid being dismissed as an over-emotional woman who only wants to play at being a gamer, a skeptic, and a scientist.)</p>
