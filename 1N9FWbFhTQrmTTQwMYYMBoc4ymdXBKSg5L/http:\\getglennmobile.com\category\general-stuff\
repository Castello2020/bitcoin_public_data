<p>As I wrote in my last entry, <span style="color:#ff0000;">I have the opportunity to acquire a pristine X-WAV already converted for wheelchair access 2008 Honda Element&#8230;I just heard back from the seller would like to take my unconverted one plus cash, and the bottom line is that to finalize the deal I only need $2500 more!</span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m imploring my friends and supporters to help. PLEASE help me finish this off, I&#8217;ll get my life restored as much as it can be, the look and scope of this blog will change from its current fundraiser purpose (I&#8217;m thinking &#8216;Liberty On Wheels&#8217; would be a snappy new name) and I can get back to the land of the living to not only LIVE again rather than just existing, but to join the press for a freer world for all of us.</p>
<p>You know me by now, the donations have only accrued and have been treated as sacrosanct by me over the past 2 1/2 years to their current level circa $11,000 and now I finally have the chance to use them as intended: getting me mobile. This is a <em>truly </em>critical time&#8230;won&#8217;t you PLEASE help me raise that last $2500 by Christmas?</p>
<p>Remember, all donors of $4 or more will receive that great 4-song thank you package donated by the terrific artists I&#8217;ve mentioned before, too!</p>

<p>It was glorious out today, and since I have another appointment with the pain management center tomorrow I took aadvantage of the weather to roll on over to the ATM to pull out some FRNs with which to pay the disabled taxi driver. While I venture onto my screened porch frequently and the driveway occasionally, there&#8217;s no comparison between these and really being <em>out</em> in the free air.</p>
<p>The time when I can do this at will is closer now than ever, if you&#8217;ve been listening to the Freedom Finders broadcast or seen my occasional Facebook posts you&#8217;ll know my good friends Rob and Jason have located a low-mileage Element already converted for exactly the X-WAV wheelchair access I need. Speaking with the seller, it turns out she may well be interested in an unmodified Element for her own use and mine would suit perfectly as part of the deal&#8230;talk about synchronicity!</p>
<p>Between my vehicle, the $11,000 or so in generous donations received so far, and the proceeds from the sale of my mom&#8217;s car (her health is at the point that she can&#8217;t drive any more), we&#8217;re very close to the seller of the X-WAV&#8217;s price. I hope some of you will see fit to donate a bit more; any amount in excess of the new X-WAV&#8217;s price will go toward maintaining my show&#8217;s capabilities and perhaps some newer A/V equipment, or worst case, if the deal should fall through an increase in donations will bring me closer to the original goal of modifying my Honda.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited and nervous&#8230;please donate any amount you can spare to finish the job of getting me mobile and letting me return to the land of the living to spread the word about the need to reclaim our precious liberties!</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" target="_blank">Moore&#8217;s Law</a> is actually more conjecture than canon, but it&#8217;s been pretty accurate over time. Intel cofounder Gordon Moore made the observation that &#8220;over the <a title="History of computing hardware" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware" target="_blank">history of computing hardware</a>, the number of <a title="Transistor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor" target="_blank">transistors</a> on <a title="Integrated circuit" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit" target="_blank">integrated circuits</a> doubles approximately every two years.&#8221; That&#8217;s why my latest computer, built for me in 2009 by a Craigslist friend (and hardly bleeding edge when new) has really been showing its near 5 years&#8217; age lately. I was unable to get SAM Broadcaster running on it, some programs were starting to crash unexpectedly, and program conflicts were causing bluescreen/reboot more frequently.</p>
<p>My mom, knowing how essential a reliable computer is for both of us, authorized me to get a new one as an early Christmas present. I headed over to <a href="http://www.cyberpowerpc.com/" target="_blank">CyberPowerPC</a>. They have a good reputation as the next best way to custom build a computer that has no proprietary limited parts after doing it yourself (with my left hand mostly shot, I really can&#8217;t). I saw a number of good choices, but I settled on their Scorpius 8000 model. Again it&#8217;s hardly bleeding edge, but with a 6-core AMD CPU and 8Gb of RAM should give me some years of good service before becoming obsolete. It&#8217;s been almost 5 years since I had to think about such things, but was surprised that a self contained and no-maintenance liquid cooling assembly for the CPU was a standard item!</p>
<p>Kinda cool, thought I, as I went through the configurator that allows you to customize the build. There were plenty of choices, but I really had no need for most; they&#8217;re either high-dollar component upgrades or cosmetic luxuries. In the end I settled on two upgrades: first, a slightly better-than-base Apevia X-Cruiser case for looks, accessibility and good airflow. Second, and more importantly, I upped the power supply from a rather anemic 350W generic unit to a Thermaltake 750W one. You rarely get into high power usage with the stuff I use a PC for, but on the rare occasion when you do, the last thing you need is a problem with the power supply.</p>
<p>A few short days later and the new machine was enroute. CyberPower&#8217;s smart, they use automated mass production to its best capabilities from assembly to quality control checking while still producing a custom machine to  satisfy each individual buyer, at a price that shames the big PC makers and distributors. I gotta say, it&#8217;s a spiffy looker!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cyberpowerpc.com/system/Gamer_Scorpius_8000" target="_blank"><img class="shrinkToFit decoded" alt="http://www.buyxg.com/images/cs/xcruiser3/cs-426-203.jpg" src="http://www.buyxg.com/images/cs/xcruiser3/cs-426-203.jpg" width="189" height="308" /></a></p>
<p>Along with the computer, my mom told me to add a decent external drive. I own one, but can&#8217;t rest until there are two for redundancy. Like a multiengine airplane, the odds of one dying are low, but the odds of <em>two</em> going Tango Uniform are astronomical. I don&#8217;t like the idea of losing my digital photos and documents, and my mom has a pile of digital stuff I&#8217;ve scanned for her, so she didn&#8217;t have a problem with kicking in to assure safe storage.</p>
<p>I decided on Silicon Power&#8217;s 1TB drive and ordered it from Amazon. I was eagerly expecting its arrival but I had to do something that evening when it showed as &#8216;delivered&#8217; even though it was nowhere to be seen. I knew right away what happened, UPS was using a fill-in driver who&#8217;d misdelivered it. When I called UPS to try having them contact the driver, they wouldn&#8217;t take reponsibility&#8230;since it showed as &#8216;delivered&#8217; I had to be the one in the wrong, you see.</p>
<p>Amazon really stepped up to the plate. When I told them what had happened, they cancelled the order for refund, had me order a new one and for lagniappe threw in next-day shipping. Love Amazon. Interestingly, the next day the original one turned up in my mailbox&#8230;obvioudly I have an honest neighbor! When the UPS fellow arrived bearing my new drive, he was kind enough to take the first one to return it to the seller. Mildy tempting to keep it though it was, it would have been theft, so I sent it back. Now the karma part: I saved an extra $5 when I ordered it the second time, got that next-day shipping, and had the satisfaction of knowing I did the moral thing&#8230;which was augmented when Amazon noticed the first unit was on its way back; they sent me a nice thank-you letter in appreciation of my honesty.</p>
<p>This drive is probably the nicest, best looking and easiest to use external HD I&#8217;ve ever seen. Powered by the USB port alone, there&#8217;s no external power supply to mess with, it lights a soft red to show it&#8217;s on that flashes while it&#8217;s in operation, its USB cable attaces to slots in the soft bumpers and it&#8217;s armored to withstand a substantial fall&#8230;not that I mean to test this, but others have and their drive kept right on working.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you can do any better than this SP Rugged Armor HD if you&#8217;re looking for a terabyte&#8217;s worth of portable storage. Longevity is unknown, but I&#8217;ll update my review if it dies.  For the moment though, color me happy!</p>

In the few days it&#8217;s been here, I can navigate around fine and have the programs and apps (yeah, like a tablet) working to my satisfaction. As one observer pointed out at CNET, refusing to learn a new OS is delaying the inevitable anyway. I&#8217;m no huge fan of Windoze, but I grudgingly confess I kinda like it!</p>
<p>Best of all, I got a copy of the latest edition of SAM Broadcaster, installed it and the virtual audio cables satisfactorily, and got it configured and tested today with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/april.reigne?fref=ts" target="_blank">April Reigne</a>&#8216;s able assistance, so now the <a href="http://weroar.tv/" target="_blank">Freedom Finders show</a> should have a lot more professional and polished feel to it. Ideally this will help spread the word about <em>Get Glenn Mobile!</em> too, so I&#8217;m enthusiastic about the way things are evolving!</p>

<p>As I wrote in my last entry, I was about to begin the process of assimilating myself into an entirely new facility to obtain the pain management care I need to get by, and I was mighty apprehensive. We see frequent reports of pain patients being dropped by their doctors, being cut off from the ability to obtain the drugs they need, or even assaulted, kidnapped and caged by the Law Enforcement arm of the State.</p>
<p>I was forced to make the transition because the DEA had descended upon my primary care physician and the pain management specialist he retains, threatening to pull everyones&#8217; professional certificates for the heinous non-crime of prescribing the meds their patients need, of actually <em>caring</em> for them as their occupations require. After seeing many ugly stories on the War on Pain Patients, needless to say I wasn&#8217;t expecting a pleasant time in dealing with this new facility.</p>
<p>How I enjoyed finding my apprehension was nothing but vaporous fears!</p>
<p>Everything went smoothly, from the desk person who took my paperwork, to the intake nurse, to the first meeting with my new pain management specialist and consulting physician. I wasn&#8217;t treated like mild on a Petri dish, nor was I interrogated about suicidal tendencies or whether I was a gun owner, unlike a bunch of other medical people I&#8217;ve encountered. They actually listened to my history, and surprised me when they heard about the monstrous neurologist who diagnosed me quickly but then turned on me and tried to make a compliant research subject out of me&#8230;including attempted blackmail&#8230;with their knowing acceptance of his behavior as I related to them. Evidently criminal doctors are more commonplace than I&#8217;d expected!</p>
<p>As to continuing the pain management regimen my previous pain management specialist and I had worked up over the past few years, my new advisors understood my aversion to altering it or worse, substituting any of Big Pharma&#8217;s substitutes that usually have a long list of unpleasant side effects associated with them.</p>
<p>They even expressed their willingness to accomodate me, once I&#8217;ve become fully involved with the facility over a few months&#8217; time, in only requiring me to appear every two months to refill my prescriptions. For a healthy person it&#8217;d be no big deal, but until this fundraiser&#8217;s completed, my Honda modified and my freedom of movement restored, remember I have to use a disabled taxi to get places. It isn&#8217;t overpriced at all, but it ain&#8217;t cheap.</p>
<p>All things considered, this visit was a win in every area given my limitations. With all of the verifiable troubles heaped on the disabled I don&#8217;t feel silly about preparing myself for a potentially unpleasant ordeal, but I sure was glad to find my fears unfounded in this case. Sorry it took a couple of days to make my report, but the stress and effort of this outing knocked me on my butt. I slept for nearly 12 hours Thursday night, and it took another day just to get back to my &#8216;normal&#8217; energy level and get to the recounting of the adventure.</p>
<p>This has been useful in its way though, one more example of my need for mobility and independence that only a suitable wheelchair accessible vehicle will bring back to my life, and I do hope that folks will consider how easily this can be accomplished with enough people making small donations to my cause. Don&#8217;t forget, anyone contributing $4 or more will receive the four song thank you package as an added incentive&#8230;so please drop whatever you can spare in the kitty. I can&#8217;t wait for this to be done so I can quit being a public pest soliciting donations and get down to the business of promoting liberty out in my local world or further!</p>

		<p><img class="decoded" alt="https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/994768_10151664961542381_1848221376_n.jpg" src="https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/994768_10151664961542381_1848221376_n.jpg" width="660" height="244" /></p>
<p>And people marvel at how cynical I&#8217;ve become.</p>
<p>I had a pretty good arrangement established with my physician&#8217;s office, he employs a specially trained pain management specialist and over the past couple of years she&#8217;s worked with me to tweak my intake of pain drugs to be the minimum possible while effectively damping the neuropathic pain caused by MS to a low enough level that I can function. Sure, I&#8217;m nowhere near as productive as a healthy person, and I&#8217;m never out of pain entirely, but with the small amount of drugs I ingest daily the pain level isn&#8217;t like a buzzing fly in my ear that keeps my mind distracted from whatever business at hand I&#8217;m trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>As I discussed in my <a href="http://getglennmobile.com/2013/09/27/oh-the-bureaucracy/" target="_blank">last post</a>, I now have to go to a dedicated pain management facility&#8230;and tomorrow&#8217;s the day. The knuckleheads at my doc&#8217;s office inadvertently bought me a few extra weeks&#8217; reprieve by not updating their records and I went on a wild goose chase last time since the office I&#8217;d picked was no longer there and had moved some distance away. There are&#8230;or were&#8230;only two such facilities reasonably close to me so the second one&#8217;s the only choice left.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;ll be making my first trip to see them, and I confess I&#8217;m not at all sanguine about the outcome. Recently this one, the &#8216;Center for Spine, Joint, and Neuromuscular Rehabilitation&#8217; sent me a sheaf of forms they require new patients to fill out. It was about <em>fifteen pages</em>, most of which are loaded with spaces for information. Like even my neurologist&#8217;s office&#8217; forms, they have to be manually filled out, a minor annoyance for most people, but remember that with my dominant left hand&#8217;s function severely limited by MS,<em> I simply can&#8217;t do hand writing.</em> I had to enlist my mom to assist, but I&#8217;m pretty appalled that in this day and age these forms can&#8217;t be digitized so they could be completed with a keyboard for folks like me. The cheapest junk PC with a Word or .pdf editor couldd handle the job&#8230;but so far these &#8216;experts&#8217; haven&#8217;t got the memo.</p>
<p>Worse, the language is mighty authoritarian in nature, filled with all sorts of privacy invasions and penalties for not following each edict to the letter. Like the Social (IN) Security disability process I endured, again I&#8217;m being treated like a criminal. There&#8217;s even a provision for them to count my pain pills if they get the urge, to make sure I&#8217;m not gobbling them like candy. Un-freakin-believable.</p>
<p>With an adverse tone and demeanor already established, I have a feeling they&#8217;re going to cut my pain meds off, since the Holy Drug Warriors have adopted a punishment ethic against chronic pain patients. I talked about some of the ugly stories in the <a href="http://www.americandailyherald.com/pundits/glenn-horowitz/item/real-warriors-oppose-the-state-s-war-on-cannabis" target="_blank">article</a> I wrote last year for the American Daily Herald, now I get to see the process firsthand.</p>
<p>The irony is I wouldn&#8217;t need the pain meds I take at anywhere near the level they&#8217;re now at if I were able to get out in the world and busy myself with the many things I want to do.</p>
<p>Beside the obvious fact that I&#8217;m not dumb or reckless enough to drive under the influence of pain drugs, while I may never be out of pain, I&#8217;ve seen in the infrequent times when I&#8217;m occupied doing something <em>real</em>, the activity submerges that pain to a far less significant level and it can be ignored. Sounds subjective, but there&#8217;s all the difference between being stuck in one place where the pain can demand my attention and being immersed in a dynamic activity that banishes it into near-insignificance.</p>
<p>So you can see that the need for recovering my mobility is greater than ever. I&#8217;ll keep the writing and broadcasting up even if I get stuck with an even higher pain level and will not knuckle under to it, but I know I could do so much more with my liberty of movement restored.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">PLEASE help me do this, we&#8217;ve raised just under half of the needed amount but there&#8217;s still a ways to go and I implore the world out there for a hand in achieving this, it&#8217;s more urgent than ever!</span></p>
<p>You haven&#8217;t seen even a <em>fraction</em> yet of what I&#8217;ll be able to do in promoting liberty, the nonagression principle and sound currency once I get back to the Land of the Living!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll keep everyone updated as to how all this turns out&#8230;wish me luck, and count on a full report soon.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=X7FYQFWYC2BYC" target="_blank"><img class="decoded" alt="https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/994768_10151664961542381_1848221376_n.jpg" src="https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/994768_10151664961542381_1848221376_n.jpg" width="600" height="222" /></a></p>
<p>As I detailed in my last entry, yesterday I boarded my disabled taxi and headed off to my consultation with the pain management center to continue my pain drug approval. As we left, I had an unsettling flash that it wasn&#8217;t going to go well for me. I&#8217;ve had the odd feeling before with no unpleasant results so I decided I was being obstructively anxious.</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>As we reached the area my driver had entered in his GPS, there was nothing in sight that looked anything like a medical facility. A couple of phone calls confirmed it; the center had moved to a location prohibitively far away months ago, yet my physician&#8217;s office had never updated their records.</p>
<p>Hopping mad, I phoned the only other pain management center within a reasonable distance from my home to begin the process again. When I discovered that the first available appointment was October 24, it felt like I&#8217;d been sucker punched&#8230;my current supply of pain drugs will be exhausted right after the first week of October.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve explained previously, at this point in time I genuinely need the drugs to damp down the constant neuropathic pain I experience in order to function. While not screamingly severe, the pain resulting from nerves stripped of their insulating myelin coat by MS and essentially stuck full time in the &#8216;on&#8217; position is enough to drive all else from my mind, rendering me incapable of carrying out daily tasks beyond the most basic ones a person has to do just to exist.</p>
<p>I went home, made a few more calls and eventually had my call returned by a nurse at my physician&#8217;s office, who not only took responsibility for the snafu, but obtained a new prescription to cover the interim period until late October.</p>
<p>I dodged the bullet, but was reminded yet again what a dehumanizing affliction I&#8217;m dealing with. I need the power wheelchair just to move, I&#8217;m dependant on chemicals to function, and narrowly averted a looming disaster when the supply of drugs was threatened. These are anathema to a person like me, who has always been an independent and self sufficient sort. I feel like I&#8217;m in an alien and hostile environment, like an explorer in space or on another planet, reliant on machines and pharmaceuticals, a never ending need for support equipment.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s bad enough, the facts are the facts, I know perfectly well that life&#8217;s not fair and I can cope with these factors. What I find unacceptable is how the unpleasant events of the day were caused directly by government intervention with its insane War On Some Drugs and its naasty offshoot, the war on pain patients.</p>
<p>Lest anyone dismiss this subject as unrelated to thir lives, something not their problem, it has significance for all Americans. The fact that I&#8217;m threatened with violence for putting any substance I see fit that the government doesn&#8217;t like in my body is clear proof that these so-called &#8216;leaders&#8217; in America responsible for the War On Some Drugs don&#8217;t believe you own your body, simple as that. That makes everyone their slave, when you strip away the flowery rhetoric, and I reject that idea, as should anyone who believes in liberty.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m grateful to have the forum for the <em>Freedom Finders</em> show available on the WeROAR network, because this was the topic that guest Brandon Council and I discussed tonight. The US government has incrementally usurped most of the fundamental human rights Americans have taken for granted for too many years, and it&#8217;s going to take a lot of effort  to recover them from Leviathan.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve seen with the mountains of laws spewed from DC (beginning well befor the odious USA-PATRIOT Act if you do your research), the government thinks you are its chattel, to be used, abused, or discarded at their whim. The Welfare/Warefare State, the metastasized police state and the US&#8217; devastating interventionist foreign policy, along with the rest of the antihuman collectivist practices the government manufactures the vast majority of the problems we face are terribly dangerous to all of us. The tighter the impersonal gears of the bureaucratic machine enclose us, the likelier we&#8217;ll be caught in those gears and devoured.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve referenced the studies of democide, death by government, by  <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/" target="_blank">RJ Rummel</a> many times: we now face a government that&#8217;s accued a huge amount of unaccountable power in a relatively tiny number of hands, and historically that invariably results in vast numbers of prople murdered by their own governments&#8230;around 262 <em>million</em> by Rummel&#8217;s estimate over the twentieth century, a number that excludes the millions who&#8217;ve died as combatants in war. I can only hope that the American public finally accepts the reality of the hazard before it&#8217;s too late. Psychopathic power crazed people who create these situations are immoral and vicious, but they&#8217;ve always been bullies and cowards and <em>will</em> back down if enough people withdraw their consent from their control. Seeing them accelerating their monstrous plans is dismaying, but such types are also historically blinded by hubris, by overweening pride, that is so extreme that we may indeed see sufficient Americans alerted to their criminally murderous schemes and realize just how much is at stake in time to peacefully thwart them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;m not backing down, nor slacking in my efforts to regain my freedom of mobility. I will not surrender my life without resisting, and I&#8217;m confident I can be an asset to others fighting for our freedoms once I can get out to confront the goons. I wish it would happen faster, but the slow progress of my fundraiser is what it is; as an entirely voluntary effort I know that nobody owes me a thing and it&#8217;s up to me to persuade them to help me correct this unjust situation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be documenting my experiences with the system, count on it. Sunlight really is the best disinfectant, and I&#8217;m trying to spread that light as far as I can to wake people from their somnolent state and convince them that it&#8217;s well past the time to stand up to these creeps, so even if it&#8217;s only in their self interest to do so, we can finally see the wave of tyranny crest, break and roll back.</p>

<p>When I visited my doctor&#8217;s office nearly two months ago to see my pain management specialist, I was seen not by her, but by another of the staff professionals who had some unpleasantly surprising news for me.</p>
<p>It seems that the Holy Drug Warriors from the DEA were all over my doctor and even though my pain management specialist is an accredited professional, they threatened everyone in the office with suspension or revocation of their medical credentials if they continued to prescribe any but the most mild of pain drugs for people like me, and in future I&#8217;d have to go to a specialized pain management facility if I was to keep getting the oxycodone that I need to damp down the constant moderate neuropathic pain I deal with from my multiple sclerosis in order to function daily.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve explained it before, this moderate pain is not severe, thankfully, but without the drug it&#8217;s like a loud fly buzzing in my ear&#8230;it drives all else out and I can&#8217;t concentrate on anything creative or useful. Mind you, I&#8217;m pretty much a lightweight as to the needed dosage, the pain is always there, but the oxy suppresses it enough so that I can get things done, and that&#8217;s enough. Unfortunately, the Drug Warriors don&#8217;t consider even the pain management specialist in my doc&#8217;s office sufficiently controlled to continue prescribing it for me.</p>
<p>So, tomorrow is my first visit to the new facility. I&#8217;m not very sanguine about this, with the war against pain patients and the doctors who care for them, the bureaucrats presume that these medical professionals aren&#8217;t &#8216;tough enough on drugs&#8217; and have comitted some atrocious acts against both patients and doctors to support this ludicrous antidrug theatre. I want to keep functioning, so I&#8217;ll go, but I&#8217;m appalled that after putting in the time and effort to work with my specialist, I now have to start all over bulding a new relationship with someone else.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m concerned, given all we&#8217;ve seen about the government co-opting so many doctors and other medical professionals to further their agenda, that I may face a hostile environment when I go. I can easily imagine pressure being put on me to give up the drugs that have proven consistently reliable, accept a lesser dosage than the already minor one I use, or worse, accept some ghastly alternative from Big Pharma that is likely to be less effective as well as bringing some hazardous side effects along with it as we&#8217;ve seen so many times before.</p>
<p>From past experience with some of these co-opted medical types I&#8217;m also expecting some quizzing trying to get me to indicate some sort of self destructive or even suicidal behavior to be used as an excuse to press Big Pharma&#8217;s antidepressant drugs on me, especially the notorious SSRIs that have been shown time and again to actually create such behavior or even outwardly destructive behavior in people. No dice, I will <em>never</em> consent to taking these. I&#8217;m not self destructive, I know my own mind and body reasonably well, and I refuse to join the long grey line of zombified people who&#8217;ve been sucked into taking them.</p>
<p>The kicker is that I&#8217;ve seen that when I&#8217;m occupied by doing something real, like when I was able to spend the day at the Music City Liberty Fest last November, it&#8217;s enough to make that moderate pain far less noticeable, just one more reason I so need to get mobile and recover the ability to get out and do the many things I need to. That will lessen my need for pain drugs itself, which is my desire anyway. The less unnatural chemicals I ingest, the better, but being cooped up without being able to do these things lets the pain get to me as I&#8217;ve seen over the years.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be documenting my experience as best I can and we&#8217;ll see how accurate my concerns are. I honestly hope I&#8217;m worrying unnecessarily and am overestimating these unpleasant possibilities, but it&#8217;s pretty obvious that getting mobile ASAP can only bring a host of positives! I hope you&#8217;ll spare any amount you can to help free me, and remember too that anyone donating $4 or more will receive the 4 song thank-you package from those terrific artists!</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=X7FYQFWYC2BYC" target="_blank"><img class="decoded" alt="https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/994768_10151664961542381_1848221376_n.jpg" src="https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/994768_10151664961542381_1848221376_n.jpg" width="600" height="222" /></a></p>
<p>Just checking in today&#8230;one of the traits of the internet, I&#8217;ve noticed, is that if a site (especially a fundraising site like this) falls dormant for too long, it effectively ceases to exist for many people since it&#8217;s not in their proximity radar.</p>
<p>Not I, I&#8217;m in it for the haul, as I&#8217;ve stated plenty of times before. My goal of modifying my Honda for wheelchair access isn&#8217;t a luxury or a &#8216;gee-it&#8217;d be-nice-to-have&#8217; device, and it certainly isn&#8217;t frivolous. No, it&#8217;s an absolutely essential addition if I&#8217;m ever to recover a lot of my life that multiple sclerosis snatched away. Not a gripe, but a reminder; imagine yourself unable to accomplish the zillions of things you can do now without any real thought or effort. There&#8217;s just no way to use a disabled capable taxi for these, at a $40-$50 minimum or more per trip, that&#8217;d be an express ticket to the poorhouse. In even a clinical and emotionless view, I&#8217;m losing my humanity as this confinement continues by the unchanging and very limited factors of my existence, and I for one will be overjoyed once I recover that freedom of mobility and begin rebuilding my confidence in myself that&#8217;s been eroded simply through inability to do the things I <em>can</em>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s so much going on in our world that I also feel a constant compulsion to get out and involve myself in it, interviewing, reporting on and just interacting with the public. I have no illusions that my input can effect huge changes for the better, but I&#8217;ve maintained for a long time that restoring and preserving liberty requires all of us to cooperate as best we can in promoting freedom to the majority of Americans still stuck in the vicious circle of conventional politics. I try to do what I can, occasionally writing and regularly broadcasting, with an emphasis on real world and viable means to combat the spreading darkness of tyranny. This is such a critical time for Americans and others around the world, and the forces of fear and control sure do seem overwhelming at times, but the alternative is to aquiesce and allow your consent to them, which is just unacceptable to me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to repeatedly demonstrate that the goons are by no means as powerful as they&#8217;d like us to think they are, that they need us while we don&#8217;t need them at all&#8230;and the puffed up scary display is not only inaccurate, but serves as a distraction for the fact that we outnumber them by many orders of magnitude, and could peacefully dispose of them simply by withdrawing our <a href="http://mises.org/document/1218" target="_blank">consent</a> to their lethal power crazed control. I&#8217;m pleased that after ages of recommending the film A Bug&#8217;s Life for showing how easily this can be communicated to people, and as I expected, someone had gone to the trouble of posting the salient clip, one more tool to deflate the propaganda. Thank goodness for YouTube!:</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='604' height='370' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/YPPT_NwRYuI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>For the moment, I&#8217;ll keep doing that, while searching for ways to make my site and voice more visible and audible, the $11,000+ accrued over the past couple of years validates the notion that if I can reach new people, a small percentage will reliably contribute, even a little, to help.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ll keep on keeping on, and I know that sooner or later my persistence will pay off and I&#8217;ll get my freedom back.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of my time looking for great guests to speak with on the <a href="http://weroar.ws/" target="_blank"><em>Freedom Finders</em></a> show I host, and I think folks will like what&#8217;s in the works for future shows. The fundraiser itself continues, and I want to make sure that everyone knows that while the Grand Prizes for donors from time to time are available&#8230;or not&#8230;I like the idea of providing some immediate quid pro quo for anyone donating $4 or more, and I&#8217;ll keep sending the thank-you package of 4 really good original songs to these donors. Not only can you do a moral good by helping remedy an unjust situation, but you&#8217;ll get some immediate bang for the buck.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t before, please drop a few bucks in the fund if you can, and tell your friends and family about this project, if you would. The sooner this gets done, the sooner I can get to work, limited though it is, on a much more effective level. Plus, I really hate being the public nuisance I&#8217;ve had to become and will be one very happy person when I no longer have to keep looking for that hand up.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that <a href="http://weroar.ws/" target="_blank"><em>Freedom Finders</em></a> show every Wednesday and Thursday evening beginning at 9PM Central/ 10PM Eastern, the best is yet to come!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been keeping busy with hosting the Freedom Finders show on <a href="http://weroar.ws/" target="_blank">WeROAR</a>, interviewing some great guests and little by slowly uploading past shows to the revamped <a href="http://www.weroar.tv/tube/" target="_blank">WeROAR Tube</a>. The campaign to free me has been fairly stagnant for the past year, so I&#8217;m exploring options for a Plan B to accomplish the goal using the donations received so far&#8230;$11,000 plus is nothing to sneeze at and I figure there has to be a way to solve this dilemma.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d still prefer to go with the original plan, so Get Glenn Mobile! will continue as a fundraiser. With that in mind, donors who contribute $4 or (hopefully) more will continue to receive the <a href="http://getglennmobile.com/2013/06/04/the-challenge/" target="_blank">4-song thank-you package</a>. There may be further Grand Prizes depending on whether my friends and allies care to donate something for the cause.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;m pleased to announce that the August contest has a winner. I held the drawing the other night as it was a good time, quiet with no guests to interview. Simple enough, I pulled up a random number generator from the net, with a range including the number of donors, with the oldest being &#8217;1&#8242; and proceeding from there.</p>
<p>So congratulations to donor <span style="color:#00ff00;">Carrie Kim</span>, with my compliments. You should be receiving your copy of <em>The American Constitution: Cases and Materials</em> soon in the mail.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawbooksforless.com/the-american-constitution-cases-and-materials-american-casebook-series.9780314247179.01.htm#.UizWZX9228B" target="_blank"><img class="decoded" alt="http://www.lawbooksforless.com/media/catalog/product/cache/3/image/145x/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/a/c/acs_474/The-American-Constitution:-Cases-and-Materials-(American-Casebook-Series)-9780314247179-32.jpg" src="http://www.lawbooksforless.com/media/catalog/product/cache/3/image/145x/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/a/c/acs_474/The-American-Constitution:-Cases-and-Materials-%28American-Casebook-Series%29-9780314247179-32.jpg" width="221" height="221" /></a></p>
<p>Now for the bad news: I stretched the contest out as long as I could, but in the end there were only 9 donors. Please, folks, if you&#8217;ve been holding back, I&#8217;d sure appreciate if you kick in now. You get a nice quid pro quo for your money with that 4 song thank-you package, plus once I&#8217;m free I can do my best to spread the message of freedom with my writing, broadcasting and just talking to people infinitely more effectively in public than from my desk, PLUS you&#8217;ll not only be doing a decent thing to help rectify an unjust situation, but you&#8217;ll be helping put a perfect example of the superiority of private and voluntary charitable action on record to point to. When discussing this with government loving friends or family it&#8217;ll be a very effective tool for making the point that we as individuals persuading people to donate to good causes voluntarily is a far more successful&#8230;not to mention moral&#8230;strategy than the government&#8217;s way of coercing largesse at gunpoint.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s up to YOU, all of you, who care about liberty to see this through and make it happen, simple as that.</p>
