TAGS:  PTER 
SUBJECT:  ABU NIDAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION 
 
1.  SECRET -ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF AN ANALYSIS OF THE 
ACTIVITIES OF THE ABU NIDAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION 
PREPARED BY THE US INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY: 
 
ABU NIDAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION 
 
BACKGROUND: 
 
THE ABU NIDAL GROUP IS AMONG THE MOST DANGEROUS AND 
RUTHLESS OF THE MIDDLE EASTERN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. 
IT IS PROBABLY THE BEST ORGANIZED AND MOST EFFECTIVE OF 
THE RADICAL PALESTINIAN TERRORIST GROUPS, CAREFULLY 
PLANNING ITS OPERATIONS AND KEEPING ITS INFORMATION 
TIGHTLY COMPARTMENTED.  FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS, THE 
ORGANIZATION HAS CONCENTRATED ON JORDANIAN AND PRO-ARAFAT 
PLO TARGETS, BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT IT IS AGAIN 
BROADENING ITS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE. 
 
THE ORGANIZATION HAS A NUMBER OF COVER NAMES INCLUDING 
BLACK JUNE, NO LONGER USED, AND THE FATAH REVOLUTIONARY 
COUNCIL.  MORE RECENTLY, IT HAS BEGUN USING THE NAME ARAB 
REVOLUTIONARY BRIGADES WHEN STAGING ATTACKS AGAINST GULF 
TARGETS AND EGYPT.  IT ALSO CALLS ITSELF BLACK SEPTEMBER 
IN ATTACKS AGAINST JORDANIAN AND PALESTINIAN TARGETS, AND 
THE REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION OF SOCIALIST MUSLIMS 
(ROSM) IN ATTACKS AGAINST BRITISH TARGETS. 
 
THE ABU NIDAL GROUP WAS FORMED IN 1974 FROM ELEMENTS 
WHICH BROKE AWAY FROM ARAFAT'S FATAH ORGANIZATION AFTER 
HE ANNOUNCED A BAN ON PLO INVOLVEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM OUTSIDE ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. 
THE GROUP IS HEADED BY SABRI AL-BANNA WHO GOES BY THE 
NAME OF ABU NIDAL.  UNLIKE MANY TERRORIST GROUPS, 
HOWEVER, IT IS SO WELL ORGANIZED, THAT IT CAN FUNCTION 
WITH OR WITHOUT ITS LEADER.  INDEED, BEFORE A NOVEMBER 
19, L985 INTERVIEW FROM LIBYA, ABU NIDAL WAS WIDELY 
RUMORED TO BE DEAD.  THE ABU NIDAL GROUP ALSO APPEARS TO 
BE LESS DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE FINANCING THAN OTHER GROUPS, 
IN PART BECAUSE OF ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE INCOME ON ITS 
OWN. 
 
THE GROUP IS COMMITTED TO THE USE OF VIOLENCE TO DESTROY 
DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO RECONCILE ISRAEL AND THE ARAB 
STATES.  IT ALSO CALLS FOR THE OVERTHROW OF ALL 
CONSERVATIVE AND MODERATE ARAB REGIMES AS WELL AS FOR THE 
DESTRUCTION OF MODERATE ELEMENTS IN THE PLO, NOTABLY 
ARAFAT'S FATAH ORGANIZATION.  IT CONTENDS THAT BOTH 
INTER-ARAB AND INTRA-PALESTINIAN TERRORISM ARE NEEDED TO 
CREATE AN ALL EMBRACING ARAB REVOLUTION WHICH WILL IN 
TURN LIBERATE PALESTINE.  TO FURTHER ITS REVOLUTIONARY 
AIMS, IT WILL ALSO STRIKE AT EUROPEAN AND OTHER TARGETS 
IF IT BELIEVES THAT THERE IS ANY TACTICAL ADVANTAGE IN 
DOING SO. 
 
MEMBERSHIP IN THE ORGANIZATION PROBABLY NUMBERS SEVERAL 
HUNDRED.  IT HAS CELLS THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST, SOUTH 
ASIA AND EUROPE.  OPERATIONAL GROUPS ARE SMALL, NUMBERING 
ONE TO THREE, EACH WITH GOOD OPERATIONAL SECURITY AND 
GOOD COMPARTMENTALIZATION.  OPERATIONS ARE SUPPORTED BY 
CAREFULLY COLLECTED, ON-TARGET INTELLIGENCE.  THE ABU 
NIDAL ORGANIZATION ALSO MAKES USE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF 
PALESTINIAN STUDENTS STUDYING ABROAD, SOMETIMES INVOLVING 
THEM IN OPERATIONS AFTER ONLY PERFUNCTORY TRAINING. 
 
LINKAGES TO OTHER GROUPS AND STATES: 
 
THE ABU NIDAL GROUP IS IN MANY WAYS A ROGUE 
ORGANIZATION.  WHILE MAINTAINING ITS RADICAL PALESTINIAN 
OUTLOOK, IT HAS LINKED UP WITH VARIOUS ARAB PATRONS, 
PRESUMABLY FOR FINANCIAL AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT AS MUCH 
AS, IF NOT MORE THAN, FOR IDEOLOGICAL AFFINITY. 
 
WHEN FIRST ORGANIZED, THE GROUP CAME UNDER THE PATRONAGE 
OF IRAQ.  WHEN SADDAM HUSAYN FINALLY EXPELLED ABU NIDAL 
AND THE REMNANTS OF HIS GROUP IN MID-1983, HE MOVED TO 
SYRIA.  SINCE THEN, THE ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN CONDUCTING 
OPERATIONS AGAINST JORDAN, MODERATE PALESTINIANS AND 
ARAFAT'S MAINLINE PLO, PRESUMABLY WITH THE SUPPORT AND 
COOPERATION OF SYRIAN INTELLIGENCE. 
 
IN RECENT MONTHS, ABU NIDAL HAS SHOWN SIGNS OF BECOMING 
MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH QADHAFI. THOUGH THE GROUP STILL 
MAINTAINS A HEADQUARTERS IN DAMASCUS (AND POSSIBLY ONE IN 
THE BIQA''VALLEY), ABU NIDAL HIMSELF IS APPARENTLY 
CURRENTLY RESIDING IN LIBYA.  HE HAS GRANTED SEVERAL 
INTERVIEWS FROM LIBYA AND HAS SPOKEN HIGHLY OF QADHAFI IN 
THEM. 
 
LINKAGE BETWEEN THE ABU NIDAL GROUP AND OTHER TERRORIST 
GROUPS IS MORE DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN.  THE GROUP IS VERY 
TIGHTLY ORGANIZED AND CONTROLLED AND, FOR SECURITY 
REASONS, DOES NOT APPEAR TO COOPERATE CLOSELY WITH OTHER 
TERRORIST GROUPS.  THIS DOES NOT RULE OUT NON-OPERATIONAL 
COOPERATION WHEN THE GROUP BELIEVES THERE IS SUFFICIENT 
TACTICAL ADVANTAGE.  FOR EXAMPLE, IT HAS ADMITTED IN AN 
INTERVIEW TO GROWING COOPERATION WITH EUROPEAN 
ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE IRA. 
 
CURRENT OPERATIONS: 
 
THE ABU NIDAL GROUP HAS REPEATEDLY DEMONSTRATED ITS 
ABILITY TO OPERATE IN ANY COUNTRY IT CHOOSES AND HAS 
SHOWN NO SIGNS OF ESCHEWING OPERATIONS IN COUNTRIES 
SYMPATHETIC TO THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE, PARTICULARLY IN ITS 
ANTI-ARAFAT OPERATIONS.  THE ORGANIZATION HAS STAGED 
ATTACKS IN 18 COUNTRIES ON THREE CONTINENTS, AND HAS 
CONDUCTED OVER 60 TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE LAST EIGHT 
YEARS, 30 SINCE 1984 AND 11 SINCE JULY OF THIS YEAR. 
 
IN RECENT INTERVIEWS, NOTABLY ONE IN DER SPIEGEL, LAST 
MONTH, ABU NIDAL HIMSELF HAS MADE THREATS AGAINST MANY 
COUNTRIES AND WORLD LEADERS, INCLUDING PRESIDENT MUBARAK, 
PRIME MINISTER THATCHER AND PRESIDENT REAGAN.  HIS 
TIRADES AGAINST JEWS HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY VIRULENT. 
ESPECIALLY SINCE 1984, ABU NIDAL HAS CONCENTRATED ON 
JORDANIANS AND PRO-ARAFAT PLO OFFICIALS.  THESE ATTACKS 
WERE PROVOKED IN LARGE MEASURE BY THE JORDANIAN AGREEMENT 
TO HOST THE PNC MEETING IN NOVEMBER 1984 AND BY KING 
HUSSEIN'S FEBRUARY ACCORD WITH ARAFAT TO RESTART THE 
ARAB-ISRAELI PEACE PROCESS.  THE ATTACKS ON JORDANIANS IN 
1985 HAVE INCLUDED: 
 
-- NOVEMBER 24 ASSASSINATION OF A PALESTINIAN IN AMMAN BY 
THREE ABU NIDAL AGENTS. 
 
- THE MURDER OF A JORDANIAN PUBLISHER IN ATHENS IN 
SEPTEMBER. 
 
-- A PLOT TO ASSASSINATE THE JORDANIAN AMBASSADOR TO 
GREECE BY A PALESTINIAN ARRESTED BY GREEK POLICE IN 
AUGUST. 
 
-- AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTACK ON A JORDANIAN DIPLOMAT ON 
AUGUST 5, BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN INITIATED BY ABU NIDAL. 
 
- THE MURDER OF A JORDANIAN DIPLOMAT IN TURKEY ON 
JULY 24. 
 
-- ON JULY 1, A BOMB EXPLODED AT THE BRITISH AIR TICKET 
OFFICE IN MADRID ALSO DAMAGING THE TWA OFFICE UPSTAIRS. 
NEARBY, THE JORDANIAN AIRLINE OFFICE WAS HIT BY AUTOMATIC 
WEAPONS FIRE AND TWO GRENADES WHICH DID NOT EXPLODE.  IN 
ALL, ONE WAS KILLED AND 24 WERE WOUNDED. 
 
-- AMAN CLAIMING TO BE WITH BLACK SEPTEMBER FIRED A 
ROCKET AT THE JORDANIAN EMBASSY IN ROME IN 
APRIL. 
 
-- AN ABU NIDAL ROCKET ATTACK ON A JORDANIAN AIRLINER 
TAKING OFF FROM ATHENS IN APRIL.  THE ROCKET HIT THE 
PLANE BUT DID NOT EXPLODE. 
 
-- IN DECEMBER, THE JORDANIAN DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION IN 
BUCHAREST WAS KILLED GETTING INTO HIS CAR. 
 
THE GROUP HAS ALSO TARGETED BRITISH INTERESTS.  ROSM 
CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MARCH 1985 KIDNAPPING OF A 
BRITISH JOURNALIST IN LEBANON AND THE ASSASSINATION OF 
BRITISH DIPLOMATS IN INDIA AND GREECE IN 1984.  THE 
PURPOSE OF THESE ATTACKS IS PROBABLY TO FORCE THE UK TO 
RELEASE ABU NIDAL MEMBERS IMPRISONED FOR THE ATTEMPTED 
ASSASSINATION OF THE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR IN LONDON IN JUNE 
1982. 
 
BASED ON THE STYLE OF ABU NIDAL ATTACKS, IT IS EVIDENT 
 
THAT THE GROUP IS WILLING TO CAUSE INDISCRIMINATE 
CASUALTIES.  APART FROM THE ASSASSINATION OF PARTICULAR 
INDIVIDUALS, ABU NIDAL OPERATIONS IN 1985 RESULTED IN 
NINE DEATHS AND 201 WOUNDED AMONG INNOCENT BYSTANDERS NOT 
COUNTING THE VICTIMS IN THE EGYPT AIR TRAGEDY.  HAD THE 
JORDANIAN AIRLINER HIT BY AN ABU NIDAL ROCKET TAKING OFF 
FROM ATHENS AIRPORT CRASHED, THE NUMBER COULD HAVE BEEN 
MUCH HIGHER.  IN 1983, 111 DIED IN THE CRASH OF A GULF 
AIRLINES JET ON WHICH AN ABU NIDAL BOMB EXPLODED.  TWO 
THIRDS OF THE GROUP'S 19 ATTACKS THIS YEAR HAVE TAKEN 
PLACE IN WESTERN EUROPE.  EUROPEAN CITIZENS HAVE 
INCREASINGLY BECOME CASUALTIES AND INTERESTS OF EUROPEAN 
COUNTRIES ARE INCREASINGLY DAMAGED BY THESE ACTIONS. 
 
THE GROUP'S ABILITY TO MOVE AT WILL IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES 
THEIR ACTIVITIES HARDER TO TRACE.  TO FACILITATE TRAVEL, 
THE ORGANIZATION HAS A RECORD OF USING MOROCCAN AND OTHER 
NORTH AFRICAN TRAVEL DOCUMENTS INCLUDING THOSE PRODUCED 
BY ITS OWN FORGING OPERATION.  SOME COUNTRIES SUCH AS 
YUGOSLAVIA HAVE BEEN MORE PERMISSIVE THAN OTHERS IN 
ALLOWING ABU NIDAL MEMBERS FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT, 
APPARENTLY HOPING THAT THIS WILL BUY THEM A MODICUM OF 
IMMUNITY FROM TERRORIST ACTS.  THERE IS GROWING 
RECOGNITION THAT THIS IS A DUBIOUS ASSUMPTION. 
NEVERTHELESS, TAKING LEGAL ACTION IS SOMETIMES 
DIFFICULT.  IN OCTOBER, AN ALLEGED HIGH RANKING ABU NIDAL 
FIGURE USING SPAIN AS A BASE WAS ACQUITTED BY A SPANISH 
COURT OF BEING A MEMBER OF A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. 
 
AMONG THE ATTACKS INVOLVING INNOCENT BYSTANDERS ARE: 
 
-- THE NOVEMBER 23 EGYPT AIR HIJACKING TO MALTA WHICH 
TOOK 60 LIVES.  THE ARAB REVOLUTIONARY BRIGADES, A COVER 
NAME FOR ABU NIDAL, CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE HIJACKING, AND 
THERE IS CORROBORATING EVIDENCE THAT IT WAS AN ABU NIDAL 
OPERATION.  THE ACT ALSO BORE THE SIGNATURE OF THE ABU 
NIDAL GROUP. 
 
-- THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT ARRESTED IN NOVEMBER A 12-MAN 
TEAM OF ABU NIDAL TERRORISTS INTENDING TO ATTACK THE 
ISRAELI CONSULATE IN ISTANBUL. 
 
-- ON SEPTEMBER 30, A BOMB EXPLODED NEAR THE EL AL OFFICE 
IN AMSTERDAM, CLAIMED BY ABU NIDAL (FATAH REVOLUTIONARY 
COUNCIL). 
 
-- ABU NIDAL BOMBED THE BRITISH AIR OFFICE IN ROME IN 
SEPTEMBER INJURING 15 PERSONS, MANY OF THEM PASSERSBY. 
 
-- BRITAIN ARRESTED TWO ABU NIDAL OPERATIVES IN SEPTEMBER 
WHO INTENDED TO ATTACK AN UNIDENTIFIED TARGET. 
-- ABU NIDAL MEMBERS THREW GRENADES AT ROME'S CAFE DE 
PARIS IN SEPTEMBER, INJURING 38 TOURISTS, AMONG THEM 
GERMANS, BRITONS, ITALIANS, ARGENTINIANS, BRAZILIANS AND 
AMERICANS. 
 
--  A JULY INCIDENT IN COPENHAGEN INVOLVING A SYNAGOGUE 
AND THE NORTHWEST ORIENT AIRLINES OFFICE, AND ONE IN 
AMSTERDAM ON SEPTEMBER 30 INVOLVING THE EL AL OFFICE HAVE 
NOT BEEN DIRECTLY TIED TO ANY GROUP, BUT THERE IS 
SUSPICION THAT ABU NIDAL WAS INVOLVED. 
 
-- THE GROUP BOMBED TWO HOTELS IN ATHENS, ONE IN 
SEPTEMBER WHICH INJURED 19 PERSONS, MOSTLY BRITISH, AND 
ONE IN AUGUST, WHICH INJURED 13 BRITISH. 
 
-- THE BOMBING OF TWO RESTAURANTS IN KUWAIT IN JULY, MOST 
PROBABLY BY ABU NIDAL, KILLED EIGHT PERSONS AND INJURING 
89 OTHERS. 
 
-- THE ATTACKS ON THE AIRLINE OFFICES IN MADRID KILLING 
ONE AND WOUNDING 24. 
 
-- THE ROCKET AGAINST A JORDANIAN AIRILNER IN APRIL. 
 
FUTURE TRENDS AND IMPLICATIONS: 
 
THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO 
CONCENTRATE ON JORDANIAN AND PRO-ARAFAT PLO TARGETS. 
EVEN IF THE SYRIANS FOR TACTICAL REASONS SHOULD CURTAIL 
THEIR SUPPORT OF THE ABU NIDAL GROUP'S OPERATIONS AGAINST 
JORDAN AND PRO-ARAFAT PLO, THE ACTIVITIES ARE LIKELY TO 
CONTINUE.  ABU NIDAL HIMSELF, UNDER DEATH SENTENCE BY THE 
PLO SINCE 1974 FOR PLOTTING AGAINST THE LIFE OF ARAFAT, 
AND THOSE UNDER HIM ARE CARRYING ON WHAT AMOUNTS TO A 
PERSONAL VENDETTA.  THE ADDITION OF LIBYAN SUPPORT 
PRESENTS AN EVEN BROADER THREAT, PARTICULARLY FOR WESTERN 
STATES.  QADHAFI'S PARANOIA AGAINST THE WEST AND ABU 
NIDAL'S EFFICIENCY COMPRISE A DEADLY COMBINATION. 
INCREASINGLY, HIGH CASUALTY ATTACKS AGAINST WESTERN 
TARGETS ARE LIKELY. 
 
IN THE LONGER RUN, THE ABU NIDAL GROUP, DUE TO ITS 
EXCELLENT ORGANIZATION, ACCESS TO FUNDS AND SUPPORT, MOST 
RECENTLY FROM LIBYA, AND DEDICATION TO TERRORISM, 
CONSTITUTES ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORIST GROUPS.  ITS WIDE-SPREAD NETWORK AND RUTHLESS 
DISREGARD FOR THE INTERESTS AND IDEOLOGICAL POSITIONS OF 
THE COUNTRIES, GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS IT STRIKES, MAKES 
IT A FORMIDABLE FOE.  ONLY THROUGH A COORDINATED EFFORT 
OF ALL THOSE COUNTRIES FOR WHICH IT POSES A POTENTIAL 
THREAT CAN THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION BE STOPPED.
