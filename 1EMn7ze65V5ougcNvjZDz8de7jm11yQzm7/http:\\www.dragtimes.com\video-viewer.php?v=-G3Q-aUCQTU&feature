Awesome CRASH TEST - BENZ Vs. Smart!
A Mercedes S-Class & a Smart ForTwo go head to head in this awesome Crash
Test, other then u would expect by looking at the video, the little Smart
comes out the of the test rather well, although u would probably still be
pretty much dead if u were in it crashing at that speed. i cut all the
German spoken, boring explaining out of it.. the sound is still a little
off, sorry for that but i couldn't be bothered with it anymore :P enjoy!
