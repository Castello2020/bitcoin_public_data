00:38:52 <jaimef> lispworks worth it? :P
00:39:16 <Xach> It's pretty good.
00:39:39 <pjb> Well, I hoped to use it as a solution to a McCLIM problem on MacOSX, but it seems it's only available on X11 and MS-Windows.
00:40:09 <pjb> Everytime I try to do something with Lispworks, that fails for some reason or another
00:41:46 <pjb> And CLIM in Allegro is thru X11 too, there's no native MacOSX CLIM it seems :-(

Mainly because Hunchentoot doesn't have a standard filter mechanism, nor does it have a user/login system (as per design, I guess). So right now it's just a single function that one has to call to perform the handshake

03:53:49 <Zhivago> GCL is a version of KCL that was mostly developed to support maxima.
03:54:02 <drmeister> Bike: That's an interesting statement - what does maxima need that GCL provides?
03:54:25 <Bike> i mean, the development of GCL and maxima got mixed up. apparenty to the detriment of both.
03:55:01 <drmeister> I was hoping to run maxima at some point and ditch mathematica althogether.
03:55:25 <Fare> what's NOT horrible about GCL?
03:55:49 <sykopomp> KCL was developed mostly in isolation, too, wasn't it?
03:56:04 <sykopomp> is that the one where randomly some japanese folks were like "hey look we have lisp"
03:56:18 <Fare> sykopomp, yup
03:56:22 <drmeister> ECL is derived from KCL isn't it?
03:56:36 <Fare> distantly, yes
03:57:22 <Fare> KCL -> { AKCL -> GCL , ECLS -> ECL }
03:57:34 <Fare> ECL -> MKCL
03:58:48 <Zhivago> ECLS came from ECL, didn't it?
04:01:00 <beach> Sorry for my ignorance, but if MKCL is an improvement over ECL (as the project page claims) is it really worth the effort to maintain ECL as well?

04:05:52 <Fare> JCB has some good ideas, but he sucks as a developer of an open source project
04:06:04 <beach> I see.
04:06:26 <Fare> what you CAN tell is that JCB has not been using source control, and not been releasing often, either, and not been tracking bugfixes in ECL since the fork.
04:06:56 <Fare> and yes, you can tell that from the project page
04:07:08 <beach> Fare: Thanks.
04:07:16 <beach> I guess I didn't look hard enough.
04:07:52 <Fare> so I haven't looked at the merit of his changes to ECL � I'm sure there are some � but as a fork it still sucks.
04:08:14 <beach> So it seems ECL would be well worth maintaining.
04:08:20 <Fare> would it?
04:08:33 <Fare> no one seems to agree enough.
04:08:40 <Fare> does CL have a future?

10:41:26 <p_l> hlavaty`: Windows uses LDAP, with (slightly extended) Kerberos v5 for authentication etc.
10:41:40 <p_l> hlavaty`: that's what is used for modern domains
10:43:52 <p_l> for HTTP authenticated with Kerberos, you'd need to write your own code to handle SPNEGO (iirc) or use some proxy to do it for you and just pass some variable informing you of auth status

10:46:00 <p_l> loke_: I have such giant smile right now it's threatening to break my face
10:47:16 <loke_> All you need to do to use it is to call (SPNEGO-AUTH fn) in the body of a hunchentoot handler. After successful handshake, the fn will be called with one argument, the name of the autoenticated user
10:47:40 <loke_> I.e. all normal processing needs to go in the "fn"
10:47:49 <hlavaty`> loke_: thank you!  i see that the main work is via in cl-gss, gss ffi wrapper
10:48:00 p_nathan [~Adium@216.57.209.252] has joined #lisp
10:48:02 <loke_> hlavaty`: Yes. I wrote that too. It's in Quicklisp
10:48:51 <pavelpenev> chr``: get-internal-real-time might do what you need, but it's implementation specific.  See http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_get_in.htm and http://xach.livejournal.com/94777.html . The SBCL docstring is:
10:48:51 <pavelpenev> "Return the real time (\"wallclock time\") since startup in the internal
10:48:51 <pavelpenev> time format. (See INTERNAL-TIME-UNITS-PER-SECOND.)"
10:49:02 <p_l> hlavaty`: well, it kind of has to be done - GSS API is for plugging in the SPNEGO negotiated auth mechanism
10:49:32 <loke_> Oh, one thing to keep in mind: if you have a windows client, it will initially request a mechnicasm that is unsupported, and CL-GSS:ACCEPT-SEC will throw an error. Just respond to that by throwing a 500 or wahetever, and Explorer will come back again with a "normal" GSSAPI request

10:50:31 <hlavaty`> i was hoping for pure lisp library, but ffi wrapper is still better than no solution
10:51:05 <loke_> hlavaty`: That would be insanely painful. You'd have to reimplement not only GSSAPI but also the entire Kerberos client part
10:51:29 <loke_> No one is going to do that in Lisp. They did it for Java, and the Java implementation is horrible to deal with
10:52:16 <p_l> and you can't load local GSS plugins without FFI anyway
10:52:19 <hlavaty`> ok

10:54:29 <hlavaty`> is there a good overview/spec for the gss protocol you could recommend?
10:54:32 <loke_> Oh, and don't forget to call CL-GSS:KRB5-REGISTER-ACCEPTOR-IDENTITY with your service keytab as well
10:54:40 <loke_> hlavaty`: The protocol itself?
10:54:45 <hlavaty`> yes
10:54:49 <loke_> hlavaty`: there is no GSS protocol
10:54:53 <loke_> it's an API
10:55:03 <loke_> There is a Kerberos protocol
10:55:07 <hlavaty`> well, the systems talk to each other somehow
10:55:20 <loke_> Yeah, using the underlying implementation. Normally Kerberos.
10:55:42 <hlavaty`> understand
10:56:19 <loke_> hlavaty`: STart here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4556

10:57:30 <loke_> have fun :-)
10:57:55 <p_l> hlavaty`: GSS is to provide pluggable authentication (a bit like PAM) for remote services, SPNEGO is basically a way to negotiate *what* you're using to authenticate
10:57:58 <loke_> I've spent several hours on getting the FFI bindings working satisfactory (and there are still issues with it)
10:58:02 <p_l> Kerberos is the actual auth protocol
10:58:11 <loke_> Implementing just that RFC will take months at least

11:03:15 <hlavaty`> loke_: i dont think pubkey cryptography is difficult in lisp; we have bignums out of the box; the difficult part is to wrap ones head around the ideas and then implement the overengineered wire protocols
11:03:34 <loke_> hlavaty`: Kerberos is not public key. It only uses symmetric keys.
11:03:53 <loke_> hlavaty`: That said, it's not the encryuption that is difficult (Ironclad already has everything you need)
11:04:12 <loke_> it's the implementation of the protocol itself that will have you go insane
11:04:16 <hlavaty`> yes, and i just found http://common-lisp.net/project/crypticl/

12:23:40 *hitecnologys* just thought that the previous phrase was probably incorrect.
12:24:33 <stassats> did you mean "damp"?
12:24:44 <hitecnologys> Yup.
12:25:03 <stassats> i'm pulling your leg, sorry
12:25:23 <hitecnologys> I probably need to sleep more, my mind is full of something weird.
12:26:46 <hitecnologys> The actual question was: anybody working on something interesting?
12:27:26 <stassats> why do you want to know?
12:27:36 <hitecnologys> Just curious.
12:27:40 <stassats> wouldn't you be rather working on something interesting yourself?
12:28:25 <hitecnologys> I'm already working on something interesting: that crappy online libraries engine of mine.
12:29:18 <hitecnologys> (or library engine, I'm not sure how to call it properly)

14:22:38 <hitecnologys> Let's say I have two macros. One does something like setting a value in hash table and another takes this value from it. The tricky part is that second macro can't do this because the part that sets this value are not yet evaluated. How can safely and properly make it be evaluated at compile time?

18:46:25 <jasom> I actually spent some time digging through the C standard, and you can make a strongly garbage collected C implementation that doesn't violate the C spec
18:46:42 -!- cruxeter1us is now known as cruxeternus
18:47:25 <jasom> since any access to an object by a non-character type defines the type of an object.
18:47:52 <jasom> so heterogenously using the results of a malloc is techincally undefined behavior
18:48:48 <Quadrescence> jasom, IIRC, the Symbolics implementation of C had free(3) as a no-op
18:48:58 <Quadrescence> but I may be misremembering
18:49:09 <jasom> and implementations are not required to provide conversions between integers and pointers (but if they do, it must be reversible assuming the integer is large enough)
18:49:50 <Tuxedo> Luckily, all the C code ever written is very strictly adherent to the spec.
18:51:04 <Quadrescence> hm, maybe you haven't written anything substantial then? ;)

18:52:01 <sellout-> Tuxedo / jasom: Yeah, actually, I was working on a platform with a system-wide GC and other scoped memory stuff that would allow a conforming C implementation (EG, with bounds-checking), but not a lot of the abused tricks that work elsewhere.
18:52:41 <sellout-> Never did actually get to write a C complier for it, though :/
18:55:14 <jasom> Didn't someone do a full C implementation in CL?

21:36:36 <jasom> dim: f you don't specify :save-runtime-options then you don't need to do anything to expose --dynamic-space-size
21:37:17 <dim> let's try that then, I don't know (yet) what buildapp is doing here
21:37:33 <jasom> dim: buildap uses :save-runtime-options
21:37:36 <dim> (COMMAND-LINE-ARGUMENTS::PROCESS-OPTION "dynamic-space-size" NIL NIL #<unavailable argument> NIL NIL)
21:37:49 <dim> and I'm managing the command line myself it seems
21:38:14 <dim> what would the the CL code to apply that option?
21:38:17 <jasom> dim: the way it works by default is the runtime options are still parsed by sbcl if you don't use :save-runtime-options in s-l-a-d
21:38:34 <jasom> dim: but your toplevel function has to parse all the toplevel options
21:38:36 nisstyre [~yours@oftn/member/Nisstyre] has joined #lisp
21:38:48 <jasom> if you do use :save-runtime-options in s-l-a-d then all options are treated as toplevel options
21:38:49 <dim> so you say that if I register the option it just happens?

21:39:34 <dim> anyway to change the value after the image is started?
21:40:23 <jasom> I don't think so; I would imagine it would be something like (setf (sb-ext:dynamic-space-size) ...) if you could but I think that's an error

21:55:36 <dim> in my usage of it, sorry
21:55:50 <Xach> ah
21:56:04 <dim> it was loading the quicklisp Postmodern rather than my locally hacked version (there's a bug I'm fixing there)
21:56:17 <dim> https://github.com/marijnh/Postmodern/issues/39 for the curious ;-)
21:56:42 <Xach> ah
21:56:45 <dim> Xach: would you be interested into buildapp exposing the --dynamic-space-size option in the produced binaries?
