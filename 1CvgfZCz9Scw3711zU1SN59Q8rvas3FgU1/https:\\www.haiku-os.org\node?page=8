Be aware that nightly images may be unstable. Additionally, some packages included with official releases need to be installed separately.

Package Management: New Contract Starts
Blog post by bonefish on Mon, 2013-06-03 20:13
package management, contract work My new contract has now officially started. At the moment it looks like its duration will be at least three months. A big thanks to everyone who donated to make that possible!

BIG contracts and a call to support HAIKU!
News posted on Mon, 2013-05-27 15:42
contracting, donations, haiku inc., hiring We are excited to finally share this news about development contracts!
We are going to be funding a minimum 800 hours of HAIKU development and with your help, many more hours!
And to help you preview the progress, there is a set of pre-built package management images available!
As you know, Ingo and Oliver have been working these past months on Haiku's package management for extremely low rates -- to the tune of €12.50 per hour.
It is a commendable and fortunate event to have developers who are able to devote large blocks of time in their schedules for such a meager pay scale.
This time, we are going to try new models for each of them, in order to secure even more dedicated development time.

Package Management: Building Things (Part 2)
Blog post by bonefish on Sat, 2013-05-25 19:29
package management, contract work It's been quite a while since the previous blog post. I've been waiting for an nice occasion, but the more interesting milestones are still a bit away. While nothing flashy can be presented, a lot of work has been done anyway.

Bitcoin now accepted! Blog post by mmadia on Sun, 2013-05-12 13:46
In a third installment of donation infrastructure updates, Bitcoin is now accepted! As you may know, bitcoin is a digital currency, which can be "mined" or traded online for cash and various goods and services. Donation buttons are listed on Haiku, Inc.'s donation page. For those who prefer, our bitcoin address is 1CvgfZCz9Scw3711zU1SN59Q8rvas3FgU1.

Flattery will get you everything.
Blog post by mmadia on Sat, 2013-05-11 23:59
Another development in Haiku's donation infrastructure has been implemented! This time it's Flattr - Social microdonations. Flattr is a way for you to set a monthly donation budget, which then automatically gets divided into equal pieces and donated to people you choose to "Flattr". You can read more about How Flattr Works. In time, we expect Flattr buttons to be added elsewhere, including haiku-files.org and even within individual postings on the website. For now, it's added underneath the piggy bank donation meter, which shows the yearly income from donations. We understand that no single donation processor will meet every person's wants or needs, so we are continuing to adopt multiple options.

Raising funds for Haiku through Goodsearch
Blog post by mmadia on Sat, 2013-05-11 17:10
donations, haiku inc. Last month on the [haiku-inc] mailing list, Arman "Kulluminatii" Chahal suggested adding Haiku to Goodsearch. "What is Goodsearch?", you may ask. It's a Yahoo! powered search engine that will donate money (about a penny) to your favorite non-profit or school. They provide other ways to help earn money -- shopping online, participating in online surveys, completing special offers and more! This past week, the registration process completed and Haiku is now a participating non profit!
To choose Haiku as your cause,
Go to goodsearch's homepage
Click the "Choose a cause" button
Enter "Haiku" in the search box.
Select "Haiku (Saddle Brook, NJ)"
Alternatively, you can simply bookmark http://www.goodsearch.com/?charityid=949749
Currently, WebPositive is hard-coded to use Google when performing a search query from the URL bar. Until a user-defined setting is implemented, the easiest way is simply to set goodsearch as the start page, navigate to it and perform your search.
To set WebPositive's homepage,
Go to Window and select Settings
Paste http://www.goodsearch.com/?charityid=949749 as the Start page and click Apply.
Overall, this is another way each of us can collectively chip in and help raise secure additional funding for HAIKU. Thank you for the suggestion, Kulluminatii!

Debugger: Overview of New Features
Blog post by anevilyak on Sat, 2013-04-27 23:16
arrays, debugger, reports, return values In the past few weeks, I've managed to find a bit more free time to work on Haiku. As per usual, the lion's share of this time was spent on improving our integrated debugger. As such, I thought I'd give a brief overview of what's been added, and how it can be useful.
