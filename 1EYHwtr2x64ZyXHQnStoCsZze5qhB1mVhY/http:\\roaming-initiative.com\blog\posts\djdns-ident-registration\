<p>I released a major DJDNS feature today, and while it&rsquo;s still a bit rough, it should be serviceable as a base for the next steps of decentralization. In case you haven&rsquo;t heard the news already, it&rsquo;s the ability to store EJTP Identities in the DJDNS registry, and retrieve them over a <a href="http://roaming-initiative.com:16232/">simple HTTP API</a>.</p>

<p>Normally this would feel like a big deal on its own (which it is) rather than just a stepping stone to the &ldquo;real stuff&rdquo;, but that&rsquo;s crunch time for ya.</p>

<h1 id="toc_0">What is it?</h1>

<p>When DJDNS is decentralized, it will use the EJTP Identity Format to store the cryptographic key information of the participants, and verify that a user&rsquo;s actions are their own. Authentication is extremely important. The question is, where do you store this information, so that everyone can retrieve Identity objects as they need?</p>

<p>The answer is - in the DJDNS registry itself! It&rsquo;s a perfect place to store arbitrary data associated with domains. And when you have an Identity name in email format, such as &ldquo;this@that.com&rdquo; (which is the Identity name convention)&hellip; well, hard to get more &ldquo;associated with domains&rdquo; than that. DJDNS can look up cryptographic identities in the same data (and mostly the same <em>way</em>) as it does IP addresses.</p>

<h1 id="toc_1">When will this be working?</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s working now! I&rsquo;ve had this up most of the day, I&rsquo;ve just been holding off on announcing it until it was a bit more documented, and the tooling was a bit smoothed out.</p>

<p><a href="http://roaming-initiative.com:16232/">http://roaming-initiative.com:16232/</a></p>

<h1 id="toc_2">How do I use it?</h1>

<h2 id="toc_3">Retrieving identities</h2>

<p>The API server will run on port 16232 on any DJDNS installation (port number will eventually be configurable). Since this is a very primitive API, with no transport security of its own, it is recommended to either run your own local DJDNS server to make your requests over localhost, or connect to a server over Hyperboria.</p>

<p>Eventually we will have native support for key signatures and/or transport security. For now, this is still kind of a hack to bootstrap the decentralized registry.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Storing identities</h2>

<p>There are 2 main steps to this. First you have to make an identity, then you have to store it in the registry.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Making an identity</h3>

<p>After installing the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/campadrenalin/EJTP-lib-python">EJTP</a> via git, run <code>ejtp-identity new-interactive</code> to create a new identity. It walks you through every step, trying to explain the purpose of each part. It&rsquo;s still a rough tool - trust me on this, you want a 1024bit RSA key - but at the end, you should have a cache file with your Identity in it.</p>

<p>Now, <strong>you don&rsquo;t want to publish your private key</strong>, so you need to make a public version to work with, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>ejtp-identity details -ep yourname@domain.com \
    --cache-source=&quot;/path/to/cache&quot; &gt; public.cache
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip;filling in your Identity name and cache file location accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Adding it to the registry</h3>

<p>Now that you have something to add to the registry, it&rsquo;s time to do so. Mostly, this is the same as any change to the registry - you edit your private page, submit the changes as a pull request to Github, and I pull the changes. The only potentially complicated bit is, <em>what changes am I making to my private page?</em></p>

<p>Look at <a href="https://github.com/campadrenalin/djdns-hype-flat/blob/master/private/ri.json">my page</a> or <a href="https://github.com/campadrenalin/python-djdns/blob/master/docs/IDENTITY_REGISTRATION.md">the documentation</a> for reference. You&rsquo;re adding the contents of your public cache file, to the branch with the matching domain, under the key &ldquo;users&rdquo;. <strong>IF YOUR IDENTITY NAME&rsquo;S DOMAIN DOES NOT MATCH THE BRANCH, YOUR IDENTITY WILL NOT BE ACCESSIBLE.</strong></p>

<p>While I refuse to make any adjustments on your behalf for this kind of thing (I don&rsquo;t want any question about whether I&rsquo;ve tampered with the crypto data), I&rsquo;ll definitely help you make sure your page is set up right, verify that your identities are accessible, etc.</p>

<p>When it&rsquo;s merged, I&rsquo;ll give you a link in the github comments, to the API URL where people can download your public identity data. It&rsquo;s pretty easy for you to figure out on your own, but why not get straight to the celebrating and the reassurance of &ldquo;oh god it works&rdquo;?</p>

<h1 id="toc_7">What did it take to make this work?</h1>

<ul>
<li>Add my own identity as a demo</li>
<li>Traversal support in DJDNS</li>
<li>HTTP API server in DJDNS</li>
<li>EJTP new-interactive wizard</li>
<li>What feels like <a href="https://github.com/campadrenalin/python-djdns/blob/master/docs/IDENTITY_REGISTRATION.md">lots</a> <a href="https://github.com/campadrenalin/python-djdns/blob/master/docs/EXTENSIBILITY.md">of</a> <a href="http://roaming-initiative.com:16232/">documentation</a>, but probably still isn&rsquo;t enough.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="toc_8">What&rsquo;s next?</h1>

<p>Next, I have to clean up the DEJE protocol into some sort of working state again. I kind of made a mess with a halfway-done protocol refactor, which I&rsquo;ll have to cut short by either aborting the refactor for now entirely, or hurrying to finish it. I&rsquo;m not totally decided which yet.</p>

<p>Then, it&rsquo;s a matter of setting up HTTP bootstrap to download initial, verifiable copies of DJDNS pages, which we can then sync-to-current-version over the DEJE protocol thanks to easy access to EJTP identities.</p>
