	<h2>What is RSS and how is it useful to me ?</h2>
	<div class="box padding">
		RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication.  What it does is create an automated listing of updates from a web site, called a "feed".
		Each entry in a feed is a separate individual torrent - the same torrent you'd get by opening the download link manually on a torrent
		listing web page.<br />
		The feed is written in structured XML which means (without going into too much detail) that the listing is in a format that's very
		easy for other applications to understand and act upon without further human intervention. In our case this means we can automate the
		downloading of torrents as they become available.

<div class="block">

	<h2>How do I get an RSS feed ?</h2>
	<div class="box padding">
		This varies from website to website, but they come in two basic flavours : `Complete` and `Customised`<br />
		Complete is a full listing of every torrent that appears on the site in question.<br />
		Customised allows you to narrow down the torrents that appear in the feed according to different criteria.<br />
		Each type has benefits and downsides : a feed from a Complete type site tends to offer a much wider range of TV shows, but you have to
		put more effort into creating filters in your torrent client to narrow down the listing so that you only end up downloading the shows you want.<br />
		A feed from a Customised site tends to have fewer shows, but allows you to personalise your feed content, so that it does the bulk of the
		filtering out of unwanted shows/episodes for you automatically.

	<h2>How do I use the RSS feed in my client ?</h2>
	<div class="box padding">
		<b>Azureus</b><br />
		<br />
		We do not update this anymore as we feel that uTorrent is the client to use. The old version can be found
		<a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=dgsf923m_12z5bjsgs">here</a><br />
		<br />
		<b>&#181;Torrent - <span style="color: red;">make sure you update to version 1.8! One of the many benefits is automatic re-download of propers, repacks, etc!</span></b><br />

			<li>
				Click on the <i>RSS</i> icon in the toolbar<br />
				<br />
				<img style="width: 464px; height: 255px;" src="http://docs.google.com/File?id=dgsf923m_2hb9np8gj_b"><br />
				<br />
				Or select from the menu as shown below:<br />
				<br />
				<img style="width: 407px; height: 239px;" src="http://docs.google.com/File?id=dgsf923m_3f8fgt5gs_b"><br />
				<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Fill the dialog as below and click OK:<br />
				<br />
				<img style="width: 393px; height: 290px;" src="http://docs.google.com/File?id=dgsf923m_4ckwqnn9w_b"><br />
				<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				With custom alias you can name your feed as you want it to be shown in the sidebar feed list.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Do not change the Subscription option unless you want <b>each and every</b> item published in the feed to be downloaded automatically.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Afterwards
				your feed(s) will appear on the sidebar where you can edit etc... by
				right clicking on them. Also the color will indicate various status
				like active and working (orange), not working (red) etc... and clicking
				on it you will get the list of the actual feed content (the show
				torrents in our case).<br />
				<br />
				<img style="width: 521px; height: 303px;" src="http://docs.google.com/File?id=dgsf923m_6fmw9k5hs_b"><br />
				<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				If you want to increase your chances to get your show in case of a problem
				like one of the feed is down or if the show is not properly placed in
				the feed, you can add more than one RSS Feed the same way you added the
				first one. Two examples are:<br />
				<br />
				EZRSS - EZTV : <a title="http://ezrss.it/feed/" href="http://ezrss.it/feed/">http://ezrss.it/feed/</a><br />
				<br />
				BT-CHAT - EZTV: <a href="http://rss.bt-chat.com/?group=3">http://rss.bt-chat.com/?group=3</a><br />
				<br />
				Each site offers various slightly different feed options - choose the one that best fits your needs.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Click Ctrl+R.&nbsp; Or choose from the menu bar as below. Here we create filters to act upon the feed.&nbsp;
				<u>One for each show you want to grab.</u><br />
				<br />
				<img style="width: 251px; height: 273px;" src="http://docs.google.com/File?id=dgsf923m_7gjgs3qf7_b">
				<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				This is the dialog where you will do this:<br />
				<br />
				<img style="width: 648px; height: 378.22px;" src="http://docs.google.com/File?id=dgsf923m_8fvgf6vc7_b"><br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Click on <i>Add</i> button, and in the left hand sub-pane rename <i>New Filter</i> to whatever you want e.g. <b>Lost.</b><br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Because
				&#181;Torrent doesn't have the ability to set a Fail filter we don't need to
				create a single primary Exclusions filter, but have to add exclusions
				to each individual show filter.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Now we can fill out the <i>Filter Settings</i> sub-pane on the right.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				On the <i>Filter</i> line we add the keywords that
				will match with the specific show from the feed.&nbsp; For EZTV this can be
				quite a simple term, as it's already personalised, so you don't have to
				filter out lots of rubbish from 3rd party uploaders.&nbsp; Capitalisation is
				not important - upper &amp; lower case are treated the same.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				For shows with simple, consistent names we only need one or two word expressions e.g. <b>lost</b> or <b>desperate
				housewives</b><br />
				<br />
				<font color="#ff0000">If you are having trouble getting the show try the following (for example): <b>desperate?housewives*</b></font><br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				&#181;Torrent contains pretty good inbuilt algorithms
				for determining show name/video type/episode number, so we don't need
				to use strict regular expression syntax in most cases i.e. no need to
				replace spaces with <b>.</b> or use excessively fiddly expressions to deal with punctuation or short initials in show names.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				If the name is too ambiguous or variable then we do need to be a little more careful e.g. ER or CSI/Miami/New York.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				For ER we need to make sure it matches the various possible titles. Use the <i>Filter</i> <b>ER|E.R.</b><br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				For each of the CSI shows we need to exclude the two others i.e. keep CSI, reject CSI:Miami and CSI:New York.<br />
				For original CSI on the <i>Filter</i> line use <b>CSI</b>&nbsp; &amp; on the <i>Not</i> line use <b>*Miami*|*York*|*NY*</b><br />
				For CSI Miami on the <i>Filter</i> line use <b>CSI Miami</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; No need for a specific <i>Not</i> entry.<br />
				
				For CSI New York on the <i>Filter</i> line use <b>CSI New York|CSI NY</b>&nbsp; No need for a specific <i>Not</i> entry.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				For shows like The Daily Show or The Colbert Report with dates rather than regular episode numbers use <b>The Daily Show*</b>
				on the <i>Filter</i> line and see <i>Smart Ep. Filter</i> remarks below.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Because of the lack of a global Fail filter we need to add the file types we want to ignore <u>on each filter's <i>Not</i>
				line&nbsp;</u>e.g. <b>*AC3*|*HR*|*264*|*720*</b>&nbsp; Add any terms you like here.&nbsp; Just surround each one with <b>*</b>
				wild cards and separate them with a <b>|</b><br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Once you have the filter working to your satisfaction then complete the rest of the options.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Set a <i>Save In</i> directory if you want one. <br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Set the <i>Feed</i> to be filtered as a specific one i.e. EZTV, or just All<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				You can use The <i>Quality</i> filter for picking up the version you want, or set it to ALL, and let the previous <i>Not</i>
				entries take care of it.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				For episodes with regular numbers i.e. 2x05 or S02E05, enter
				an episode to start from i.e. 2x05 or a range, for the series i.e.
				2x5-22 and check the box, or leave it blank if you want to start from
				the next new episode.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Uncheck <i>Filter Matches Original Name Instead of Decoded</i>.&nbsp; EZTV already standardises the names to a format the internal
				decoder readily copes with, so it's not needed.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Check <i>Give Download Highest Priority</i> if you want new episodes to leapfrog your existing queue.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				For episodes with regular numbers i.e. 2x05 or S02E05, check <i>Smart Ep. Filter</i>
				- this ensures that the client remembers the most recent episode
				number, and won't download an older one even if it appears as a new
				entry in the feed.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				For shows like The Daily Show with dates rather than regular numbering make sure <i>Smart Ep. Filter</i> is <u>unchecked</u>,
				so it will just download the most recent one in the feed.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Leave <i>Minimum Interval</i> as Match Always.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Set a <i>Label</i> for new episodes if you want one.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				All changes are automatically saved as you make them, so you don't have to do anything once you're done editing.<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Repeat steps for as many shows as you need.&nbsp; Job done.
