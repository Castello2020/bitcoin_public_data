      <h3>Lucky Bit is provably fair!</h3>

<p>This is how it works:</p>

<ol>
   <li>The key that LuckyBit uses to determine the "<em>lucky moves</em>" of a bet, and thus the winning amount,
      is changed every day;</li>
   <li>The key of a given day is made public after midnight of the next day;</li>
   <li>The respective hashes of all keys, past and future, <a href="/secret-key-hashes.txt">have been
      published</a> and prove that LuckyBit uses the correct key for each day;</li>
   <li>Nobody can modify this file, as its hash is recorded in the blockchain
      as of 10th of September, 2013;</li>
   <li>You can verify each bet in the <a href="/browse" target="_blank">bet browser</a>, which is
      also accessible at the bottom of the main page.
</ol>
<br>

<h3>Need more technical details?</h3>
<ul>

   <li>
      Your <em>lucky moves</em> are determined using a hash of the following string: <br>
      <pre class="inline">&lt;tx_id&gt;:&lt;vout_id&gt;:&lt;secret_key&gt;</pre>, where:

      <ul>
         <li><pre class="inline">&lt;tx_id&gt;</pre> is the transaction id of your bet as assigned by your wallet.
            (This data is controlled by you.)</li>
         <li><pre class="inline">&lt;vout_id&gt;</pre> is the rank of the output of your bet within the transaction's
            list of outputs. (Rank starts at 0 and is controlled by you.)
            This produces different lucky moves for each bet if you play several bets
            within a single transaction.</li>
         <li><pre class="inline">&lt;secret_key&gt;</pre> is the secret key of the day. It is unknown to you
            at the time of playing, but the hashes of all keys have been are published in advance, so nobody can
            modify these keys. The day of your bet is determined by the moment LuckyBit receives your bet's
            transaction. (Typically 1 to 10 seconds after you sent it.)</li>
      </ul>
   </li>

   <li>
      From the hash of <pre class="inline">&lt;tx_id&gt;:&lt;vout_id&gt;:&lt;secret_key&gt;</pre>, LuckyBit takes the
      binary representation of the last 4 bytes and read it from the left side. The bits determine
      your <em>lucky moves</em>: A <pre class="inline">1</pre>
      translates to a right move, a <pre class="inline">0</pre> to a left move. For instance, if the hexadecimal
      hash ends with <pre class="inline">ffff</pre>, your coin would always go right
      as the binary string would contain sixteen <pre class="inline">1</pre> and no <pre class="inline">0</pre>
   </li>

   <li>
      You can easily verify that your <em>lucky moves</em> were correct by computing the hash of the string
      <pre class="inline">&lt;tx_id&gt;:&lt;vout_id&gt;:&lt;secret_key&gt;</pre> of your bet.
      There are many websites that allow you to do this, for example:
      <ul>
         <li><a href="http://www.convertstring.com/en/Hash/SHA256" target="_blank">http://www.convertstring.com/en/Hash/SHA256</a></li>
         <li><a href="http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator" target="_blank">http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator</a></li>
      </ul>
   </li>

   <li>
      The key of each day is made public after midnight (UTC). LuckyBit can prove that nobody changed this key afterwards
      because the hashes of all keys, past and future, have been published in this file:
      <a href="/secret-key-hashes.txt">http://luckyb.it/secret-key-hashes.txt</a>
   </li>

   <li>The file that contains all key hashes has itself the following hash:
      <pre>e45fb03ae911b267615bc923803bc553adb0e3dd6c9e47c939073f30ec912a63</pre>
      You can compute the hash of this file as follows (on Linux/Mac):
      <pre>curl -s http://luckyb.it/secret-key-hashes.txt | shasum -a 256 -t</pre>
   </li>

   <li>Using the hash of this file as a bitcoin private key, it produces the
      following bitcoin address: <pre class="inline">1L85BxKU6J169kM934PQyV52maHmE86cFc</pre>. We have sent a transaction to
      this address on the 10/09/2013 (included in block 257126). You can verify this on
      <a href="http://blockchain.info/tx/63a07090dad72b05844f07275833e73d400cb3e739c3af72449c1210dff0bd40" target="_blank">blockchain.info</a>
   </li>

   <li>Note: All hashes are SHA-256 (text mode).</li>

</ul>

      <h3>How to play?</h3>
<p>
   <strong>Note on wallets:</strong> Please make sure you use a
   <a data-dismiss="modal" data-target="#aboutModal" onclick="website.windowWalletsWarning();" href="#">compatible wallet.</a>
</p>

<h4>Playing is easy!</h4>
<p>
   To play, simply send the desired amount to one of the three LuckyBit game addresses!
</p>

<h4>Available games</h4>
<p>
   LuckyBit features 3 different games:
</p>

<ol>
   <li><strong>Green</strong> (little risk): small probability to lose, but also small winnings;</li>
   <li><strong>Yellow</strong> (medium risk): medium probability to lose, but higher winnings;</li>
   <li><strong>Red</strong> (high risk): highest probability to lose, but also the highest winnings.</li>
</ol>

<div style="margin: 30px 0 30px 50px">
   <img src="../img/howto_addresses.jpg"/>
</div>

<ol>
   <li>
      To play, copy the address into your wallet, using either the clipboard button or scan the QR code:
      <ul class="arrowList">
         <li>you can find the addresses of the games next to the game bars</li>
         <li>all addresses start with <pre class="inline">1Lucky</pre> followed by a letter indicating the game color</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
      Next, select the amount you want to play. For your bet to be valid,
      <ul class="arrowList">
         <li>the amount that you send must be at least equal to the <em>minimum</em> amount...</li>
         <li>...and at most equal to the <em>maximum</em> amount of the game you are playing</li>
         <li>you can find the minimum and maximum amounts next to the game bars</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
      That's it, wait for your bet to appear at the top of the game area!
   </li>
</ol>
<br>

<h4>Valid bets</h4>

<p>
   Your bet is valid if it respects the minimum and maximum limits of the game. Few seconds after
   you have sent your bet from your wallet, you will see your coin falling out of the pipe at the top of
   the LuckyBit game area. The color of the coin will match the game you have selected.
   The coin will follow a (provably fair) random path through the game area
   until it falls into one of the multipliers of its corresponding game.
</p>

<p>
   LuckyBit immediately sends back to you your initial amount multiplied by the multiplier that
   your coin attained. When your bet initially goes out of the LuckyBit pipe, a new line is added on top
   of the table on the front page and shows some information for
   your bet.
   You can also verify all relevant information for every past bets in the
   <a href="/browse" target="_blank">bet browser</a> (always accessible
   at the bottom of the front page).
</p>

<h4>Invalid bets</h4>

<p>
   Bets might be invalid because the amount is too small or too large, according to the limits of the
   game that you selected. If a bet is invalid, LuckyBut simply returns the bet to you immediately.
   Your invalid bet will not be visible in the game area, but you can see it in the
   <a href="/browse" target="_blank">bet browser</a>.
</p>


<h4>Good to know</h4>
<ul>
   <li>You can highlight your own bets by entering your bitcoin address into the box located at
      the top-right of the game area. If you do so, a special sound will indicate bets that come from your

<h3>Some more technical details</h3>

<h4>Transaction fees</h4>
<p>
   For every payout that LuckyBit sends, a standard fee is given to reward miners. This fee is currently 0.0001฿.
   Some transactions might require a higher fee, in which case anything above 0.0001฿ is entirely paid
   by LuckyBit.
</p>

<h4>Very large wins</h4>
<p>
   Very large wins might require a manual intervention to pay out. In this case, the operators of LuckyBit
   will be notified automatically and the payout will be done in a matter of hours.
   Note that LuckyBit <strong>always</strong> holds enough coins to pay
   the maximum possible earning that players can win, several times.
</p>

<h4>Suspicious transactions</h4>
<p>
   LuckyBit reserves the right to delay bets whose transactions
   are "suspicious" (based on a proprietary algorithm). 
   This delay can extend up to few minutes (maximum one block confirmation anyway).

      <h3>Frequently Ask Questions</h3>

<br>
<br>
<h4>How can I check if my bet was processed by LuckyBit?</h4>
<p>
Go to the <a href="/browse" target="_blank">Bet Browser</a>, and copy the transaction ID of your bet in the search field.
</p>


<h4>Why my bet does not show up immediately on LuckyBit?</h4>
<p>
In case of a non-standard transaction, LuckyBit waits for one confirmation before processing your bet.
Most likely the fee of your transaction is too small. Another (more rare) case is that one output is smaller than 5460 satoshis. <br>
Both cases are visible by hovering the small triangle warning on the "Estimation Confirmation Time" on <i>blockchain.info</i> with your mouse. <br>
As soon as your transaction confirms, your bet will appear, just be patient! 
</p>

<h4>My payout link says "Transaction not found" on blockchain.info?</h4>
<p>
If the little cube is visible next to your payout, the payment was sent! <br>
It is only that <i>blockchain.info</i> sometimes does not show unconfirmed transactions with unconfirmed inputs, so just wait for the next block to confirm your payout and it will magically get visible.</p>


<h4>I got a nice win, but did not receive my payout immediately as usual.</h4>
<p>
Congratulations! :)
We need to refill the hot wallet, we are notified when this need to be done.
You can expect to get your payout within 12 hours. 
</p>


<h4>Are you going to implement on off-chain version, like primedice and co?</h4>
<p>Yes, we will.</p>


<h4>Why is this page taking so much CPU?</h4>
<p>
It is the price to pay for fancy javascript animations. We are working on improvements!

      <h3>Your odds in LuckyBit</h3>
<p>
   The odds for our games are a weighted sum over all multipliers of their numerical value multiplied by
   the probability to fall into them.<br>
</p>
<p>
   <strong>The multipliers values are such that your odds are higher than
   98.24% for each game, this is better than satoshidice!</strong><br><br>
   You can also hover the multipliers with your mouse to get more information, among other things you will see the probability to fall into them.
</p>


<p>
   For your convenience, this is the probability <strong>B</strong>
   for a coin to arrive at the <strong>k</strong>'s multiplier, counted from the left:

<h3>The origins of LuckyBit</h3>
<p>
   The type of game used by LuckyBit is quite old. It is commonly called a "<em>bean machine</em>" or a
   "<em>Galton box</em>" after Sir Francis Galton, who was the first to describe the game in one of his books. A more
   recent incarnation of Galton's box was "<em>Plinko</em>", a popular game on the TV-show "<em>The price is right</em>".

      <h3>Note on wallets</h3>
<p>
   <strong>You must use only compatible wallets to play LuckyBit.</strong>
</p>

<p>
   Compatible wallets are wallets that allow you to receive bitcoin from the address(es) you sent from.
   This is not the case with online wallets that use a single bitcoin address for several users.
</p>

<ul>
   <li>Examples of <b>compatible</b> wallets:
      <ul>
         <li>Blockchain.info</li>
         <li>Bitcoin-Qt/Bitcoind</li>
         <li>Armory</li>
         <li>Electrum</li>
         <li>Multibit</li>
         <li>Android bitcoin wallet</li>
      </ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
   <li>Examples of wallets that are <b>not</b> compatible:
      <ul>
         <li>Exchanges such as MtGox, Bitstamp, Coinbase, etc.</li>
         <li>Shared wallets of other gambling sites</li>
         <li>Online wallets that send from a common address for all users</li>
         <li>In general, any service that uses a shared wallet for all its users</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ul>

<p>
   If you're not sure if your wallet is compatible, test it by sending a bet with
   the <strong>minimum amount</strong> to one of our games and see if
   you get something in return.
