It's 2015 and the New World Order is upon us. Fight with the Illuminati or Anarchist. Will you choose to dominate the world or save it by ending the Fed?! Expand Full Description & Credits
File Instructions:
Updated 1/3/2014 : Added Hijack a Plane ability to NWO, which allows you to crash a plane into the Anarchist (or your own side -- we're investigating False Flag ability with this or another unit).
We are aware the mod no longer works online (like most other mods since the Steam update). Considering mod's that have been green lit still haven't fixed it, I don't think it will be anytime soon, sorry. Instead we're trying to get the AI working so the mod can be enjoyed in a single player Skirmish (more so than now).
--------------------------------------------------------
We got as far as we could with this before we ran out of time. It's been sitting here for months and we both decided we'd never be able to take it any further due to our schedules. We hope one day in the future we can add more to this mod, but in case we don't ... feel free to do with it what you will.
Many thanks to all the people we copied and learned from along the way, your information was most valuable. If we missed crediting anyone for anything we added to the mod, we apologize. We did the best we could to keep up with what was added along with way and who originally created it.
Please keep in mind, we had no idea what we were doing going in, but we love CoH and decided it was missing a mod like this one. We learned as much as we could off the forums in a short time and dug in. Most of the artwork, uniforms, icons we created were supposed to be temporary placeholders ... however, for temps they're pretty good if we say so ourselves.
We balance tested as best we could. There was so much more planned. Maybe one day.
