		<h3>preamble..</h3>
		Initially I had no idea how or why I got myself invited into this "******* Magick Group", then I saw the request for essays on Karma. Hmm.. interesting, was my thought. While I haven't had any spare time this last week, today I managed to catch up on all those digested emails. *phew* Anyway, now I <strong>completely</strong> understand why I was invited!<br />
		<br />

		I will now explain Karma Yoga..<br />
		<br />

		<h3>Karma Yoga</h3>
		This has been an area of intense study and experiment for me, not so much in the traditional scholarly sense, those methods are rarely used here, but in the personal sense, as if understanding of the Laws of Karma and its mechanics were somehow vital to me, fundamental to my existance. That is also a general effect of this time we live in.<br />
		<br />

		Like everyone bound to earth, my knowledge is limited, filtered, yet I have discovered many things which may be useful to your understanding. As much as I am allowed to share, I will expand some of these discoveries. I say "discoveries" because there is nothing very new to learn here, it was all worked out long ago. We may have been mapping out this territory, attempting an understanding of it for as long as man could consider such things, but the essential truth remains unchanged. Only its presentation differs, and in that process, an evolution of our understanding of Karmic Law is taking place. You <strong>can</strong> know more than your forefathers did. That is the way.<br />
		<br />

		What I present here is no more than a brief sketch, foods for thoughts, some juicy seeds and a couple of tricks too. Read some bits slowly. Karma is, well..<br />
		<br />

		The common conception is a nonsense, obviously, but a clever one, and surely does provide a little of the essence of Karma Yoga to the popular tastes; that the laws of cause and effect also work outside the realm of the purely mechanical, and most folks are content to believe that if they do "bad" stuff, then they will attract bad events. They also believe that doing good stuff will be rewarding, bring "good" events, stuff. People really do (want to) believe that they are punished by Karma. Like Karma Cares!<br />
		<br />

		This is all very childlike, of course, and if these people refuse to look further into the issue, is that our concern? Perhaps they <em>might</em> do that, if someone would only explain it to them in a way that makes sense, someone who knew what they were talking about. Truth is, most people <em>need</em> to work with the concept at this childlike level for a very long time before even the slightest glimmer of real understanding comes. But it does come. In the meantime they try to behave.<br />
		<br />

		For the interested, the usual texts are littered with references to Karma, some very precise and enlightening, others much less so. So much misleading garbage on the subject exists that "writing about Karma" is very nearly a pointless task, literally. But the laws of Karma are well expounded in the work of every era and at every time, even today. Our current artistic output is literally creaking with examples. I decide here and now to make no references whatsoever! This piece will function as well as any. So, what is Karma?<br />
		<br />

		<h4>Karma is a lie.</h4>
		You'd better believe it!<br />
		<br />

		<h4>Karma is an energy.</h4>
		A force. At many levels of truth this tests positive. Trying to separate it out and examine it apart from the other forces at work in our life and universe is, for most, a subjective experience. We can discuss many of the effects of Karmic Law and much more, but its inner mechanics remain a mystery. Trying to plot an "individual's" karmic patterns is almost ridiculous. No man can trace a "line of cause-and-effect", there is no such thing. No one typing at a computer keyboard can fully grasp its reality, though he may be working very well along its lines, perhaps unwittingly. It doesn't matter, we don't need to understand its inner workings, in the same way that you do not need to understand C++ to start your web browser. Although if the Law of Attraction was in your ken, you'd be better equipped to decipher all Karmic patterns, and much more besides.<br />
		<br />

		But we don't even need to know <em>that</em> to "do" karma yoga.<br />
		Okay, what <strong>do</strong> we need to know?<br />
		<br />

		<h4>Karma is a Law.</h4>
		Its mechanics were set in motion at the birth of our universe, no intervention is necessary. You cannot alter Karmic Law, stop trying. People get confused with their childlike notions of "sin" and "God", with "good" and "bad" , forgetting that this universe is governed by a set of definite Laws. Not some guy on a cloud. People wouldn't mess with Gravity like that, they just accept it, understand it, and then learn to work with it. In that order.<br />
		<br />

		Is making aeroplanes defying gravity?<br />
		<br />

		<h4>Karma Works, Perfectly</h4>
		It never fails. Ever. There is no such thing as "Good Karma" in the same way as there's no such thing as "good electricity", you could power life-support machines, or make Pop-Tarts, it's all the same stuff. That's as far as that analogy goes. You get what you need.<br />
		<br />

		<h4>Karma is INSTANT.</h4>
		It doesn't feck around. It's NOW. No one is blindly "paying for past wrongs" there is no such thing, grow up! Consider, it will be some time until you read this text, but for you it's RIGHT NOW!, and for me too! And further, it was created the very instant you requested it (oh yes you did). I just got round to writing it out just now, I've been very busy. Effects may take time to materialise in the physical world, yes, but the material world is only a small part of the picture, as you know. The cart follows the cow, to see all consequences of an action is Karmic mastery, or at least, mastery of Karmic seeing.<br />
		<br />

		<h4>It <em>really</em> Works.</h4>
		That is, at all times and in all places. For earthlings there is no "escape" from Karma in the same way as there is no escape from air. If you have lungs, you need air, very simple. If you are human, you need Karma. If you believe that someday soon you will suddenly be "released" from the wheel of cause and effect, you are mistaken, again. Comfort yourself with "Ignorance is a necessary prerequisite to knowledge", that's presuming that you can accept how wildly inaccurate your current Karmic Fantasies really are.<br />
		<br />

		<h4>It's "Everywhere"</h4>
		If you know what you are looking for you cannot fail to see the operations of Karmic Law working around you, in every event, from the smallest to the largest, from that blue feather blowing in the wind, to sky-scrapers smashing to the ground, all is within the framework of Karmic operation, every particle spins with Karma.<br />
		<br />

		<h4>You can Work with Karma</h4>
		Yes I know I said that you couldn't escape it, that doesn't mean you can't work with it, even work outside it, but that would take more practice and dedication than most folks are willing to provide. Fortunately, that's not necessary either, all one needs to do is work "with" Karma.<br />
		<br />

		..unless you are lucky.<br />
		<br />

		This is where we need to stop and take a breath. Then ask ourselves the big question-<br />
		<br />

		<h4>Do I believe in Luck?</h4>
		Take a minute with this one. Believing in luck and understanding Karmic Law aren't compatible, not in the same brain. You'll need to dump one. <br />
		<br />

		Okay, time for a pocket-description of Karma, (ten pages already and <em>now</em> he gives us the pocket description! ha! nothing's for nothin!) or as I like to call it, "Karmic Law"..<br />
		<br />

		<strong>Karmic Law is a universal principle operating to create ideal circumstances.</strong><br />
		<br />

		It's outside the scope of this piece, to delve into what those circumstances might be for any particular individual, or even what I mean by any of those words, because the topic here is "Karma Yoga" and so it's time for another pocket description..<br />
		<br />

		<em>"Karma", coming from the Sankrist word "Kri", means "to do", or "to act". "Yoga" is from "Yeug", meaning "a yoke", "To join";  "Union". "Karma Yoga" therefore means..</em><br />
		<br />


		<h1>to act in union</h1><br />

		You won't read a better description than that.<br />
		<br />

		In union with what? you might ask. At the most simplistic level we might say "With the Higher Will" and sure, many would attest to being "guided" into action, or paths of action along these lines. To the Yogi this is a satisfying response, and he would argue that this is the path of least resistance for the soul, offering swiftest results, and easiest progress. "Why not?"<br />
		<br />

		<h4>Or are we magus?</h4>
		This is all very well and good, and by all definitions, the individual who work's for works sake, is joyful in that work, sees himself a cog in the great machinery, seeks no reward, is attached to nothing and no one, yet gives love unending, etc, would be pretty well kitted out as a Trainee Karma Yogi. If he could add "joyfully guided" to his toolkit he'd be yogi bear status within weeks! but..<br />
		<br />

		<h4>ARE WE MAGUS?</h4>
		My own work in the field is concerned with what I have come to refer as "bending karma". With my pocket descriptions past, I can begin to share a little of the good stuff.<br />
		<br />

		It began with a simple question; "What if the laws of Karma, impartial as they are, could somehow be bent to one's own will? What if one's own Karma, and that of those around you, could be altered to one's own design?"<br />
		<br />

		A few lines from now I'll hit you with a small but very cute phrase. If you've followed me down to here then it might just make perfect sense. If you still haven't grasped the whole Karma=MC<sup>2</sup> thing, then you'll need to work some first.<br />
		<br />

		Do you believe you are being punished for past sins? If so, do begin again at the top of the page!  Do you believe that if you are a "good" person, you will be rewarded for this goodness? Please.. Line One! Do you still blame her for that? See above! Do you believe everything I've said you say? .. try again!<br />
		<br />

		You must accept that every single event in your life until this point has been for YOU! Perfect! Every word you've read, or heard, or even overheard, was FOR you? You see that? Do you see how the only thing which makes you angry is YOU DAMMIT!? Good, let's goan..<br />
		<br />

		I realized that Karmic Law never fails, that it could be the constant in any equation I chose to create. <strong>Karmic Law = <em>exactly what you need</em></strong>, so my initial experiments focused on a very simple tactic..<br />
		<br />

		<h4>Change what I need.</h4>
		This is a mindblowingly uncomplicated concept, yet, tremendously difficult for most adepts to at first understand, and even more difficult to implement wholeheartedly, simply because,<br />
		<br />

		a)  they don't yet know what it is they need (apart from a good kick up the arse) In other words, they don't "know themselves", or aren't "self-realized" or whatever your pet-phrase for this is, "got yoga" maybe? Perhaps their single-minded ambition and endless hunger is leaps and bounds for that soul, or another's listless vanity and dilettante occultist meanderings <em>are</em> in line with their evolution, maybe not, who can say? Can you?<br />
		<br />

		The point is, no one can work out an equation until they at least know <em>one</em> part of it! Might be best just to go with the flow for a while, watch how Karma works (start with small "events"); you may begin to recognise patterns, maybe you can read karmic data naturally(!), like the matrix, and just maybe you'll get some opportunities to work out that dreadful mess.<br />
		<br />

		and..<br />
		<br />

		b) Actually, I've forgotten what b) was going to be. Insert your own damned excuse!<br />
		<br />
		In short, it's gonna take a lot of work before you can understand karma yoga, because you'll first have to DO Karma yoga! If you would simply detach yourself from your actions, and their imagined results, you might truly experience the effects of Karmic Law working in a controlled, scientific manner (which your western brain MUST have, before it accepts the truth, yes?), and then even more work before you can start to experiment with the interwoven cause-and-effect mechanisms (let's call these babies "Karmix") not to mention your trials with the dynamics of the Law of Attraction.<br />
		<h3>Attraction</h3>
		Of course, you may find yourself in contact with a master who can quickly impart some reality into your sleepy brain cells.<br />
		<br />

		Maybe <em>then</em> you can start to bend karma.<br />
		<br />

		syat!<br />
		for now..<br />
		<br />

		;o) Cor<br />
		<br />

		ps.. As an afterthought, I feel I should mention that my dog is called "Karma". But that means nothing.<br />
		<br />

		<hr class="cb-hr" /><br />
		<br />

		Right after I finished this I had the urge to pen this small piece, as it was so close <em>in time</em>, I guess it must be for you too...<br />
		<br />
		<br />

		<h4>cancer eater</h4>
		<br />

		Cancer's a great teacher, sure, but there's better ones.<br />
		Aye, for every unborn soul that chose a dis-eased life,<br />
		there's millions creating a new one here on earth.<br />
		Watch them go about their work, spreading their cancers,<br />
		crafting a comfy chair from fear, and hating it. Really watch them.<br />
		<br />

		They seem upset, unbalanced, does it show yet?<br />
		catch it now, before it works down, the physical, oh too late!<br />
		You can see auras, good for you,<br />
		a spiritual dis-ease is mucky colours? cool!<br />
		Do you examine yourself this way too, Mr. Guru?<br />
		<br />

		I'm just watching karma flow, from the small<br />
		to the big, endless ripples of soft data.<br />
		I look again, I see outside, the fields,<br />
		a sea of those I know and love, and farther,<br />
		to all who touch me, and then all things.<br />
		<br />

		I sing a song..<br />
		This inextricable web of action that extends, extends<br />
		through all dimension, never ends. Never seeking an end, just working,<br />
		all is at hand, and there I was thinking<br />
		something was wrong.<br />
		<br />

<!--*g*-->The notion that Karma is energy is illuminating or should I say electrifying to me. No longer is karma split or immutable. In times where we feel we are being tested by bad stuff, perhaps it is time to consider energy and what we are doing with it? Blessings are challenges in disguise.<br />

<!--*g*--><blockquote><div class="blockquote"><small><strong>sandra said..</strong></small><br />
<cite>"perhaps it is time to consider energy and what we are doing with it?"</cite></div></blockquote>
<br />
If a person can keep that forefront in their mind, for even a few minutes a day, their life will radically change. Every action; and thoughts are actions if they do more than simply pass through our minds; changes the patterns of energy around us. "Thinking positive", whatever that means to you, brings positive results, in the same way that when you drop a stone in a pond, the ripples spread outward. That is nature. Here the medium is not liquid, but <strong>Mind Matter</strong>, of which our universe is composed.<br />
<br />
Those ripples will bounce and interact and be altered and transmuted and all-sorts before returning to the centre, if at all. That is Mind, that is humans.<br />
<br />
Arise early, while the Sun still rises. Few humans are around yet, and the airwaves are clear. Your pure and focused thoughts are free to travel unhindered in all directions. You can lay out your plan for the day now, and more. And when the people awake, they will find your plan ready made all around them. And they will have to work around it, or with it. It is there, like the bricks and cars and shops are there.<br />
<br />
If there is trouble in your neighbourhood, get some of your neighbours to do the same thing. Or in your business. In this manner you can quickly prove to yourself the value of "positive thinking". <br />
<br />
<strong>jeminai</strong>, you are so very correct. Of all the lessons of physics, this one has continuously proven most crucial to my grasping the deeper truths of non-physical realities. <br />
<br />
Even a simple computer, when asked to perform "1+1", uses energy to produce the result, "2", and then has to <em>do something</em> with the "1", the "+", and the other "1" (as well as the zillion other bits of processed information it must now discard). Of course, a computer simply dissipates all this as heat energy, and radiates it into the room. We dissipate some as heat, too, but in the same way that 97% of a loudspeaker's energy may be dissipated as heat, it's the VOLUME that matters, and it only takes a tiny bit of energy to produce a *lot* of volume. So it is with thoughts.<br />
<br />
Every wish, every desire, every thought, <em>went somewhere</em>. Nothing is lost.<br />
<br />
<strong>jay</strong>, use of the term "previous karma" shows that you need to consider the issue more deeply. There is no such thing.<br />
<br />
Consider; I make the stupid mistake of walking along some railway lines. Unfortunately, the mistake costs me my arms. From then on, people call me "armless", and make jokes about how there's never a timetable handy when you need it, which makes me angry.<br />
<br />
I have no arms and I am angry. I am changed, and it's not the arms, and it's not the anger, so what is it?<br />
<br />
No? <img alt="smiley for :lol:" title=":lol:" src="/blog/inc/smileys/lol.gif" /> <br />
Okay, how about this..<br />
<br />
On the same day, at exactly the same time, two twins, now living on other sides of the world, call their next door neighbour "an old goat".<br />
<br />
The first does it in fun, he is quite fond of his old neighbour.<br />
The second does it in fun, he is quite fond of his old neighbour, too.<br />
<br />
The first neighbour suggests a game of chess. They play chess.<br />
The second neighbour flees in horror, he shags goats.<br />
<br />
The first neighbour shags goats, too, but he doesn't see anything wrong with that, and in fact, plans to introduce twin one to his bleeting harem after the chess, because twin one seems to have hinted that he, too, might be interested in such dubious pleasures.<br />
<br />
Neighbour two has already tried this in a previous neighbourhood, and had to move two thousand miles because of it. He still shags goats, though, but tells no one.<br />
<br />
What's the difference?<br />
<br />
Both "events" are exactly what the neighbours needed at their stage of evolution, of course. The two neighbours appear to get exactly the same "event", yet clearly it is very different, <em>to them.</em> And perhaps twin two has a thing for Llamas, and their scenario is unfolding in altogether different directions! Two people can look at a piece of art, a picture; one sees nothing, the other's life is changed. Same picture. <br />
<br />
Remember, it's <em>people </em>that change, not the laws of the Universe, not the principles of Karma. It's people that carry guilt, fear, etc.; baggage. And all the while you carry these things, you vibrate frequencies which will attract events designed to assist you in evolving beyond them. aka. "you got it coming". Karma doesn't care, it simply does its job of providing exactly what you need at all times. Get past it.<br />
<br />
The crucial caveat is that even <em>thinking </em>in terms of "good" and "bad" negates your ability to understand the true workings of Karma and its function in your spiritual evolution. I personally use the word "good" as a technical term, meaning "Good for You", same story for "Bad". In the technical sense, Karma is always "Good".<br />
<br />
When these polar concepts are enlarged into the global scope, that is "Mankind", we call them "Right" and "Wrong". But before you can really get a handle on Right and Wrong, you have to get past all this "good and bad".<br />
<br />
<em>"bad actions"</em>, pardon?<br />
<br />
Probably you mean, "actions which I knew were <em>wrong</em>, but did them anyway!". In other words, it's YOU adding the "Bad" label, because you personally considered the action to be wrong. It was this defiance of your own true sense of right and wrong, acting out of accord with your true nature, THAT is what you carry, THAT is what is causing all these "bad events" to occur, not Karma. It doesn't care. And in a former life, you probably wouldn't care, either. Innocense really is bliss, but joy is better.<br />
<br />
When you are rich and famous you can perhaps donate some huge sum of my money to corz.org for this tool which I will give you now. This tool is a mantra, and it's its use is simple, you just say it aloud and <em>mean it</em>. And you will instantly negate all that "Bad Karma" that you have, for some entirely human reason, suddenly accumulated with your thoughtless wrong-doing. Here goes..<br />
<h3>&nbsp;"Next Time!"</h3>
Simple, huh? But you have to <em>mean it</em>, or else there's no point. But if you are even thinking along these lines, that you might like to stop doing wrong stuff and start doing right stuff instead, you are probably ready to grasp the power of it. <br />
<br />
You might also find some inspiration in the following quotation..<br />

<!--*g*-->This seems to make a lot of sense. I am trying to find out about karma, energy, luck &amp; how my former friend could have possibly tied the three together so much so that she was convinced that I didn't need to be around her because I was bad luck to her. Huh?! I've always been called others' God send or good luck, though I've always just considered myself a good friend by my nature. This explains why karma &amp; luck don't mix, which just confuses me even more, &amp;, in researching earth &amp; universe based beliefs I've never known of karma or energy to be mixed with luck. I was just wondering has anyone else?<!--*g*--><br />

<!--*g*-->I'm an Afrikaans speaking 34 year lady, my life wasn't easy but it wasn't bad either, i'm a realistic person and find the Karmic Law interresting, well lets just say it works for me. Stay positive and positive things happens to me and otherwise.<br />
<br />
So what is so wrong with believing in something good or to make yourself a better person. All the negative feedback I have read in this column just tells me more about the person who is struggling with him/herself, but give a few more years and lets hear their opinion again.<img alt="smiley for :lol:" title=":lol:" src="/blog/inc/smileys/lol.gif" /><!--*g*--><br />

<!--*g*-->Everyone has there own opinions on Karma, and mine, whether you agree or not is this. Karma is an energy, but its neither good nor bad, its as 2 folded as the coins in your pocket. Every deed that you do affects many people, as we are all connected, but not everyone will experience the same Karmic effect, regardless of the intension. Some people will experience a positive effect, and some a negative effect, and there is balance in the world.<!--*g*--><br />

<!--*g*-->Karma is different for everyone.  Otherwise there would be a list of rules.  There isn't.  Something I do wrong may not be wrong to someone else.  So if they feel they haven't done anything wrong they don't need to be "paid back" with bad karma.  It all has to do with your own morals and values and how you live your life.<br />
<br />
When ever something bad happens to me I usually say to myself I musta did something to deserve it.  And I am sure I always do.<!--*g*--><br />

<!--*g*-->What if Karma had nothing to do with the past?<br />
<br />
Seriously, you hear people bitchin' and moaning about "why did this happen to me?" and try to explore what they did that created such karma.<br />
<br />
But what if Karma had NOTHING to do with the past?<br />
<br />
Maybe Karma isn't about cause-and-effect as it is about situation-and-response.<br />
<br />
When you look at karma as a manifestation of past deeds you get either reward for good deeds or punishment for bad deeds. Period. Your options are closed and that's pretty crappy.<br />
<br />
So what if Karma was only about the here-and-now? Meaning whatever you are experiencing is not about what you did (the past) but about what you can do now with what you have.<br />
<br />
Taking a look at it from this perspective and you can start to see that you are not a slave to karma but an explorer of the options karma gives you.<br />
<br />
When I'm listening to one of my "Masters" I can hear him say it EVERY TIME "The person with the most choices and the most levels at which they can choose will always get ahead. So if you don't have many choices in your situations then consider your choices of how you respond to it."<br />
<br />
Instead of asking "Why did this happen?" you COULD ask "What great thing can I learn from this?" or "How is this going to make me a better person?"<br />
<br />
What amazes me is the number of people who DON'T get what I'm talking about! I'm constantly amazed at how deeply some people are committed to their own suffering.<br />

<!--*g*-->i belive that karma is energy also. it cannot be created or destroyed only transferred. but also i belive that it is like a rubber band. the negative energy "defying mother nature" that you put out acts like a rubber band the more you push against it the harder it is to move forward in life.when you back up and change paths the rubber band is not in front of you and you can move forward with virtually no energy.untill you build negative energy again.i also belive you can use it to your advantage to build positive energy around you to sling yourself through life quite easily. just my thoughts<img alt="smiley for ;)" title=";)" src="/blog/inc/smileys/wink.gif" /><!--*g*--><br />
