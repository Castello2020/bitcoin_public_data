In The Mirror - Tim caffery
In The Mirror
I place my self before the mirror
Press my palms in reverence
I reflect on the reflection
My essence projected back at me
More than a shadow
Yet far less than
Less than my what
It is me and what I am
The mirror reflects what I create
Create when I am before it
For absent me there is no reflection
My cause of devotion Devotion to whatever I project into the mirror
In my life to manifest
I can patiently wait for defeat
Cowardly fight to no avail
Regularly face my lack of commitment
Or just see me
See the reflection is me
As I am
As I choose to be
A tree would reflect a tree
A cat a cat
A criminal a person
A mother a person
A child a person
Me a person
You a person
We can’t find our identity in the image
It’s only a reflection
And the mirror is a mirror
And I, I know what I am.
