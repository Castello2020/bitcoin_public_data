The same as you won’t believe what you read here you shouldn’t believe what you hear or see on the tv.
Look into it yourself.

Wake Up.




As I have noted, the FBI raided my apartment in Dallas on the morning of March 6th. I was not there at
the time; I had been given a vague warning that a raid was to take place the next day, so I went to my
mom&#39;s place, where she lives with her husband, who is out of town, on the 5th. On the morning of the
6th, three FBI agents came to my mom&#39;s door and asked if I was there. She woke me up and I went
down to talk to them. They told me that they&#39;d executed a search warrant at my apartment and that the
door had been broken in the process, and then asked me if I had any laptops with me here at my mom&#39;s
place that I wanted to give them. I responded in the negative, and they left. At that point I began taking
calls and e-mails from the press regarding Sabu, whom I learned was in fact a degenerate pussy traitor
who couldn&#39;t face two fucking years in prison, making him the biggest pussy in the history of mankind.
There were several people who came to this conclusion early on; I was not wise enough to be one of
them. As to the various stunts he pulled in the months since his arrest - including but not limited to the
unnecessary release of credit card information for Stratfor customers - we may never know to what
extent such things were encouraged by his &quot;Justice Department&quot; handlers in an effort to discredit this
movement. But I digress, lol. At any rate, the Feds came back a couple of hours later with a search
warrant for my mom&#39;s place - they fully intended to take a certain laptop, and did.



The documentation left with me by the FBI after the raid on my mother&#39;s home states that the evidence
they were looking for pertains to &quot;conspiracy to obstruct justice, and the obstruction of justice, i.e.
tampering with a victim, witness, or informant&quot; and &quot;conspiracy to access without authorization
protected computers, and fraud and related activity in connection with computers (aiding and abetting),
in whatever form, namely:



1. Records relating to HBGary;

2. Records relating to Infragard;

3. Records relating to Endgame Systems;

4. Records relating to Anonymous;

5. Records relating to Lulzsec;

6. Records relating to IRC chat;

7. Records relating to Twitter;

8. Records relating to wiki.echelon2.org;

9. Records relating to pastebin.com;&quot;



... and then goes on to list computers and anything relating to them as things to be seized.
I am happy to post this list as it contains the names of two firms - HBGary and Endgame Systems - which
I will now have particular opportunity to discuss, in a more public setting, as this matter proceeds.

Greetings Pirates, and welcome to another exciting #FuckFBIFriday release.



As part of our ongoing effort to expose and humiliate our white hat enemies, we

targeted a Special Agent Supervisor of the CA Department of Justice in charge of

computer crime investigations. We are leaking over 38,000 private emails which

contain detailed computer forensics techniques, investigation protocols as well

as highly embarrassing personal information. We are confident these gifts will

bring smiles to the faces of our black hat brothers and sisters (especially

those who have been targeted by these scurvy dogs) while also making a mockery

of &quot;security professionals&quot; who whore their &quot;skills&quot; to law enforcement to

protect tyrannical corporativism and the status quo we aim to destroy.



We hijacked two gmail accounts belonging to Fred Baclagan, who has been a cop
for 20 years, dumping his private email correspondence as well as several dozen

voicemails and SMS text message logs. While just yesterday Fred was having a

private BBQ with his CATCHTEAM high computer crime task force friends, we were

reviewing their detailed internal operation plans and procedure documents. We

also couldn&#39;t overlook the boatloads of embarrassing personal information about

our cop friend Fred. We lulzed as we listened to angry voicemails from his

estranged wives and ex-girlfriends while also reading his conversations with

girls who responded to his &quot;man seeking woman&quot; craigslist ads. We turned on his

google web history and watched him look up linux command line basics, golfing

tutorials, and terrible youtube music videos. We also abused his google

voice account, making sure Fred&#39;s friends and family knew how hard he was owned.



Possibly the most interesting content in his emails are the IACIS.com internal

email list archives (2005-2011) which detail the methods and tactics cybercrime

units use to gather electronic evidence, conduct investigations and make

arrests. The information in these emails will prove essential to those who want

to protect themselves from the techniques and procedures cyber crime

investigators use to build cases. If you have ever been busted for computer

crimes, you should check to see if your case is being discussed here. There are

discussions about using EnCase forensic software, attempts to crack TrueCrypt

encrypted drives, sniffing wireless traffic in mobile surveillance vehicles, how

to best prepare search warrants and subpoenas, and a whole lot of clueless

people asking questions on how to use basic software like FTP. In the end, we

rickrolled the entire IACIS list, causing the administrators to panic and shut

their list and websites down.
These cybercrime investigators are supposed to be the cream of the crop, but we

reveal the totality of their ignorance of all matters related to computer

security. For months, we have owned several dozen white hat and law enforcement

targets-- getting in and out of whichever high profile government and corporate

system we please and despite all the active FBI investigations and several

billion dollars of funding, they have not been able to stop us or get anywhere

near us. Even worse, they bust a few dozen people who are allegedly part of an

&quot;anonymous computer hacking conspiracy&quot; but who have only used

kindergarten-level DDOS tools-- this isn&#39;t even hacking, but a form of

electronic civil disobedience.



We often hear these &quot;professionals&quot; preach about &quot;full-disclosure,&quot; but we are

sure these people are angrily sending out DMCA takedown notices and serving

subpoenas as we speak. They call us criminals, script kiddies, and terrorists,

but their entire livelihood depends on us, trying desperately to study our

techniques and failing miserably at preventing future attacks. See we&#39;re cut

from an entirely different kind of cloth. Corporate security professionals like

Thomas Ryan and Aaron Barr think they&#39;re doing something noble by &quot;leaking&quot; the

public email discussion lists of Occupy Wall Street and profiling the &quot;leaders&quot;

of Anonymous. Wannabe player haters drop shitty dox and leak partial chat logs

about other hackers, doing free work for law enforcement. Then you got people

like Peiter &quot;Mudge&quot; Zatko who back in the day used to be old school l0pht/cDc

only now to sell out to DARPA going around to hacker conventions encouraging

others to work for the feds. Let this be a warning to aspiring white hat
&quot;hacker&quot; sellouts and police collaborators: stay out the game or get owned and

exposed. You want to keep mass arresting and brutalizing the 99%? We&#39;ll have to

keep owning your boxes and torrenting your mail spools, plastering your personal

information all over teh internets.



Hackers, join us and rise up against our common oppressors - the white hats, the

1%&#39;s &#39;private&#39; police, the corrupt banks and corporations and make 2011 the year

of leaks and revolutions!



We are Anti-Security,

We are the 99%

We do not forgive.

We do not forget.

Expect Us!

Thanks for the information Jimmy. I&#39;ll check with our hosting company to make

sure we&#39;re secure. Unfortunately a lot of local law enforcement agencies email

servers have been compromised recently. It&#39;s hard to say which server this

thread was found on (ours or one of the compromised servers).

Jimmy,

     Thanks for letting us know about this post; however, I doubt very, very

seriously that it came from an FBI server. I personally believe it came

from someone&#39;s personal post some where or a small department, etc. Who

knows it may have come directly off of our own (IACIS) server, but I do not

believe it came from an FBI server, unless it came from a seeded honey pot

and if it did anonymousabu might want to think about relocating.

Later,

David House: My name is David House.

PM: Did you meet Bradley Manning in January 2010?

DH: On the advice of counsel, I invoke my right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment to the
United States Constitution. I am concerned that this grand jury is seeking information designed to
infringe or chill my associational privacy, and that of others, guaranteed by the First Amendment to the
United States Constitution, and that it is using information obtained without a search warrant in
violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. I define the preceding statement
as “invoke”, and when I say “I invoke” in the future I am referring to this statement.

Deborah Curtis: Exhibit 1-A?

PM: Mr. House, please direct your attention to the screen behind you, exhibit 1-A.
DC: I can’t make it bigger.

PM: Try… here, remove that bar on the side.

DC: That didn’t work.

DH: Do you guys need help?

DH: I invoke.

PM: Are we to believe that identifying that individual would somehow incriminate you?

DH: On the advice of counsel, I invoke my right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment to the
United States Constitution. I am concerned that this grand jury is seeking information designed to
infringe or chill my associational privacy, and that of others, guaranteed by the First Amendment to the
United States Constitution, and that it is using information obtained without a search warrant in
violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

PM: I would like to observe for the record that Mr. House is taking notes.

DH: As to the previous question, I invoke.

As we all know, xvisceral was arrested last night for:

Conspiracy to commit computer hacking (10 years in prison)

Distribution of malware (10 years in prison)
( http://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2012/manhattan-u.s.-attorney-and-fbi-assistant-director-

Well the belief at the moment is that he was found via an underground carding site owned by an HF
member here by the name of m4v3r1ck. m4v3r1ck only has 17 posts. Now why in the hell would Omni
let someone with so little qualifications be an Ub3r? But let&#39;s slow down here. m4v3r1ck is an FBI agent,
right? So that means that Omni let him have Ub3r so that he could further explore HF and search for
those who were committing serious crimes. I&#39;m not saying that Omni is behind a conspiracy here but I
do know that he helped to get xvisceral arrested and openly told members who were suspicious to join
this FBI-monitored site. You can protect him all you want but when it comes right down to it, with the
facts I have gathered today, Omni is enabling the FBI to spy on what we do on this site and openly telling
members to go to a site that is even more strictly monitored. If you ever openly said that you infect
other computers then you are theoretically a target by the FBI now.



Here is a picture of the chat that is most likely the reason why xvisceral was arrested:



http://i.imgur.com/YSYTs.png



This m4v3r1ck gentleman offered to buy HF but Omni denied it. In the process, he made an
announcement telling the members of HF that if they want to do illegal activities such as stealing credit
cards, that they have to join m4v3r1ck&#39;s underground site. Here is m4v3r1ck&#39;s thread about his
&quot;Blackhat forum&quot;:

Take a look at Omni&#39;s announcement here where he openly told members who wanted to discuss illegal
activities to go to the FBI-monitored site: http://www.hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=474743



Omni tried to get members to join that site. If you were discussing illegal things then you were to be
sent a PM asking you to move to m4v3r1ck&#39;s site so that you could be tracked like a dog by the FBI.
If you have found anything else, please post below. If you disagree then please post below with facts to
back up your claims.

A user named Bay posted this story earlier:



They came to my house. I&#39;m freaking out right now. I opened the door and an agent said &quot;Hi, I&#39;m agent
**** and I&#39;m with the FBI. He showed me his badge. They asked me if I was ** ** and I said yes. They
said that they need to talk to me about my online activity. They had to leave because no one was home
besides me. They said I need to have a parent present. They tried calling my mom at work but couldn&#39;t
get a hold of her. One of the two agents that showed up gave me his card and his number and said to
call them when I get a hold of my mom.



I&#39;m so scared right now.



I don&#39;t see why they showed up. I haven&#39;t done anything. I swear to God. This is not a troll.
Picture taken from my Skype Webcam of the Card:

http://i.imgur.com/ITjl4.png




I just talked with them for an hour. It was about carderprofit.cc since I was a member on there for a
short period of time. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t stay on that site. My advice to everyone: DON&#39;T DO BLACKHAT
SHIT!



#####################################################################################
#########

Omniscient, owner of HackForums.net, replies to his criticism:



Seems some shit hit the fan today and a popular carding forum was actually an FBI undercover website.
As such a couple prominent members here who were active there have been arrested.



I was notified this morning by members. I had no idea of this shit storm before today.



The owner of the UC FBI site is a member here. At some point the member wanted to buy HF but
wanted to turn it into a carding forum. I didn&#39;t want to be involved in such an illegal activity that might
actually bring me problems. We settled on a compromise that I would promote his new site in exchange
for advertising money which was already a deposit made to buy HF. We had met here in Vegas and he
stated he was from Ukraine...had the accent too. I never got the impression he was anyone but who he
said he was. I assisted with the setup of CPF by installing some plugins and building their theme. After a
few months I told the owner I didn&#39;t want to be involved anymore and that I filled my obligation.



So HF was never sold and I&#39;m still the owner to this day. I really honestly can&#39;t say if he was FBI himself,
turned at some point, or maybe the site was seized. I just don&#39;t know beyond what I read in the FBI
report today.



My gut aches at this news. It&#39;s very unfortunate that I somehow got involved. That being said HF is not a
BH site and I don&#39;t pity people who take chances the way those who were arrested have. I&#39;ve never
wanted that type of activity here and now you know why. It&#39;s very dangerous. HF is an open forum
where posts are not hidden and anyone can join. You&#39;re a real dumb ass to admit to anything here.



I&#39;ve closed the account of the owner of the UC FBI site. All his IP connections seem to be socks. He was
never a very active member here but did ask me MyBB questions every now and then. He was an ub3r
as a courtesy. I did meet the guy and he did pay me good money in cash. One thing makes sense to me
now though. When he was going to buy HF he said he was going to delete the site and start over with a
BH Carding site. I told him that was a terrible idea but he gave the excuse he wanted a more exclusive
site. Eventually his idea to start a new site with my help was formed. Makes me wonder if there wasn&#39;t
some legal reason like entrapment to delete the existing site.



I&#39;m a bit overwhelmed by this. I&#39;m not sure what to believe. It&#39;s been over 18 months since I last even
had a PM with the guy. The person I met didn&#39;t feel suspicious to me. I feel like I&#39;m in some story or
movie right now. All so odd. I can only imagine how crazy things would be if I really did sell HF back then
to this guy.



You can btw read the original thread about the sale and promotion of his site here:

http://www.hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=474743



Some are questioning if they should remain members of HF. And I think if you&#39;re doing something here
that you&#39;re concerned about then maybe you should leave. Because as always I&#39;m not here to protect
you. I don&#39;t encourage using computers for illegal activity and if that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing then that&#39;s
your problem. My legal disclaimer is simple. I will not share your private member data without a valid US
Court subpoena.



http://www.hackforums.net/misc.php?action=help&amp;hid=12

&quot;We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary when the law
requires us to comply.&quot;



I take sharing of private member data very very seriously. Anyone in staff can confirm this and anyone
who&#39;s ever tried to get me to give up an IP or email knows that too.
I will not host HF offshore either. It wouldn&#39;t make any difference anyways because I&#39;m a U.S. citizen
subject to US laws. You joined a U.S. hosted site.



Please note that it doesn&#39;t seem like any HF members who were not members of CPF were arrested. It
does seem specific that members of that site are the ones at risk. If HF was an FBI operation or under
investigation I think we&#39;d be closed down today. HF is not imho at risk of being shut down. I take great
pains to make sure we operate within legal limits. I personally do not participate in any computer crime
whatsoever. I&#39;m the admin here and give customer support for upgrades and stickies.



Another thing...I haven&#39;t mentioned or advertised CPF for years now. Over the years people have been
arrested that are indeed members of HF. I don&#39;t find that shocking considering that the arrest rate is
about 5% of americans are arrested at some point. We&#39;ve seen members post about DUI, robberies, and
of course cyber crime charges. Seems only about 2-3 actual HF members are involved in this report. Out
of 300k members and after 5+ years only a few arrested and those were actually from ANOTHER forum
does not add up to me being directly involved. It just doesn&#39;t. Believe what you want but I had zero
knowledge about these arrests.



I&#39;ve stated numerous times that I was sure and still sure that we have law enforcement as members
here. I wouldn&#39;t doubt they have accounts on just about every hacking, cracking, warez, or carding
forum that exists.



I&#39;ve deactivated the Blackshades private forum for now. Unsure what I&#39;ll do about the group. It&#39;s likely
the owner of the group won&#39;t be around for a while...if ever. Considering the report I just read about the
owners arrest I think it&#39;s best to remove the forum section.



Ugh...what a mess this is. I completely understand member concerns though. Unsure if my statement
has helped any but it&#39;s everything I know at this time. Fuck this sucks. But I think just like the gazillion
other dramas of HF this will pass in a week and we&#39;ll all be doing what we normally do. Other than the
drama this has created 0 change in my day.



Well on the bright side those who DDOS HF might think twice now.
I&#39;ll leave this thread open and try to answer questions but I won&#39;t tolerate being disrespected. You&#39;re
warned.

I still believe Omni was behind this. Users do not have the ability to close their own accounts. Which
means Omni did it after he found people knew about it.




         It is hard for me to express how much I appreciate your letter, which is the first I have received
here, along with the support I’ve reportedly gotten from others so far. Before I forget, let me request
that you also send a tweet of support to Jenna, @ElviraXMontana on Twitter; as my girlfriend, she had
to watch as the FBI crushed my ribs (which I believe will be healed in time even if I’ve had trouble
acquiring medical attention due to me under Geneva; put in formal request for X-ray last night here at
Mansfield, whereas last week at Lew Sterrett I was sent to medic by an officer Tamer before being
instead re-directed to what is intended as a temporary holding cell for those about to be released on
bond, this change of plan being instigated by an officer Roeun (sic?) whom I have since reported to the
proper authorities. Despite my having explained her mistake politely twice over the course of the next
seven hours, and despite my condition having been serious enough to have prompted other inmates to
suggest I check for internal bleeding, I was screamed at and then later simply ordered to lay down, all of
which was witnessed by two other inmates, one of whom promised to inform Tim Rogers of D Magazine
that I was potentially dying and needed intervention ASAP as soon as he himself was released a few
minutes hence (again, this was the temporary outgoing holding cell, not meant for housing inmates for
anything longer than an hour or so as their bond is processed; as such, I was not fed, either, much less
given my medication, suboxone. Note that none of the treatment I received at Lou Sterrit had anything
to do with who I am or what I am accused of, – it is simply the natural result of the inhumane and
degenerate mentality found within the Texas “corrections” system, something I first described in a 2005
article for Towards Freedom. It is something we will have to address more firmly over the coming years,
just as we have addressed North Africa and the intelligence contracting industry since late 2010. And I
note all of this not merely to complain—although to complain is among the few vices I have been left
aside from bragging to my fellow inmates – but to illustrate the fundamental problem that so many of
us have sacrificed or risked to combat. This problem, which even Richard Nixon recognized and spoke
about on that famed evening at the Lincoln Memorial, is that a republic built with the blood of giants
has since become a “wild animal.” – one that now feeds upon us all.

       I try to avoid metaphors, which can illuminate but in practice are too often used to obscure. Like
many aspects of language, the false metaphor kills and enslaves. And at any rate, there will be time to
discuss these broader issues later. For now, I must ask you to publish this on pastebin, Anonpaste,
piratepad.de, and all other available venues, and that you also send it to some of the journalists that
have been kind enough to follow my work as well as the consequences thereof, particularly my friend
Michael Hastings, Barry Eisler, Michael Riley (Bloomberg), Ryan Gallagher (Guardian), and Josh at Daily
Caller (forgot his last name) – plus the former editor of The Yemen Times who’s now at Global Times or
some such and who, along with a certain Washington Times correspondent known to Gregg Housh, plus
one or two others that I know of, who are now looking into Romas/COIN due in part to my release of the
NYT e-mails earlier this month. Along with others in both the mainstream and independent media, these
are most likely to report accurately on this matter. Having been mischaracterized at least a hundred
times by “professional” journalists since I first appeared on Fox News in January 2009 to denounce
Obama’s association with the goofy fascist Rick Warren – and was introduced as being spokesman for
the non-existent “American Atheist Society” rather than GAMPAC. This would be a good time to note,
particularly for the benefit of certain journalists, that I am not and never have been the spokesman for
Anonymous, nor its “public face” or, worse, “self-proclaimed” “face” or “spokesperson” or “leader” (as
the CIA-funded Radio Free Europe called me last year when I felt compelled to “quit” the non-group that
I’d never technically joined in the first place, but rather gradually attached myself to as Wikileaks and
Tunisia went down in December of 2010). Anyone who cares to learn what happens to a person who
decides to help deal with such issues at the request and with the knowledge of active Anons can search
my name in conjunction with those terms, and then see the article “Barrett Brown is Anonymous” from
April 2011 in which I explain clearly, as I have countless times since, that no one has the authority to
designate me as such. It is known to some of those who worked out of Anonops or were otherwise
particularly active in the beginning of 2011 that I wrote or edited a number of the press releases of that
time, and that the al-Jazeera article written in the first few days of January and which appeared later
that month under the title “Anonymous and the Global Correction” was also my work – something I
revealed privately to the brilliant cyberpunk essayist Bruce Sterling after he openly speculated as to the
author’s background in Wired, noting the sentiments to be that of a true revolutionary. Among those
who now agree with him are the FBI, which has since responded accordingly – and unethically.

       Contrary to the countless claims to the effect that I hold some official role in Anonymous, I can
think of only one occasion in which any Anon has come close to actually deeming me as such, that being
the day on which HBGary was hacked in retaliation for HBGary Federal CEO Aaron Baar’s claim – shown
to be entirely false – that he had identified Anon’s “lieutenants” and “co-founder” and that he had been
contacted by the FBI about this. In fact, he had conflated three different people including a professional
gardener and, as shown in the notes Anon released along with the e-mails taken from HBGary Federal,
had made a huge number of additional mistakes – something since confirmed by everyone concerned
including Barr himself. (That the Financial Times writer who had bought Barr’s self-promotion would
again essay to write about Anonymous months later, this time taking the claims of a Dutch kid at face
value in the course of “reporting” various negative things about how the movement operates, is only
one of numerous bizarre and depressing twists to this story; I myself would later encounter him on
Canada television as a panelist during a discussion in which he accused Anon of being particularly anti-
“American interest”, to which I responded that it is difficult to avoid stepping on the empire’s toes when
one assists North Africans in fighting off dictatorships that the US has supported for years.) (Oh snap!)
On that day, as recorded on pastebin from the discussion on the #OPHBGary channel at Anonops, I was
referred to in passing as “our public face” to a journalist. I was on the phone to HBGary President Penny
Hoglund at the time, apologizing that HBGary’s e-mails had been seized by Sabu in addition to HBGary
Federal’s, instructing her on how to get on IRC in order to make her case directly to the hackers, and
promising to remove the link I had put up to the 70,000 e-mails acquired in the operation, a link I had
placed upon a Daily Kos post put up to explain the situation to the great many who would miss the
“makeover” done to HBGary.com. Had I known that Penny was lying to me about what she and husband
Greg Hoglund had known about Barr’s irresponsible attempt to save his own career at the expense of
the innocent and heroic alike, I would have simply hung up. Instead, I was polite – but I recorded the
call, just as I recorded the next call with Barr, the next call with HBGary exec Jim Butterworth, and finally
the drunken call I received months later from Greg Hoglund himself. “Trust but verify,” as Reagan said in
the context of a different set of villains.

       With the exception of the ten minute convo I released between myself and Aaron Barr, all of the
other recordings – and plenty of others – are in the possession of the FBI, which raided my apartment as
well as my mother’s home on March 6th. For more on those events, as well as the criminal conspiracy to
which I have been subjected by elements of the FBI, HBGary, and paid informant/contractor Jennifer
Emick (among other parties both known and undiscovered), please see the last 3 videos I uploaded to
my YouTube account, as well as documents I linked to on my Twitter account @BarrettBrownLOL in the
final days before my most recent (and dramatic!) arrest. Not everything is released; I was interrupted by
armed, mediocre federal agents and DPD officers (“No complicity in assassination of a chief executive
since 1963!”) before I could finish making my case, which was to be done over several days before the
entirety would be sent to the FBI and the judge who signed my March search warrant. This was to be
followed by the instigation of a civil suit against HBGary and other parties to be named in the next 2
months. My plan has been disrupted – plans often are, as history tells us – but it has not been rendered
obsolete. It will evolve, just as ProjectPM itself has evolved steadily since 2009, when this war became
evident to me, when I first realized that my future as a political satirist would have to be abandoned in
favor of this dirty, grueling struggle.

       But why was I arrested this time? I would love to tell you. But the prosecution wouldn’t like that.
I, and everyone else in the court room, were ordered to refrain from discussing the complaint, affidavits,
and warrant, all of which are sealed at the request of the author, one FBI special agent whom I shall not
name lest I give him cause for fright (or pretend fright – I am allegedly a danger to one especially skittish
special agent whom I shall be careful not to name again until such time as I am prepared to list him in
the civil suit I’ve been preparing for weeks now). Frankly, I do not blame this other special agent for
requesting that the document be sealed – if I had written something of such low quality and
demonstrable untruth, I would burn it and ask forgiveness of every deity invented by man and the
higher apes/dolphins/whales. Likewise, if I were the US attorney who signed the Motion for Detention
dated September 13 2012 – the document that, after having been approved by Judge Paul D. Stickney,
ensured I would not only be prevented from discussing what I’m being accused of but also made a
prisoner of the state until such time as a trial or some such can be concocted out of the jurisprudential
magick I struggle to follow, in my innocence. Apparently I am not just a danger to the fragile FBI agents
who have taken to threatening my mother and fracturing my ribs in the course of heavily-armed raids on
my uptown Dallas apartment, but must be prevented from explaining to my associates, followers, and
even enemies why I have again been subjected to violence and indignity.

        I explained the first raid against me (March 6th, 6:30 a.m. CST) and the second against my mother
(about six hours later) in several pastebin messages at that time. It was not until 2 months ago that I
learned how a judge had been tricked into permitting this raid on me – how the disgraced contracting
firm HBGary hired the paid FBI informant Jennifer Emick to, in their words, “find something to get [me]
picked up on,” even as this bizarre former Anon made public accusations against me under both her real
name and her adopted contractor persona: “FakeGreggHoush” on Twitter (now “AsherahResearch”) and
Asherah on IRC – particularly the 2600 server where she frequented the #jester channel alongside
various ex-military men and current “security’ contractors who all found themselves inclined to
associate with the admitted criminal hacker th3J35T3R, one of several parties who have taken credit for
DoS attacks on Wikileaks. I should not have to remind anyone that 40 U.S. homes were raided in January
2011 due to a similar but less effective series of DDoS attacks on Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and Amazon
which were clearly an act of protest against an unprecedented economic blockade ordered by the U.S.
regime. 14 of the “criminals” in question are being charged such that they face up to 15 years in prison.
Thanks largely to Jay Leiderman the California attorney and John Penley the NYC activist and veteran,
many of them are being represented for free. Likewise, I will seek and accept only pro bono assistance
from this point on, though with the stipulation that I will pay any such lawyers what I can from the
defense funds that have been set up for me thus far by well-wishers. As of this writing I dismiss Tom
Mills, whom I retained for $3,500 after receiving bad advice from a well-meaning person. I will also
expect that money returned within 60 days of the publication of this missive online (ProjectPM
participants, please ensure that he receives this message, which I have also delivered through my
mother – whom he falsely claimed to be representing on the matter of the FBI threats against her
despite having been paid by me, not her). And as I had noted both publicly and privately earlier this
month, I am still seeking additional attorneys with skill in civil litigation to pursue at least two suits I’ll be
filing by the end of the year. Those interested may write to me at my new home, Some Jail in Texas. I am
able to arrange for phone conversations with any applicants (or anyone else who is either especially
interesting or who is able to accept a collect call or contribute $5 to my commissary/phone fund, that
being the cost of a 15-minute call instigated by me). Anyone who writes me without us having been
formerly introduced, I will guarantee a response if you send self-addressed stamped envelope. Also I
believe that only mail with a return address will be delivered to me, though I’m not sure.

        I hate that I have spent so much time in conflict over the past two years, and that so much of this
has involved my fellow American citizens rather than the Middle Eastern dictators that I got involved in
this to combat. I feel sorrow at the lost opportunities, and as for the way it has changed me as a
person… I like to think that I am wiser and less na&#239;ve than I was, but I know too well how foolish and
unsophisticated I was to begin with. I cannot excuse the mistakes I myself have made on both the
strategic and tactical levels in my short career. I shudder when I look back on some of the things I wrote
or said when I got my first real taste of power at the dawn of 2011, and I continue to bring shame upon
myself and upon my family and work by some of the things I say even lately. In particular I have made
comments about the U.S. military that I do not mean and which are obviously not entirely accurate.
Along with other nonsense I have said, felt, written throughout my life, many of these things originate
from my own fears and weaknesses. I am humiliated at not being able to protect my own mother from
the FBI, or to shield my own girlfriend from watching heavily-armed men step on my spine as I scream in
pain. I cannot forget how my mom cried on March 6th after the FBI had left with my equipment and
hers, and how she whispered through tears that she wanted to be able to protect me from prison but
couldn’t; I will never forget the look on Jenna’s face as the federal thugs swept through my efficiency
apartment with guns drawn and safeties off, in search of hidden assailants and non-existent weapons.
That these things are unjust and increasingly insane does not change the fact that they are the result of
my own behavior, my own miscalculations, my own choices.

       Having said that, I regret nothing. For the last week I was denied opiates and thus forced to feel
not just rage, hatred, all the primal things, but forced to endure them while sicker than most humans
can imagine and in a jail that is overcrowded and filled with common criminals. I have gained something
extraordinary in that process, which ended this morning when I was given the first of 30 days of
suboxone. I will personally thank everyone on the outside who has helped me and this movement
particularly at this critical time, when I have regained the freedom that I did nothing to lose. For now,
and until that time, it is war, on paper as always, but war.

Postscript-

         [redacted], if you are able to relay this message to the Anons, my ProjectPM people, journalists,
etc, you will have done me a finer deed than most men ever have occasion to do for another. I am
transmitting a copy of this to another individual to ensure that the FBI does not manage to silence me
on this (incidentally, the local jail here in Mansfield has proven to be run by honorable, trustworthy,
even friendly people, but it is nonetheless subject to the Yankee boot (no offense)). Tell journalists, etc
that they may contact [redacted]. My future and that of ProjectPM depends on you and a handful of
others. Thank you for your loyalty at this time. Finally, please include this PS when forwarding and ask
people to see my original search warrant as published on Buzzfeed a few months back. Echelon2.org is
part of the key to this affair, but not all. More to be revealed when all is prepared. Good luck to you.

     Robert J. Portman is a Republican Senator from the state of Ohio. He has made himself a target as
an advocate of the NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act), but we are truly disturbed by the
ludicrous $272,853 he received from special interest groups supporting the NDAA bill that authorizes
the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens on U.S. soil. Robert J. Portman, we plan to make an example of
you.

  Performance Trust Capital Partners Mr Walsh’s highest listed donor hired Capital Hill Consulting Group
to Lobby congress on S.61 in 2009

  http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=49D1F550-E8EC-4EF7-A408-
804E77B79298

  This bill would have assisted homeowners in preventing the loss of their homes due to mortgage
foreclosure. After the Fed handed out trillions in low mortgage rate loans to high risk taking financial
institutions - S.61 was shot down in congress before it ever made it to the floor. Big finance YES - middle
class homeowner - NO. Overall Mr Walsh received over $125,000 from Securities &amp; Investment Firms
and Insurance companies - his largest donors. For a Tea Party populist, he sure likes the banks and the
insurance companies.

  Here’s more on S.61

  http://annlawyer.com/component/content/article/45.html

   The story about his child support issues are well known. Mr Walsh claims that he had low income and
had temporary housing stewardship of one the children during the disputed time. These are facts which
can be easily verified. Did Mr Walsh have a court order to pay - if so did he make the payments?
Apparently he was ordered and did not pay. Mr Walsh can (and is likely) making the argument that the
payments shouldn’t have been as high as they were because of the issues above detailed - he might be
right in that regard. Mr Walsh states that over $2K a month is being automatically garnished from his
account (sad that a sitting US congressman has to be made to pay support via garnishment). It appears
that there was a time that he was either ordered to pay or did not sufficiently have enough overnights
to be considered shared custodial and was assessed the known $117K in arrears. Also, there seems to
be at least once where he failed to appear at a hearing. It appears that he is in process of trying to lower
that assessed figure (if he hasn’t already) while paying off the figure he owes. Usually, when a non-
custodial parent is in arrears a judge will increase the monthly in attempt to accelerate repayment.

  In any event, $117K is a rather large figure to be in arrears for. One has to surmise that for some
period of time Mr Walsh did not make support payments to his ex-wife. Even giving him the benefit of
the doubt the period of time in which he failed to pay support could probably be measured in years.

  If he got a verbal agreement with his ex-wife over support - then it’s his own fault for not getting the
agreement signed and filed with the court. Also if he did make payments outside a state disbursement
unit and failed to save the cancelled checks - that’s also a measure of irresponsibility.

  Any responsible father knows that child support must be paid if you are not the custodial parent.
Whether or not you get along with the mother is not a consideration. I think constituents can
reasonably come to the conclusion that at least for some extended period of time Joe Walsh did not
make child support payments and was a deadbeat dad - verbal agreement or no.

Conyers has come under fire from scientific and taxpayers’ advocacy groups for repeatedly

introducing a bill that would overturn NIH Public Access Policy, and forbid the government

from mandating that federally funded research be made freely available to the public.

Critics assert that Conyers has been influenced by publishing houses who have contributed

****** Bribery conviction of wife, Monica Conyers ******



Conyers’ wife, Monica, a former President pro tempore of the Detroit City Council,

pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit bribery in June 2009. This is punishable

by up to five years in prison; in March 2010 she was sentenced to 37 months imprisonment,

followed by two years supervised probation.
    On June 16, 2009, the United States Attorney’s Office said that two Synagro Technologies

    representatives had named Monica Conyers as the recipient of bribes from the company totaling

    more than $60,000, paid to influence passage of a contract with the City of Detroit. The information

    was gathered during an FBI investigation into political corruption in the city. She was given a

    pre-indictment letter, and offered a plea bargain deal in the case. On June 26, 2009,

    she was charged with conspiring to commit bribery. She pleaded guilty. On March 10, 2010 she was

    sentenced to 37 months in prison, and also received two years of supervised probation. She is
appealing

    the sentence. She began serving her term on September 10, 2010 at a minimum-security camp in

    Alderson, West Virginia

http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=49D1F550-E8EC-4EF7-A408-
804E77B79298 This bill would have assisted homeowners in preventing the loss of their homes due to
mortgage foreclosure. After the Fed handed out trillions in low mortgage rate loans to high risk taking
financial institutions - S.61 was shot down in congress before it ever made it to the floor. Big finance YES
- middle class homeowner - NO. Overall Mr Walsh received over $125,000 from Securities &amp; Investment
Firms and Insurance companies - his largest donors. For a Tea Party populist, he sure likes the banks and
the insurance companies. Here’s more on S.61
http://annlawyer.com/component/content/article/45.html The story about his child support issues are
well known. Mr Walsh claims that he had low income and had temporary housing stewardship of one
the children during the disputed time. These are facts which can be easily verified. Did Mr Walsh have a
court order to pay - if so did he make the payments? Apparently he was ordered and did not pay. Mr
Walsh can (and is likely) making the argument that the payments shouldn’t have been as high as they
were because of the issues above detailed - he might be right in that regard. Mr Walsh states that over
$2K a month is being automatically garnished from his account (sad that a sitting US congressman has to
be made to pay support via garnishment). It appears that there was a time that he was either ordered to
pay or did not sufficiently have enough overnights to be considered shared custodial and was assessed
the known $117K in arrears. Also, there seems to be at least once where he failed to appear at a
hearing. It appears that he is in process of trying to lower that assessed figure (if he hasn’t already) while
paying off the figure he owes. Usually, when a non-custodial parent is in arrears a judge will increase the
monthly in attempt to accelerate repayment. In any event, $117K is a rather large figure to be in arrears
for. One has to surmise that for some period of time Mr Walsh did not make support payments to his ex-
wife. Even giving him the benefit of the doubt the period of time in which he failed to pay support could
probably be measured in years. If he got a verbal agreement with his ex-wife over support - then it’s his
own fault for not getting the agreement signed and filed with the court. Also if he did make payments
outside a state disbursement unit and failed to save the cancelled checks - that’s also a measure of
irresponsibility. Any responsible father knows that child support must be paid if you are not the
custodial parent. Whether or not you get along with the mother is not a consideration. I think
constituents can reasonably come to the conclusion that at least for some extended period of time Joe
Walsh did not make child support payments and was a deadbeat dad - verbal agreement or no.

Copyright controversy ****** Conyers has come under fire from scientific and taxpayers’ advocacy
groups for repeatedly introducing a bill that would overturn NIH Public Access Policy, and forbid the
government from mandating that federally funded research be made freely available to the public.
Critics assert that Conyers has been influenced by publishing houses who have contributed significant
money to Conyers. ****** Bribery conviction of wife, Monica Conyers ****** Conyers’ wife, Monica, a
former President pro tempore of the Detroit City Council, pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit bribery
in June 2009. This is punishable by up to five years in prison; in March 2010 she was sentenced to 37
months imprisonment, followed by two years supervised probation. On June 16, 2009, the United States
Attorney’s Office said that two Synagro Technologies representatives had named Monica Conyers as the
recipient of bribes from the company totaling more than $60,000, paid to influence passage of a
contract with the City of Detroit. The information was gathered during an FBI investigation into political
corruption in the city. She was given a pre-indictment letter, and offered a plea bargain deal in the case.
On June 26, 2009, she was charged with conspiring to commit bribery. She pleaded guilty. On March 10,
2010 she was sentenced to 37 months in prison, and also received two years of supervised probation.
She is appealing the sentence. She began serving her term on September 10, 2010 at a minimum-
security camp in Alderson, West Virginia

@doxcak3 with help from cabincr3w and p0isanon Robert J. Portman is a Republican Senator from the
state of Ohio. He has made himself a target as an advocate of the NDAA (National Defense Authorization
Act), but we are truly disturbed by the ludicrous $272,853 he received from special interest groups
supporting the NDAA bill that authorizes the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens on U.S. soil. Robert J.

to Lobby congress on S.61 in 2009
http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=49D1F550-E8EC-4EF7-A408-
804E77B79298 This bill would have assisted homeowners in preventing the loss of their homes due to
mortgage foreclosure. After the Fed handed out trillions in low mortgage rate loans to high risk taking
financial institutions - S.61 was shot down in congress before it ever made it to the floor. Big finance YES
- middle class homeowner - NO. Overall Mr Walsh received over $125,000 from Securities &amp; Investment
Firms and Insurance companies - his largest donors. For a Tea Party populist, he sure likes the banks and
the insurance companies. Here’s more on S.61
http://annlawyer.com/component/content/article/45.html The story about his child support issues are
well known. Mr Walsh claims that he had low income and had temporary housing stewardship of one
the children during the disputed time. These are facts which can be easily verified. Did Mr Walsh have a
court order to pay - if so did he make the payments? Apparently he was ordered and did not pay. Mr
Walsh can (and is likely) making the argument that the payments shouldn’t have been as high as they
were because of the issues above detailed - he might be right in that regard. Mr Walsh states that over
$2K a month is being automatically garnished from his account (sad that a sitting US congressman has to
be made to pay support via garnishment). It appears that there was a time that he was either ordered to
pay or did not sufficiently have enough overnights to be considered shared custodial and was assessed
the known $117K in arrears. Also, there seems to be at least once where he failed to appear at a
hearing. It appears that he is in process of trying to lower that assessed figure (if he hasn’t already) while
paying off the figure he owes. Usually, when a non-custodial parent is in arrears a judge will increase the
monthly in attempt to accelerate repayment. In any event, $117K is a rather large figure to be in arrears
for. One has to surmise that for some period of time Mr Walsh did not make support payments to his ex-
wife. Even giving him the benefit of the doubt the period of time in which he failed to pay support could
probably be measured in years. If he got a verbal agreement with his ex-wife over support - then it’s his
own fault for not getting the agreement signed and filed with the court. Also if he did make payments
outside a state disbursement unit and failed to save the cancelled checks - that’s also a measure of
irresponsibility. Any responsible father knows that child support must be paid if you are not the
custodial parent. Whether or not you get along with the mother is not a consideration. I think
constituents can reasonably come to the conclusion that at least for some extended period of time Joe
Walsh did not make child support payments and was a deadbeat dad - verbal agreement or no.

Critics assert that Conyers has been influenced by publishing houses who have contributed significant
money to Conyers. ****** Bribery conviction of wife, Monica Conyers ****** Conyers’ wife, Monica, a
former President pro tempore of the Detroit City Council, pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit bribery
in June 2009. This is punishable by up to five years in prison; in March 2010 she was sentenced to 37
months imprisonment, followed by two years supervised probation. On June 16, 2009, the United States
Attorney’s Office said that two Synagro Technologies representatives had named Monica Conyers as the
recipient of bribes from the company totaling more than $60,000, paid to influence passage of a
contract with the City of Detroit. The information was gathered during an FBI investigation into political
corruption in the city. She was given a pre-indictment letter, and offered a plea bargain deal in the case.
On June 26, 2009, she was charged with conspiring to commit bribery. She pleaded guilty. On March 10,
2010 she was sentenced to 37 months in prison, and also received two years of supervised probation.
She is appealing the sentence. She began serving her term on September 10, 2010 at a minimum-
security camp in Alderson, West Virginia

  Robert J. Portman is a Republican Senator from the state of Ohio. He has made himself a target as an
advocate of the NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act), but we are truly disturbed by the ludicrous
$272,853 he received from special interest groups supporting the NDAA bill that authorizes the
indefinite detention of U.S. citizens on U.S. soil. Robert J. Portman, we plan to make an example of you.

Performance Trust Capital Partners Mr Walsh’s highest listed donor hired Capital Hill Consulting Group
to Lobby congress on S.61 in 2009

http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=49D1F550-E8EC-4EF7-A408-
804E77B79298

This bill would have assisted homeowners in preventing the loss of their homes due to mortgage
foreclosure. After the Fed handed out trillions in low mortgage rate loans to high risk taking financial
institutions - S.61 was shot down in congress before it ever made it to the floor. Big finance YES - middle
class homeowner - NO. Overall Mr Walsh received over $125,000 from Securities &amp; Investment Firms
and Insurance companies - his largest donors. For a Tea Party populist, he sure likes the banks and the
insurance companies.

Here’s more on S.61

http://annlawyer.com/component/content/article/45.html

The story about his child support issues are well known. Mr Walsh claims that he had low income and
had temporary housing stewardship of one the children during the disputed time. These are facts which
can be easily verified. Did Mr Walsh have a court order to pay - if so did he make the payments?
Apparently he was ordered and did not pay. Mr Walsh can (and is likely) making the argument that the
payments shouldn’t have been as high as they were because of the issues above detailed - he might be
right in that regard. Mr Walsh states that over $2K a month is being automatically garnished from his
account (sad that a sitting US congressman has to be made to pay support via garnishment). It appears
that there was a time that he was either ordered to pay or did not sufficiently have enough overnights
to be considered shared custodial and was assessed the known $117K in arrears. Also, there seems to
be at least once where he failed to appear at a hearing. It appears that he is in process of trying to lower
that assessed figure (if he hasn’t already) while paying off the figure he owes. Usually, when a non-
custodial parent is in arrears a judge will increase the monthly in attempt to accelerate repayment.

In any event, $117K is a rather large figure to be in arrears for. One has to surmise that for some period
of time Mr Walsh did not make support payments to his ex-wife. Even giving him the benefit of the
doubt the period of time in which he failed to pay support could probably be measured in years.

If he got a verbal agreement with his ex-wife over support - then it’s his own fault for not getting the
agreement signed and filed with the court. Also if he did make payments outside a state disbursement
unit and failed to save the cancelled checks - that’s also a measure of irresponsibility.

Any responsible father knows that child support must be paid if you are not the custodial parent.
Whether or not you get along with the mother is not a consideration. I think constituents can
reasonably come to the conclusion that at least for some extended period of time Joe Walsh did not
make child support payments and was a deadbeat dad - verbal agreement or no.

****** Copyright controversy ******



Conyers has come under fire from scientific and taxpayers’ advocacy groups for repeatedly

introducing a bill that would overturn NIH Public Access Policy, and forbid the government

from mandating that federally funded research be made freely available to the public.

Critics assert that Conyers has been influenced by publishing houses who have contributed

significant money to Conyers.



****** Bribery conviction of wife, Monica Conyers ******



Conyers’ wife, Monica, a former President pro tempore of the Detroit City Council,

pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit bribery in June 2009. This is punishable

by up to five years in prison; in March 2010 she was sentenced to 37 months imprisonment,

followed by two years supervised probation.



On June 16, 2009, the United States Attorney’s Office said that two Synagro Technologies
  representatives had named Monica Conyers as the recipient of bribes from the company totaling

  more than $60,000, paid to influence passage of a contract with the City of Detroit. The information

  was gathered during an FBI investigation into political corruption in the city. She was given a

  pre-indictment letter, and offered a plea bargain deal in the case. On June 26, 2009,

  she was charged with conspiring to commit bribery. She pleaded guilty. On March 10, 2010 she was

  sentenced to 37 months in prison, and also received two years of supervised probation. She is
appealing

  the sentence. She began serving her term on September 10, 2010 at a minimum-security camp in

  Alderson, West Virginia

TITLE:          The C.I.A.&#39;s secret armies in Europe

AUTHOR:                  Jonathan Kwitny

SOURCE:                  The Nation

DATE:           6 April 1992

=====================================================================================
=======================

Eighteen months have passed since the sensational disclosure of Operation Gladio in Italy brought to
light more than a dozen secret armies established in Western Europe by the United States Central
Intelligence Agency at the start of the cold war. The armies were to constitute a &quot;stay-behind network&quot;
to operate behind Soviet lines if the Red Army overran the Continent. After forty years of secrecy, the
discovery of well-armed guerrilla organizations linked to the C.I.A.--even in officially neutral Switzerland,
Sweden and Austria--provoked government inquiries, journalistic exposes and parliamentary debate
[see Daniel Singer, &quot;The Gladiators,&quot; December 10, 1990].



Today, however, public and most private investigations seem to have run out of steam. Although
suspicions persist, evidence so far hasn&#39;t supported initial allegations that the secret armies used their
hidden C.I.A.-supplied caches of weapons and explosives to carry out political violence that killed
civilians.



But an inquiry conducted by InterNation in Europe discovered that the armies did become intertwined
at times in other possible violations of law--conspiracies between the C.I.A. and many Europeans to
keep Communist or militant socialists out of power in governments, labor unions and businesses across
the Continent. Much new evidence of these political manipulations has surfaced because of interest in
the secret armies. The programs, though officially separate, overlapped. As was the case when such
C.I.A. operations were disclosed in the past, however, European authorities, mostly from political parties
the agency was helping, have been disinclined to take action.



It was also learned that secret armies like Gladio and its counterparts in Germany and France at times
got out of control and were used by groups promoting a return to fascism.



Additional research in the United States has revealed many efforts within the C.I.A. over the years to
disband the secret armies on the grounds that they were obsolete or out of control. But the efforts were
stopped by higher U.S. military and intelligence officials. Interviews with dozens of former C.I.A. and
other intelligence officers involved in the armies revealed that agents were ordered to disband the
German and French operations as early as 1953 after a scandal over the C.I.A.&#39;s recruitment of a neo-
Nazi group threatened to expose the German program. But both the French and German groups
continued, at least until recently. Because of the C.I.A.&#39;s practice of compartmentalizing information,
some officers say they believed the programs they worked with had been ended long ago, only to learn
otherwise in 1990.



Lieut. Col. Bernard Legrand, head of the Belgian stay-behind force for seven years until the government
ordered it disbanded after the Gladio scandal, says programs continue covertly in many countries. But
he won&#39;t name them; he says he thinks the armies are still necessary because the Eastern bloc threat
could revive. Civilian authorities in Italy and Belgium say they worry the armies may still be operating
extralegally in their countries.



The C.I.A. says everything about the armies is still classified and it won&#39;t discuss them.



Mark Wyatt, an acting chief of station in Rome in the 1960s who attended a secret C.I.A. training camp
for Gladio soldiers in Sardinia, says he believes the program was valid and important in its early days.
But, he adds, &quot;in the sixties, the danger of Soviet invasion had lessened to the point that the Americans
should have withdrawn. I think this thing should have been stopped long ago.&quot;



&quot;Quite frankly,&quot; he says, the agency wanted to disband the armies and &quot;tried to sell it [the idea] to the
Pentagon. C.I.A. was unable to sell that.&quot; The reason, he says, was political: &quot;The United States had
made a commitment to keep Italy free, which meant being behind the centrist political parties--we&#39;ll
give you funds, we&#39;ll give you logistical support, we&#39;ll give you training to run it [the armies].&quot; The
danger, he says, was that &quot;in Italy, there&#39;s always a number of people that have adventurous ideas. And
when they became aware that there were large numbers of arms buried all over Italy, it could have led
to a coup d&#39;etat.&quot;



Indeed, a coup was attempted in Italy in 1970, and at least one man involved in Gladio acknowledges
supporting it. Col. Amos Spiazzi, a third-generation officer in the regular Italian Army, says he tipped off
coup leaders when he learned the army was about to act against them, but he was acquitted of criminal
charges of participating in the coup. Also, while in the army Colonel Spiazzi selected candidates for
Gladio; he says he was recruited for that job by an older officer he knew. Now he sits for an interview in
his fortresslike home in Padua beside a large Italian flag and in front of a picture of Mussolini giving a
Hitler-like salute.
Soon after the coup attempt, the C.I.A. tried to expand Gladio&#39;s covert role in Italian politics, according
to documents and testimony from former Italian intelligence officials in the Gladio investigation last
year. In 1972, evidence shows, C.I.A. officers Howard (Rocky) Stone, who in 1953 helped run the coup
that brought the Shah to power in Iran, and Michael Sednoui visited Italian intelligence chiefs and urged
them to use Vietnam-style counterinsurgency tactics against Italy&#39;s large Communist Party. Former
intelligence chief Gen. Gerardo Serravalle testified that the C.I.A. men were &quot;very explicit and urgent in
requesting the organization Gladio be a key force in the anti-Communist opposition.&quot;



Investigators have accepted testimony that the Italians turned down Stone and Sednoui, after which the
agency&#39;s training and support role in Gladio diminished somewhat--although American agents continued
to provide money and attend meetings. Calls to Stone&#39;s office in Maryland were not returned. Sednoui
couldn&#39;t be located.



David Whipple, retired head of the C.I.A.&#39;s operations (covert action) branch for Europe, recalls that
through 1979, when he moved to an unrelated assignment, &quot;there were continued meetings, exercises,
something like practice drills.&quot; On first being questioned, Whipple insisted the program was &quot;neither
designed nor used for any domestic purpose,&quot; and that &quot;all this cock and bull about interference in
domestic politics is a political thing from the opposition group in Italy.&quot; But later, Whipple conceded that
after 1960, &quot;the organizations continued because they took on a life of their own inside their own
countries. For the United States to diminish its help for those groups would have indicated a lack of
support. They wanted it. It was a gesture of good will. To justify that militarily, I would be hard pressed
to do it.&quot;



Former C.I.A. officer Victor Marchetti, who held top headquarters staff posts in the 1960s before
quitting to co-write a book about the agency, says, &quot;When I was on the director&#39;s staff, Young Turks like
me wanted to cut this stuff out. You had to replace teams overseas as they got older and died. With the
advent of tactical nuclear weapons it became ridiculous. But operations people kept finding excuses for
keeping them. People became assets in other ways for local station chiefs--a built-in network for any
kind of covert acts we wanted to run.&quot;



Richard Helms, who was Director of Central Intelligence from 1966 to 1973, insists that the programs
were all stopped before he took over as Director. &quot;I had to sign off on all these projects--I would have
known,&quot; he says, adding, &quot;What would be the sense of keeping these operations so long?&quot; Helms&#39;s
assertion is simply untrue. (Helms has lied in the past about agency operations; in 1977, he was fined
$2,000 by a U.S. district court for not testifying accurately to Congress about the C.I.A.&#39;s role in Chile in
the early 1970s.) Former Deputy Director for Intelligence Ray Cline says that when he was station chief
in Bonn from 1966 to 1969, during the Helms era, he recommended to headquarters that the program
be phased out; he says he was later surprised to learn that it hadn&#39;t been.



Retired C.I.A. officer Thomas Polgar, who held the Bonn post after Cline, says he doubted the merit of
the stay-behind programs all along. &quot;These plans were based on the assumption that Soviet forces
would overrun Europe and very kindly stop at the channel and allow us to run the same kind of
operations we were able to run the last years of World War II,&quot; he says. Polgar contends the programs
were coordinated by &quot;a sort of unconventional-warfare planning group&quot; linked to NATO. The link is
disputed in Italy and other countries, where supporters of the stay-behind armies say that parliamentary
endorsement of the NATO treaty made the armies legal; opponents say the coordinating group was
separate from NATO, and therefore the armies were unconstitutional.



At any rate, says Polgar, &quot;they would meet every couple of months in different capitals, have wonderful
lunches and discuss having compatible communications equipment, I.D. procedures, codes, food and, if
the Russians advance, [ways] to overcome bureaucratic barriers to take people across borders. Each
national service did it with varying degrees of intensity. In Italy in the 1970s, some of the people went a
little bit beyond the charter that NATO put down.&quot;



When he became chief of station in Germany in the late 1970s, Polgar recalls, &quot;I don&#39;t think anybody
took this very seriously. It wasn&#39;t an activity to which you necessarily assigned your smartest people. But
stopping something in a bureaucracy is always very difficult. Budgets are involved, jobs, power. I think a
lot of the American taxpayers&#39; money was sunk into the ground, as well as the German taxpayers&#39;
money and Italian taxpayers&#39; money.&quot; How much? &quot;I don&#39;t think anybody could tell you,&quot; Polgar says.
&quot;The national programs were run by the national services. There&#39;s no way the C.I.A. could be asked to
give an accounting of what the Italians did with their caches.&quot;



Polgar claims the stay-behind armies were kept distinct from other C.I.A. operations that intervened in
local politics, although he acknowledges that personnel sometimes overlapped. &quot;If you used a local labor
union to fight the Communists, it is quite possible that you would have asked the same labor leaders
into the stay-behind network,&quot; he says.



Originally, stay-behind armies were built from groups that worked with Allied forces in World War II,
except in Germany and nearby areas of Austria and Italy where former Nazi or Nazi-allied officers were
knowingly recruited. Officials in some countries say the stay-behind idea existed locally before the C.I.A.
became involved. In the late 1940s, European intelligence officials learned of Red Army contingency
plans to sweep across Europe. The likelihood of such an invasion was always debated, but the danger
seemed real enough to be worth protecting against, at least at the beginning.



&quot;It took two years to establish communications with Tito after the Germans took over Yugoslavia,&quot; says
Franklin Lindsay, who worked in that effort during World War II, and who later joined the C.I.A. and
helped initiate the stay-behind programs. &quot;People said, |God, we don&#39;t want that to happen again.&#39;&quot; So,
Lindsay says, it was decided to recruit &quot;a small number of people with radios and codes.&quot; He emphasizes
small. &quot;The more people who were involved, the worse your security would be,&quot; he says. Caches of
weapons were supplied &quot;just for a few people so they could go to the forest and secure themselves.&quot;
The caches contained &quot;maybe a few hundred pounds of explosives to attack a very important target
such as a railway bridge.&quot; Eventually, the armies ranged from about 100 men, the best estimate in
Belgium, to more than 2,000, the best estimate in Italy.



Edward Barnes, a former C.I.A. colleague of Lindsay&#39;s, says, &quot;All kinds of things were stuck away in
remote places, almost anything people would think might be needed,&quot; including gold coins and bicycles,
although Barnes says radio equipment and codes were the top priority. Resisting a Soviet occupation
was the primary motivation, he contends, but he acknowledges that promoting anti-Communist political
activity in the host country &quot;might have been a secondary consideration.&quot;



Members were recruited by Americans. The nationals who were brought in then recruited others, as
troops, as leaders or for a needed skill. The C.I.A. supplied the equipment and the local forces buried or
otherwise hid it, sources agree. Lindsay says most European intelligence officials welcomed C.I.A.
leadership for fear their own governments had been infiltrated by Communist supporters.



The C.I.A.&#39;s stay-behind program in Germany was the first to cause a public scandal. In 1952, West
German police discovered that the C.I.A. was working with a 2,000-member fascist youth group led by
former Nazi officers. Although the nature of the international stay-behind network wasn&#39;t exposed, the
United States was embarrassed by the resulting furor in the German Parliament. It was disclosed that
the C.I.A.-supported group had a blacklist of persons to be &quot;liquidated&quot; as &quot;unreliable&quot; in case of conflict
with the Soviet Union. On the list were not just Communists but leaders of the Social Democratic Party
serving in Parliament, plus socialists and other government officials. Recently declassified documents
obtained by American historian Christopher Simpson reveal a calculated State Department cover-up of
the incident. The United States denied &quot;knowledge of the political activities&quot; and suggested, falsely, that
the program had been ended (an assertion accepted by The New York Times). Other documents
Simpson has unearthed from the Truman era show a detailed program to persuade French and Italian
political allies to harass Communist Party members covertly and deprive them of ordinary jobs and even
normal social welfare benefits. Similar activities were carried out in neutral Austria.



When Gladio exploded late in 1990, there were calls in the German Parliament for an investigation of
the German program. Then the calls were quietly withdrawn. But last year, a newsletter published by
the Austrian Defense Ministry alleged that Germany&#39;s stay-behind program may have suffered a second
scandal, similar to the one in 1952, but one that never became public. The newsletter reported
extraordinary parallels between the location and contents of the buried arms caches of the stay-behind
networks, and weapons storehouses found in 1981 by West German forest workers near the East
German border. Those weapons--rifles, ammunition and grenades--were traced to the military training
of a youth group run by neo-Nazi Heinz Lembke, who was arrested.



At the time, Lembke was portrayed as a crazed extremist training troops secretly in the forest. He had
founded other neo-Nazi youth groups since 1960; at least one had been banned. The day before
Lembke&#39;s scheduled trial, he died in prison and his death was ruled a suicide. The editor of the Austrian
Defense Ministry publication, retired Gen. Franz Freistaetter, says he personally oversaw the article
suggesting Lembke was using stay-behind caches to train his neo-Nazi troops, and believes it, though its
author insisted on anonymity.



In Austria itself, the press has used the Gladio scandal as an excuse to report C.I.A. violations of Austrian
neutrality. Documents obtained by Simpson show that, in 1955, when the Allied occupation of Austria
ended on condition the country would stay neutral, the United States double-crossed the Soviet Union
by insisting on secret U.S.-Austrian agreements making Austria almost a silent partner in NATO in return
for stepped-up U.S. aid.



American taxpayers unwittingly spent up to $10 million a year to arm and fund unionists who opposed
labor groups that were aggressively seeking a larger slice of the national economic pie. One former
C.I.A.-supported unionist, Franz Olah, who eventually became Austria&#39;s Minister of the Interior, told an
Austrian television interviewer last year how he and his group defeated a 1950 general strike by rival
unionists.



&quot;It wasn&#39;t our intention to fight Communism in the Soviet Union,&quot; he said, &quot;but to fight against the
attempts of Communism in our own country. We took weapons. We also had modern plastic explosives,
which were easy to handle. I had a small arsenal of weapons in my office. There must have been a
couple of thousand people working for us.&quot; He told of coordinated armed bands with radio gear in each
of Austria&#39;s nine provinces, and hinted that all the supplies came from his American contacts. &quot;Only very,
very high politicians and some members of the union knew about it,&quot; he said.



Olah declined to tell InterNation whether he was part of a stay-behind unit, or how the weapons and
explosives were used. Eugen Burgstaller, who retired from the C.I.A. in 1979 and spent much of the
1950s in Vienna, says Olah was in other C.I.A. operations but not a stay-behind network.



Retired officer Barnes remembers that while he was in France in 1953, the C.I.A. ordered him to end the
stay-behind program there, but to keep contact with the recruits, who might be used in other ways. He
says he was told that the scandal-scarred program in Germany was also slated to close. Obviously, he
was misinformed.



Barnes says the French program consisted of several dozen men individually recruited by the agency,
each of whom was to build a small network of his own recruits. In all, he says, the C.I.A. &quot;had no record
of how many people would come out of the woodwork. There was no way to calculate that. Those I met
were farmers, townspeople, tradespeople.&quot; Mostly war veterans, they didn&#39;t need much training, he
says. Barnes emphasizes the instability of French politics before de Gaulle, the frequent changes of
prime ministers. &quot;There were probably a lot of Frenchmen who wanted to be ready if something
happened,&quot; he says.



Barnes says he could meet with only about ten C.I.A. recruits. He had to be careful &quot;for fear of blowing
me and blowing them. You couldn&#39;t go out and just say, |Dig this stuff up, Joe.&#39; There were probably all
kinds of things that went awry. Some of those guys didn&#39;t bury things where they said they did.&quot; Still, he
says, he thought he had disbanded the army without the French government&#39;s ever having heard of it.
He hadn&#39;t.



Barnes left France in 1956. Three years later, says Constantin Melnik, then the new security adviser for
the de Gaulle government, he was told about the network--which he says he already knew about--and
was asked to disband it. Melnik, who had just worked six years in France for the RAND Corporation, a
California-based planning contractor for the C.I.A. and the Pentagon, says de Gaulle&#39;s intelligence chief,
Paul Grossin, told him the French government felt threatened by the network, some of whose members
supported a group of generals who were resisting, sometimes violently, de Gaulle&#39;s attempts to
negotiate Algerian independence and end the war there. &quot;Any group with radios and training would be
very dangerous for the security of France,&quot; Melnik says. And so, he says, he disbanded the network. In
fact, according to Remy Calandra, Defense Ministry spokesman for the Mitterrand administration, the
program continued until recently. Calandra denies any misconduct by the secret army in France but says
the program &quot;went out of control in some countries like Belgium and Italy, where it was used as an
opportunity for mobsters or the far right to meet.&quot;



Adm. Pierre Lacoste, who was dismissed as head of the French secret service in 1985 for his role in the
sinking of the Greenpeace protest vessel Rainbow Warrior, still believes that Soviet contingency plans
for invasion justified the program through his term in office. He acknowledges that some &quot;terrorist
actions&quot; against de Gaulle and his Algerian peace plan were carried out by groups that included &quot;a
limited number of people&quot; from the French stay-behind network. But he says that&#39;s the only time it got
political.



The stay-behind networks of officially neutral countries like Switzerland and Sweden distanced
themselves from the C.I.A. by not sending representatives to coordinating council meetings, according
to people who attended. But the programs were parallel. The Swiss Parliament determined that the
secret army there, known as P-26, didn&#39;t violate official neutrality because it worked under a bilateral
security training arrangement with Britain. The Swiss press, however, has observed that P-26 followed
the same pattern as other networks--for example, adopting an expensive new radio system, known as
Harpoon, when it was acquired by the rest of the networks in the 1980s. Opponents call the bilateral
pact with Britain a fig leaf, but the investigation appears closed.



Former C.I.A. officer Paul Garbler confirms that Sweden had a C.I.A.-coached stay-behind program,
created by former Director of Central Intelligence William Colby (who told about it in his 1978 memoirs
without hinting that the program continued past the 1950s). But Garbler says, &quot;I&#39;m not able to talk with
you about it without causing the Swedes a good deal of heartburn.&quot; Garbler, who served two tours of
duty in Sweden, the last ending in 1976, says the Swedish government was a &quot;direct participant,&quot; as
were &quot;local people outside of politics, but of some standing in the country.&quot; He adds, &quot;If it has ended, I
don&#39;t know when it ended.&quot;



Still, what seems to interest European prosecutors most is that investigations haven&#39;t substantiated
charges that stay-behind members masterminded a series of terrorist bombings in Italy and
supermarket shootings in Belgium. Belgian official investigators and journalists say they have discredited
allegations by a prisoner that the supermarket shootings were tied to the stay-behind program.



Senator Libero Gualtieri, the head of the Italian Parliament&#39;s recently completed investigation, says he
thinks that if the committee had been given the full truth, it would &quot;probably&quot; show that some missing
C.I.A.-supplied explosives from Gladio were used in terrorist bombings in Italy. He found records
showing that Gladio had been used for domestic spying, but the examples seemed relatively innocuous.
His staff points out, however, that intelligence agencies were given time to cleanse their files before
having to turn them over. The committee couldn&#39;t find solid evidence of violence or subversion.



Judge Felice Casson of Venice, whose investigation of a 1972 bombing that killed three policemen led to
the discovery of Gladio, says he&#39;s still investigating. So are military prosecutors. But charges that Judge
Casson brought against two former intelligence chiefs last year over their involvement in Gladio were
recently thrown out in Rome by senior prosecutors, who rebuked Casson for filing them.



Pending unexpected new evidence of violence, the stay-behind matter seems closed--not because there
was no wrong-doing but because most people are satisfied with the outcome of the cold war and aren&#39;t
inclined to open old wounds over politics. Many Socialist and Communist politicians who think their
parties were illegally deprived of power would still like to see justice done and the truth uncovered.
Some journalists and historians, naturally eager to solve mysteries, would like to see an all-European
official probe.



But the predominant reaction right now seems to be that of Roberto Cicciomessere, a parliamentarian
from Italy&#39;s Radical Party. A year ago, Cicciomessere says, he was eager to undertake his assignment on
the committee investigating Gladio. Like Judge Casson, he suspected a great scandal. But having looked
at what he found, and reflecting on the defeat of Communism, Cicciomessere has turned 180 degrees. &quot;I
think Gladio was a good thing,&quot; he says.

“There is already conjecture that James Holmes may have been involved in mind-altering neuroscience
research”



http://cryptogon.com/?p=30455
Where Did Robert Holmes, Father of James Holmes, Work Before 2000?



I would be interested in knowing where Robert Milton Holmes, the father of James Holmes, worked
before 2000. If anyone has this information, please send it to me.



On his Linkedin profile Robert Holmes lists a University of California, Berkeley Ph.D. in Statistics from
1981. He currently works for FICO, but also lists working for HNC Software from 2000 to 2002. (HNC
Software was acquired by FICO.)



We have a DARPA link in HNC Software.



This is from a 1999 company profile for HNC Software:



HNC Software Inc. is San Diego’s largest software company and develops predictive software solutions
for business-to-consumer service companies. These solutions allow companies to make more intelligent
and profitable decisions and are marketed to industries- including financial, insurance, retail,
telecommunications and the Internet.



Like many San Diego-based software companies, HNC Software Inc. traces its origins to the defense
industry. When the company was launched in 1986, it focused on defense-related research and
development. But over the years as defense budgets shrank not only in San Diego, but nationwide, HNC
quickly realized that in order to succeed and grow, other commercial applications had to be found for its
products.



…



But perhaps the most exciting frontier awaiting exploration and commercial development by HNC is in
an area that scientists still know very little about: the human brain. HNC is working on a long-term
research project launched in 1998 that is jointly funded by HNC and the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA), part of the U.S. Defense Department, to investigate ‘cortronic neural
networks,’ a concept originally proposed by Robert Hecht-Nielsen, HNC’s co-founder and chief scientist.
HNC hopes to develop new capabilities in the areas of textual, aural and visual representation, and to
actually build three new predictive, neural-net based systems: one that reads, interprets and searches
text more effectively; a second recognizing speech and other sounds, enabling users to perform audio
searches; and a third that can scan for and interpret images. The ultimate goal is to integrate all three
systems. The net result – machines that someday might be able to reason like humans.



“This is the most important scientific challenge of our time, and finding the answer will be the adventure
of the millennium,” says Hecht-Nielsen.

James Holmes: Accused Colorado Shooter Is Grandson of Decorated Veteran, Has Mamily Roots in
Monterey County



Via: Contra Costa Times:



James Holmes, the man believed responsible for killing 12 people Friday during one of the largest mass
shooting in U.S. history, is the grandson of a decorated military veteran who was a respected educator
at prestigious York School in Monterey.



Lt. Col. Robert M. Holmes, who served in the Okinawa campaign during World War II, retired in 1963 as
the last commander of the Nike missile group in San Francisco Bay. He was one of the first Turkish
language students at the Army Language School, now the Defense Language Institute, graduating in
1948, a school spokesman confirmed Friday.



After his military retirement, Holmes taught math and science at York School for 17 years. He died in
1990. His wife, Mary Jane Crawford Holmes, attended Stanford University and worked at the Monterey
City Library, Fort Ord Library and Pacific Grove High School before finishing her career as librarian and
college counselor at York School. She died in 2010.
A 1945 graduate of Pacific Grove High School, she was also a member of numerous historical societies,
including the Order of the Crown of Charlemagne, Descendants of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery
Company of Boston and the Monterey Bay Colony of Mayflower Descendants, of which she served as
governor.



Their personal histories, taken from their obituaries in The Monterey County Herald, are difficult to
reconcile with the most indelible image of their 24-year-old grandson.

Flashback 2005: CIA Plans to Shift Work to Denver



Via: Washington Post:



The CIA has plans to relocate the headquarters of its domestic division, which is responsible for
operations and recruitment in the United States, from the CIA’s Langley headquarters to Denver, a move
designed to promote innovation, according to U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials.



About $20 million has been tentatively budgeted to relocate employees of the CIA’s National Resources
Division, officials said. A U.S. intelligence official said the planned move, confirmed by three other
government officials, was being undertaken “for operational reasons.”
A CIA spokesman declined to comment. Other current and former intelligence officials said the Denver
relocation reflects the desire of CIA Director Porter J. Goss to develop new ways to operate under cover,
including setting up more front corporations and working closer with established international firms.

Update: “I am The Joker”



Via: AP:



Holmes was studying neuroscience in a Ph.D. program at the University of Colorado-Denver, university
spokeswoman Jacque Montgomery said. Holmes enrolled a year ago and was in the process of
withdrawing at the time of the shootings, Montgomery said.



ABC News reported that Holmes told police “I am the Joker,” according to NYPD police commissioner
Ray Kelly. The report also says Holmes had died his hair like The Joker.



—End Update—



Via: CNN:



The man suspected of shooting up an Aurora, Colorado movie theater screening the new Batman film
early Friday, killing 12 and wounding 59, also left his apartment rigged with traps, police said.



“It’s booby trapped with various incindiery and chemical devices and trip wires,” Aurora police chief Dan
Oates said, adding that it could take days to work through the apartment safely.
Five buildings around suspect James E. Holmes’ Aurora apartment were evacuated, Oates said.



Police say Holmes, 24, dressed head-to-toe in protective tactical gear, set off two devices of some kind
before spraying the theater with bullets from an AR-15 rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and at least one of two
.40-caliber handguns police recovered at the scene.



Oates said investigators are confident that Holmes acted alone.



The shooting unfolded inside a darkened theater packed with Batman fans, some in costume for the
premiere of the movie “The Dark Knight Rises.” Screaming, panicked moviegoers scrambled to escape
from the black-clad gunman, who wore a gas mask and randomly shot as he walked up the theater’s
steps, witnesses said.



It was a scene “straight out of a horror film,” said Chris Ramos, who was inside the theater.



“He was just literally shooting everyone, like hunting season,” Ramos said.



Holmes surrendered without resistance within minutes of the first calls from panicked moviegoers
reporting a shooting inside the Century 16 theater, Oates said. He is scheduled to appear in court on
Monday, court officials said.
