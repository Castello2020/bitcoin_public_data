Podcast Archives Note: In order to help cover costs, all podcasts older than 3 months are listed in the “Podcast Archive” and are available for play/download for supporting members and friends only. Each account is allowed up to 10 separate IP address log ins. This means that if you only use 1 of the 10, 9 friends and family members may share your account and use the other available 9 IP addresses (you may also use them for work, on your tablet, at home, etc.). If you and your family and friends pitch in, that’s only $1.50 each for 1 week’s access. However, if more than 10 different locations are used, your account will be locked for 24 hours. This means that you’ll lose 1 full day from your membership. Thanks for understanding, and for your support!
For FREE registration WITHOUT access to the podcast archives, go here.
