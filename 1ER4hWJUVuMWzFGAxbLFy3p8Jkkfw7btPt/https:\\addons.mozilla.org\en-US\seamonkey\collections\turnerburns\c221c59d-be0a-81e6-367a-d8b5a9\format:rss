To do this the extension provides multi-extension installation support, hacking capabilities to the Extension/Theme manager windows, features to find and troubleshoot Extensions/Themes Build, GUID and Profile information.

Note: With Toolkit 6.0 Auto Archiving is fully working in Firefox 2.0 and temporarily disabled for Firefox 3.0, fix coming soon.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mrtech</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2009 05:07:09 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/seamonkey/addon/mr-tech-toolkit/versions/6.0.4</guid></item><item><title>Multiple Tab Handler 0.7.2014050101</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/seamonkey/addon/multiple-tab-handler/</link><description>This provides features to handle multiple tabs at once, for example, close them, reload them, and so on. When you press the mouse button and dragging over tabs, they will be selected. (Note: The tab will be just moved, if you move the mouse quickly. To start selection, you have to keep the button pressed and wait for a while.) After you release the button, the popup to choose command will be shown. Of course, you can toggle selection by Ctrl-click on each tab and call features from the context menu. Yes, the behavior looks like Excel.

Buit-in features for selected tabs:
 * Close selected tabs
 * Close not-selected tabs
 * Reload selected tabs
 * Duplicate selected tabs
 * Pin/unpin selected tabs (Minefield/Firefox 4)
 * Move selected tabs to a group (Minefield/Firefox 4)
 * Move selected tabs to a new window
 * Bookmark selected tabs
 * Copy URIs/titles+URIs/HTML links for selected tabs to the clipboard
 * Save (download) selected tabs to the local disk
 * Print selected tabs (require Print All Tabs: &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/e50cbefd602a410c826572c493ccfbd1af70eb5f/https%3A//addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/5142" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/5142&lt;/a&gt; )

You can customize the tab selection menu by Menu Editor ( &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/d721ca2a1041d67304f5a36ba59486a5ba2f29c1/https%3A//addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/710" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/710&lt;/a&gt; ).

Extra features for general tab context menu:
 * Close right tabs
 * Close left tabs
 * Close all tabs include the selected tab
 * Close similar tabs (same domain) exclude the selected tab

You can move tabs with drag and drop if you start to drag on a tab after you press the mouse button immediately. Multiple tabs can be dragged and moved if you select multiple tabs by Ctrl-click or Shift-click before you start to drag.

This emulates some features of "iRider". Selecting of closeboxes can close tabs directly, and you can switch tabs by dragging on tabs. (require configuration)

Its purpose is to capture video and image files from many sites.

Just surf the Web as you are used to, when DownloadHelper detects it can do something for you, the icon gets animated and a menu allows you to download files by simply clicking an item

For instance, if you go to a YouTube page, you'll be able to download the video directly on your file system. It also works with MySpace, Google videos, DailyMotion, Porkolt, iFilm, DreamHost and others.

Since version 3.1, you can setup the extension to automatically convert the downloaded movies to your preferred video format.

When you are on a page containing links to images or movies, you can download some or all of them at once. Moving the mouse over the items in the menu will highlights the links directly in the page to make sure they are the ones you want to pick up.

DownloadHelper also allows you to download files one by one, so that you keep bandwidth to surf for other stuff to download.

To modify your preferences, like changing the download directory, right-click on the icon and choose "Preferences".

When you first install the extension, your browser is redirected to a welcome page with links to a user manual at &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/e082e7b841234b6e9644f79460f464b8d338595bcef88dbb579e7509468e9597/http%3A//www.downloadhelper.net/manual.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.downloadhelper.net/manual.php&lt;/a&gt; and a faq at &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/a9aec9bd66992a22e36edce6354da4913b8beccafd3ed78ca9146139da2e7c39/http%3A//www.downloadhelper.net/faq.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.downloadhelper.net/faq.php&lt;/a&gt;

This does not change your homepage setting and the welcome page won't appear anymore.

***********************

If you are having problems downloading videos from YouTube, please check this link: &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/79ecd542f674c3b5356a5a4fd1428e8d236ef393c491a5d2e0b8afe7aaeea343/http%3A//bugzilla.downloadhelper.net%3A8080/show_bug.cgi%3Fid=536" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://bugzilla.downloadhelper.net:8080/show_bug.cgi?id=536&lt;/a&gt;

UPDATE July 19th 2013: 

For today's youtube changes, please follow this procedure for downloading videos that currently generate empty files:

- Open url "about:config"
- Create a new parameter called "&lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/b179516455d41c6755348b4a30324c71c3078317d69c6de569b67f0811808547/http%3A//dwhelper.yt" rel="nofollow"&gt;dwhelper.yt&lt;/a&gt;-sig-perm-85" of type String
- Set its value to "[[2,8],[0,1],[9,21],[65,66],[22,65],[84,85],[66,82],[21,22]]"
(without the quotes).
- Reload the youtube page (no need to restart Firefox) and you should be done.

UPDATE July 22nd 2013: 

4.9.18 is waiting for approval at Mozilla. This version automatically adapts to YouTube signature changes (responsible for empty downloads) and fixes a few bugs like video variant ordering and removal of audioless or videoless variants.

UPDATE July 24th 2013:

YouTube changed their signature last night.

Version 4.9.19 is waiting for approval at &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/versions/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/versions/&lt;/a&gt;

Note that since 4.9.18, Video DownloadHelper automatically learns the new signatures, but your first downloads just after a signature change may fail. Just reload the YouTube video page, wait for the video to start playing after the ad and retry downloading a few times (generally 1 to 4 attempts are enough to generate the signature).

UPDATE July 26th 2013:

YouTube changed their signature permutation method again last night.

4.9.19 and 4.9.20 has been removed from the Mozilla review pool.

Current working version is 4.9.21a1 (soon to be submitted to Mozilla as 4.9.21): &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/7c1cc92101c730f5809cd74abadeae1bce1280cc3cc7b52a595f8e482ed83ee1/http%3A//www.downloadhelper.net/install-beta.php%3Fversion=4.9.21a1" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.downloadhelper.net/install-beta.php?version=4.9.21a1&lt;/a&gt;

WOT simply shows website reputations as traffic lights next to search results when you use Google, Yahoo!, Bing or any other search engine. Icons are also visible next to links in social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and email services like Gmail and Yahoo! Mail, as well as other popular sites like Wikipedia. By clicking the traffic light icon you can find out more information about a website’s reputation and other users’ opinions. A green traffic light means users have rated the site as trusted and reliable, red warns about potential threats and yellow indicates that you need to be cautious when using a site.

WOT ratings and reviews are powered by a global community of millions of users who rate websites based on their personal experiences. In addition, third-party sources are used to warn you about malicious software and other technical threats that you might encounter.

You can share your experiences by rating sites yourself and help make the Internet a safer place for everyone.

WOT has been featured in the New York Times, CNET, PC World, Kim Komando show, Tech Republic, PC Welt and many other popular media.

&lt;b&gt;Wherever you need to click through ads or wait for countdowns, SkipScreen will be there to make your life easier.  SkipScreen automatically clicks through the hoops to get to the content you want.&lt;/b&gt;

SkipScreen will be tenaciously maintained and improving all the time.  We're starting with some of the most popular sites.  But if there's a site whose superfluous pages and delays annoy you, please tell us!

To enable SmartLinks, just accept the SmartLinks Terms of Service when installing SkipScreen. You can later disable or completely remove SmartLinks from the Firefox Tools menu.

Hidden settings Guide:

1- Copy command has two modes,"Copy location bar content" which is the default mode OR "Copy the URL of the current displayed page".

Now here's the trick:
    You can switch the mode on the fly by holding the CTRL key while clicking on the "Copy icon".

example:
    if your location bar contains &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/5dca75bbfaf5db77c9af0cec264f6a85fbf408cd/http%3A//tinyurl.com/1" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/1&lt;/a&gt; and the Real page URL is &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/7a8c66dbb749fbd9c00bb0c99f36d52fec963eba/http%3A//www.somesite.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.somesite.com/&lt;/a&gt;
    using the "default settings" Clicking on the "Copy" icon will give you "&lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/5dca75bbfaf5db77c9af0cec264f6a85fbf408cd/http%3A//tinyurl.com/1" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/1&lt;/a&gt;" but 
    if you hold the CTRL key Clicking on the "Copy" icon will give you "&lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/7a8c66dbb749fbd9c00bb0c99f36d52fec963eba/http%3A//www.somesite.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.somesite.com/&lt;/a&gt;"

Tip:
    You can change the default mode using the settings dialog.

2- Hold the ALT key while clicking on the Copy icon to send the URL using your default email client.

3- Hold the SHIFT key while clicking on the Copy icon to get the formatted URL copied to clipboard.

4- Hold the ALT key while clicking on the TinyURL icon to send the shortened URL using your default email client.

5- Hold the CTRL key while clicking on the "Search site" icon to show the search panel.

6- Hold the CTRL key while clicking on the "Go up" icon to navigate to the site root. (or you can simply double click that icon to get the same effect)

7- Hold the CTRL key while clicking on the "Anonymous serf" icon to show the Quick settings panel.

8- Hold the CTRL key while clicking on the "Tag page with these words" context menu item to Tag the page with the selected text without splitting it.

***Note:
if you are using "Redirect Remover" extension then add this filter to its white list,
http://*/index.php?*=ahr0c
 OR 
http://*.*=ahr0c

this will tell "Redirect Remover" not to rewrite proxified links.

One of the most useful features provided by Search Cloudlet is Tag Cloud for search results. Now there is no need to look through results list to understand what it's all about. Tag Cloud will show you all the keywords relevant to your search results. And you can easily narrow your search by clicking keywords on the cloud and adding/removing them to/from your query. It's very simple!

Search Cloudlet offers you to experience Hyperlinks 2.0: click a left part of a tag link to add this tag to your query, click a right part of the tag link to remove it from your query. 

Site Cloud view suggests sites which contain the most relevant information about your search subject. The most important websites are shown with bigger font. To narrow your search to a specific web-site or exclude this site from the search - just click it and it will be added to (or removed from) your query.

If you often use Google or Yahoo to search through news or blogs, then Search Cloudlet is exactly what you need. For News search there is Source Cloud, that can help you determine the key publishers. For Blogs search there is also Author Cloud view. You can use these context-sensitive clouds to narrow your search the same way you would do it with tag clouds.

Search Cloudlet offers full organic integration of cloud-based navigation into all Twitter functionality. After installing Search Cloudlet, users get tag clouds inserted into their Twitter home-pages, search pages, profile pages, favorites and even into public timeline. Also, on top of traditional simple tag clouds, Cloudlet adds various context-sensitive clouds, such as Author Clouds, Recipient Clouds and Hashtag Clouds.

If you want to work some time with classical Google / Yahoo / Twitter results list without clouds - just click the "Off" button. You can bring back your clouds anytime you want - simply click Tags, Sites or any other button on the Cloudlet's panel. 

To further customize the way Search Cloudlet behaves, go to Firefox menu Tools/Add-ons/Extensions/SearchCloudlet/Options and set your preferences.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">INTSPEI Cloudlet Team</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 13 Sep 2009 16:57:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/seamonkey/addon/search-cloudlet-for-google-yah/versions/0.7.4.75</guid></item><item><title>Microsoft .NET Framework Assistant 1.3.1</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/seamonkey/addon/microsoft-net-framework-assist/</link><description>This extension requires version 3.5 SP1 (or greater) of the .NET Framework to be installed and is the only official extension published by Microsoft to support ClickOnce.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Microsoft Corporation</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2011 16:48:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/seamonkey/addon/microsoft-net-framework-assist/versions/1.3.1</guid></item></channel></rss>
