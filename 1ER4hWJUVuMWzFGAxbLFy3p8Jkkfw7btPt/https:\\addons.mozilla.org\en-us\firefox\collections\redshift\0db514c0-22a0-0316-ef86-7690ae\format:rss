&lt;b&gt;Wherever you need to click through ads or wait for countdowns, SkipScreen will be there to make your life easier.  SkipScreen automatically clicks through the hoops to get to the content you want.&lt;/b&gt;

SkipScreen will be tenaciously maintained and improving all the time.  We're starting with some of the most popular sites.  But if there's a site whose superfluous pages and delays annoy you, please tell us!

&lt;em&gt;SkipScreen includes the 'SmartLinks' functionality. SmartLinks helps you discover new things by automatically inserting relevant links to interesting content. SmartLinks is completely anonymous, and does not collect nor transmit and personally identifiable information.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Please note: This feature is opt-in only, and is not required to run SkipScreen.&lt;/b&gt;

To enable SmartLinks, just accept the SmartLinks Terms of Service when installing SkipScreen. You can later disable or completely remove SmartLinks from the Firefox Tools menu. Learn more about SmartLinks at &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/d373d3ab64f83c0c19f224dd8e630f6420dc7813/http%3A//skipscreen.getsmartlinks.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://skipscreen.getsmartlinks.com&lt;/a&gt;

Hi everyone,

I know, I know, it needs to be done.  The Australis changes have been a huge amount of work.  Sorry it's not ready yet, but it is coming.

The beta is usable if rough-edged, if you want to try that: &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/62e1149a7fcd2bd0d02403546d8a28188ad57d7403bda57ce200c8d721ece3d8/http%3A//mcdavis.dreamhosters.com/nnlopenbeta/index.html"&gt;beta builds are here&lt;/a&gt;, and watch &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/563bafec16965c79274613b496591b9c7da8c5e757cf4bad4cd4d8bea6cf922e/http%3A//mcdavis.dreamhosters.com/nnlopenbeta/feed.xml"&gt;the feed for announcements of new betas&lt;/a&gt;, or follow along on the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/35188151d07b7f19668d45c25ae92948f28ec381d9f18aeab01ff273dc5d05d8/http%3A//forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php%3Ft=547498"&gt;NNL support forum&lt;/a&gt;.

I've been working on it close to every spare waking moment since I released the previous update for Firefox 28, and that'll continue until it's ready.  I've had many, many people asking where the heck their theme is; I'm just as eager for it to be done as you all are.

I'll leave you with a couple quotes, then get back to work.

From Jim Jarmusch's &lt;i&gt;Night on Earth&lt;/i&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I'm sorry I sound calm, I assure you I'm hysterical. I'll call you the MINUTE I know ANYTHING."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and from Fred Brooks' &lt;i&gt;Mythical Man-Month&lt;/i&gt;:

The add-on is supported by over forty filter subscriptions in dozens of languages which automatically configure it for purposes ranging from removing online advertising to blocking all known malware domains. Adblock Plus also allows you to customize your filters with the assistance of a variety of useful features, including a context option for images, a block tab for Flash and Java objects, and a list of blockable items to remove scripts and stylesheets.

Starting with Adblock Plus 2.0 there is an option in Filter Preferences to allow some non-intrusive advertising. The goal is to support websites using non-intrusive ways to advertise and to encourage more websites to do the same. &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/1562af6ef7d30389889449d42850bac00b0ce14e/http%3A//adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads" rel="nofollow"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Wladimir Palant</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2014 09:33:12 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/versions/2.6.3</guid></item><item><title>Add N Edit Cookies 1.0.0.2</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/add-n-edit-cookies-13793/</link><description>This add-on was originally a Firefox add-on by goodwill,  however it was incompatible with firefox 3.5 (the latest version at the time). I have edited it (I hope goodwill doesn't mind) and will continue to edit it to be compatible with whatever the current version of Firefox is.

If the website takes you to a download for version 0.1.1.6, just know that that version was a &lt;b&gt;beta test&lt;/b&gt; (sorry, Mozilla) &lt;b&gt;for version 1.0.0.2 and will not work. However, version 1.0.0.2 will.&lt;/b&gt;

Also, some users may need to enable 3rd party cookies. Or so says one of the reviewers.

ALSO NOTE: V@NO updated goodwill's addon and did a much better job than me, even added more features. You can choose between downloading my version or his version. To get his, do an addon search for "Add N Edit cookies", go to goodwill's, go on his profile, and click V@NO's version (0.3)
As you can see, I'm just trying to present you with any options you may prefer.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Arightwizard</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 Apr 2010 16:35:59 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/add-n-edit-cookies-13793/versions/1.0.0.2</guid></item><item><title>Aardvark 3.0</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/aardvark/</link><description>Powerful and user-friendly selector utility for selecting elements and doing various actions on them.  It can be used for cleaning up a page prior to printing it (by removing and isolating elements), for making the page more readable, and (most appreciated by web developers), for analyzing the structure of a page.

To use Aardvark, just right-click on the page and select Start Aardvark from the popup menu.  As you move the mouse over the page, you will see a red rectangle around the current block element, along with a label showing its type, and if they exist, its id, class, and style.  You can then press various keys on the keyboard to do things, for instance W to navigate wider (as shown in the image), R to remove the element, I to isolate the element (that is, remove everything else on the page), V to view formatted source of that element, U to undo, Q to quit aardvark, and H for help, that is, a list of the 14 or so available keystrokes.

There is now an extremely powerful new command for Javascript developers, that generates DOM code by selecting an element on a web page (such as your html mockup).  See the web site for documentation.  Also on the web site is a &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/aebdf815c36925a416f5587e31cabefdd14dab06/http%3A//karmatics.com/aardvark/bookmarklet.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;bookmarklet version of Aardvark&lt;/a&gt; that works on Safari and Chrome (quite well) and IE (not quite so well...).</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Rob Brown</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2010 17:40:33 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/aardvark/versions/3.0</guid></item><item><title>ANTHEM 1.6</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/anthem/</link><description>Thanks to all the millions of people who downloaded, commented and donated to this theme. 

At this point in my career I do not have time to work on this theme for future versions of Firefox. If you would like to help out and get it working on newer versions you can fork the source code here: &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/a441ff2e68c7dfd1c2965628ae3471f07a6f0836/https%3A//github.com/wesleyhales/ANTHEM" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://github.com/wesleyhales/ANTHEM&lt;/a&gt;
Send me a pull request and we will get a new release out there.

Thanks!</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">wesleyhales</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2009 09:16:15 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/anthem/versions/1.6</guid></item></channel></rss>
