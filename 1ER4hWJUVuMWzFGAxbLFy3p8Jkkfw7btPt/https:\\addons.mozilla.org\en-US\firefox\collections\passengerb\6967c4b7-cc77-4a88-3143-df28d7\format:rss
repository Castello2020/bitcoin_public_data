Try &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/fxchrome/" rel="nofollow"&gt;FXChrome&lt;/a&gt; instead.

&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Due to lack of resources and support, Chromifox Basic is no longer being developed. There will be no more updates to this theme for Firefox 4.0 or later. I'm sorry for any inconvenience.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Basic vs. Extreme&lt;/strong&gt;
There are 2 different themes called Chromifox. You’re checking out Basic. &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10674" rel="nofollow"&gt;Go see Chromifox Extreme...&lt;/a&gt;

WOT simply shows website reputations as traffic lights next to search results when you use Google, Yahoo!, Bing or any other search engine. Icons are also visible next to links in social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and email services like Gmail and Yahoo! Mail, as well as other popular sites like Wikipedia. By clicking the traffic light icon you can find out more information about a website’s reputation and other users’ opinions. A green traffic light means users have rated the site as trusted and reliable, red warns about potential threats and yellow indicates that you need to be cautious when using a site.

WOT ratings and reviews are powered by a global community of millions of users who rate websites based on their personal experiences. In addition, third-party sources are used to warn you about malicious software and other technical threats that you might encounter.

You can share your experiences by rating sites yourself and help make the Internet a safer place for everyone.

WOT has been featured in the New York Times, CNET, PC World, Kim Komando show, Tech Republic, PC Welt and many other popular media.

You can show/hide any icon you don't need using the settings dialog.

some video's on how to use this extension are located here:
&lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/aeaed9b4c7f73e0d2836ff5675eaa54a52a59fd0/http%3A//www.youtube.com/UrlbarExt" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/UrlbarExt&lt;/a&gt; 


Hidden settings Guide:

1- Copy command has two modes,"Copy location bar content" which is the default mode OR "Copy the URL of the current displayed page".

Now here's the trick:
    You can switch the mode on the fly by holding the CTRL key while clicking on the "Copy icon".

example:
    if your location bar contains &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/5dca75bbfaf5db77c9af0cec264f6a85fbf408cd/http%3A//tinyurl.com/1" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/1&lt;/a&gt; and the Real page URL is &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/7a8c66dbb749fbd9c00bb0c99f36d52fec963eba/http%3A//www.somesite.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.somesite.com/&lt;/a&gt;
    using the "default settings" Clicking on the "Copy" icon will give you "&lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/5dca75bbfaf5db77c9af0cec264f6a85fbf408cd/http%3A//tinyurl.com/1" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/1&lt;/a&gt;" but 
    if you hold the CTRL key Clicking on the "Copy" icon will give you "&lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/7a8c66dbb749fbd9c00bb0c99f36d52fec963eba/http%3A//www.somesite.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.somesite.com/&lt;/a&gt;"

Tip:
    You can change the default mode using the settings dialog.

2- Hold the ALT key while clicking on the Copy icon to send the URL using your default email client.

3- Hold the SHIFT key while clicking on the Copy icon to get the formatted URL copied to clipboard.

4- Hold the ALT key while clicking on the TinyURL icon to send the shortened URL using your default email client.

5- Hold the CTRL key while clicking on the "Search site" icon to show the search panel.

6- Hold the CTRL key while clicking on the "Go up" icon to navigate to the site root. (or you can simply double click that icon to get the same effect)

7- Hold the CTRL key while clicking on the "Anonymous serf" icon to show the Quick settings panel.

8- Hold the CTRL key while clicking on the "Tag page with these words" context menu item to Tag the page with the selected text without splitting it.

***Note:
if you are using "Redirect Remover" extension then add this filter to its white list,
http://*/index.php?*=ahr0c
 OR 
http://*.*=ahr0c

this will tell "Redirect Remover" not to rewrite proxified links.

You can even use user styles as themes on the interface of Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey themselves.

Stylish lets you easily manage user styles. Add, delete, enable, disable, and organize with a few clicks of a mouse, no code to edit, no obscure configuration to find.

What it does is temporarily disable the following:
- Browsing History (also in Address bar)
- Cookies
- Downloaded Files History
- Disk Cache
- Saved Form Information
- Sending of ReferrerHeader
- Recently Closed Tabs list

None of the affected options gets cleared totally as opposed to some other extensions which enable you to wipe these privacy issues with a single click, but at the same time leaving you without the history of your frequently visited websites.

Usage:
- [Tools / Stealther] menu option
- Toolbar button
- Statusbar icon (thank you Dreadnaut)
- [Ctrl+Shift+S] keyboard shortcut (customizable)

Options are available through Addons/Extensions.

&lt;b&gt;Wherever you need to click through ads or wait for countdowns, SkipScreen will be there to make your life easier.  SkipScreen automatically clicks through the hoops to get to the content you want.&lt;/b&gt;

SkipScreen will be tenaciously maintained and improving all the time.  We're starting with some of the most popular sites.  But if there's a site whose superfluous pages and delays annoy you, please tell us!

&lt;em&gt;SkipScreen includes the 'SmartLinks' functionality. SmartLinks helps you discover new things by automatically inserting relevant links to interesting content. SmartLinks is completely anonymous, and does not collect nor transmit and personally identifiable information.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Please note: This feature is opt-in only, and is not required to run SkipScreen.&lt;/b&gt;

To enable SmartLinks, just accept the SmartLinks Terms of Service when installing SkipScreen. You can later disable or completely remove SmartLinks from the Firefox Tools menu. Learn more about SmartLinks at &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/d373d3ab64f83c0c19f224dd8e630f6420dc7813/http%3A//skipscreen.getsmartlinks.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://skipscreen.getsmartlinks.com&lt;/a&gt;

If so, you need Lazarus. If not, install it anyway, before disaster strikes! 

Lazarus securely saves forms as you type, allowing you to safely recover your lost work after server timeouts, network issues, browser crashes, power failures, and all the other things that can go wrong while you're entering forms, editing content, writing webmail, etc, etc, etc...

Lazarus works on ordinary web forms, WYSIWYG editors,  and even AJAXified comment boxes, and will save you from pretty much any given server, browser, or connection problems that might otherwise cause you to lose your work, or that really pithy blog comment you struggled on for over an hour. 

Lazarus 2.3 uses RSA and AES hybrid encryption, so your form history is more private and secure than ever! Lazarus also includes search functionality so you can recover text even if you can no longer find the original form you entered it into.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Seth Wagoner</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2011 22:31:53 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lazarus-form-recovery/versions/2.3</guid></item><item><title>IE View Lite 1.3.5</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ie-view-lite/</link><description>------------------------------
PLEASE NOTE
------------------------------
When the release notes for 1.3.2 said that it broke compatibility with Firefox 3, I wasn't joking. That is why 1.3.3 can only be installed on Firefox 3. If you could install it, not all functionality would work. When the release notes for 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 say that they only make compatibility updates for Firefox 3, I'm not joking. The only difference between 1.3.3 and 1.3.1 is that 1.3.3 works only on Firefox 3, and 1.3.1 only works on Firefox 2 and before. If you want to use IE View Lite on Firefox 2 or earlier, you can download 1.3.1 under "Complete Version History".
------------------------------

This is a cut down version of IE View by Paul Roub, which is 47.4 KB. All the same UI and features are there. It has a right click menu item to open a page in IE and a list of sites to always open in IE. It can close tabs automatically and send additional parameters to the executable. Everything's just been rebuilt from the ground up to be smaller and more efficient.

It works on Windows, Linux, and now Mac (I think).

For Linux, put wine as the path and the location of IE as the parameter.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Grayson Mixon</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 13 Sep 2009 17:04:06 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ie-view-lite/versions/1.3.5</guid></item><item><title>Greasemonkey 1.15</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/</link><description>Allows you to customize the way a web page displays or behaves, by using small bits of JavaScript.
