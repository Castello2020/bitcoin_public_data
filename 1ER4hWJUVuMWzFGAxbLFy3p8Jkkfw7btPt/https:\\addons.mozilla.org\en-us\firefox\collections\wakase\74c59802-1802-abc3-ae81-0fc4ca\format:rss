WOT simply shows website reputations as traffic lights next to search results when you use Google, Yahoo!, Bing or any other search engine. Icons are also visible next to links in social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and email services like Gmail and Yahoo! Mail, as well as other popular sites like Wikipedia. By clicking the traffic light icon you can find out more information about a website’s reputation and other users’ opinions. A green traffic light means users have rated the site as trusted and reliable, red warns about potential threats and yellow indicates that you need to be cautious when using a site.

WOT ratings and reviews are powered by a global community of millions of users who rate websites based on their personal experiences. In addition, third-party sources are used to warn you about malicious software and other technical threats that you might encounter.

You can share your experiences by rating sites yourself and help make the Internet a safer place for everyone.

WOT has been featured in the New York Times, CNET, PC World, Kim Komando show, Tech Republic, PC Welt and many other popular media.

This file can be used to install or restore a collection of extensions and/or themes.  

You may have a list of your favorite extensions/themes that you would like to share with others. With CLEO, you can gather them all together into a single file (called, perhaps, "My favorite add-ons") and post it on a webpage or email it to family, friends and co-workers. They can install the whole batch with a just a couple of clicks!  (e.g., File &amp;gt; Open File…)

Useful tool for developers:  I, as an extension developer, have several different Firefox profiles. Whenever I start a new extension, I create a new profile for testing, debugging, etc. In this profile, I like to have a dozen or so developer related extensions installed. With CLEO, I can package all these extensions together and install them into a new profile with just a few clicks.

Once installed, CLEO is available from the Firefox Tools menu under the FEBE* submenu. (FEBE must be installed for CLEO to work.)

Without this extension, when you discover an URI text not linked, like "&lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/de3a4d2fa42d0578d9fa2f6f9438b052759f2384/http%3A//piro.sakura.ne.jp/"&gt;http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/&lt;/a&gt;", you have to do following steps to load the page:

 1. Select the URI text completely. (It may be a hard work if the page is rendered with a propotional font. This operation always chafes me.)
 2. Copy it. (press "Ctrl-C" or use "Copy" from the "Edit" menu)
 3. Paste it to the location bar.
 4. Press "Enter". Then, Firefox loads it.

or,

 1. Select the URI text completely. (It chafes me again!)
 2. Drag the selection string to the tab bar and drop it. Then, Firefox loads it.

With this extension, you can load the URI only following one step:

 1. Double-click on the URI text. Then, Firefox loads it. I'm happy.

For example, if you type google.con, it will correct it to &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/105ab463e59c21c54f68a28f8c587f40731596c2/http%3A//google.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;google.com&lt;/a&gt; (asking first, if you enable confirmation).

This version will correct common misspellings of .com, .net, .org, .edu, .gov, .mil, and all other mainstream TLDs, as well as the protocol (http:, https:).  By right-clicking on the address bar, you can set it to auto-correct your errors, or you can have it ask you before making any corrections.

You can specify your own set of custom corrections. Add or remove your own corrections in URL Fixer's options dialog, accessible via Tools » Add-ons » URL Fixer » Preferences.

You can also correct errors as they happen; if Firefox can't find the website you typed in, URL Fixer lets you mark that URL as a typo, and you'll never see that error page again.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Wladimir Palant</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Oct 2012 20:20:01 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/url-fixer/versions/4.1</guid></item><item><title>YesScript 2.0</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/yesscript/</link><description>YesScript lets you make a blacklist of sites that aren't allowed to run JavaScript. Use YesScript on sites that annoy you or hog your system resources. One click to the icon in the status bar turns scripts on or off for the current site.

Unlike NoScript, YesScript does absolutely nothing to improve your security. I believe that Firefox is secure enough by default and that blocking all scripts by default is paranoia. YesScript strives to remove hassles from your browsing experience, rather than add them.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jason Barnabe</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 21:53:14 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/yesscript/versions/2.0</guid></item><item><title>Yet Another Smooth Scrolling 3.1.7</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/yet-another-smooth-scrolling/</link><description>With this extension, you can customize smooth scrolling behavior. 
The extension is worth to use, if you are frustrated at any of below.
- Step size for scrolling by the cursor keys is so short.
- A built-in smooth scrolling is somewhat less sensitive and laggy.
- When you flick a wheel so quick, scrolling should move farther but just count ticks of a wheel.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">kataho.</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2013 02:45:11 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/yet-another-smooth-scrolling/versions/3.1.7</guid></item><item><title>新同文堂 (New Tong Wen Tang) 0.4.0.9.1</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/%E6%96%B0%E5%90%8C%E6%96%87%E5%A0%82-new-tong-wen-tang/</link><description>Features:

Just right-click on the page you want to grab and look in the "Screengrab" menu.

It will capture what you can see in the window, the entire page, just a selection, a particular frame... basically it saves webpages as images - either to a file, or to the clipboard.

It can capture any Java or Flash embedded in a page, but to do this it requires Java to be installed in the browser. 

Sadly, there's a bug in 0.96.2 with Firefox 3.6 (due to a deprecated API call - oops!) that causes a crash on any page containing Flash or Applets if you have Java enabled (sort of the reverse of the last major issue). 0.96.3 is finished and waiting for Mozilla approval to be released. That usually takes a few weeks. My sincerest apologies.

The following little keywords are at the request of those who can't remember the name ScreenGrab! and want searches to work. It takes screen shots, screenshots - that is, shots, of web pages.

&lt;b&gt;Wherever you need to click through ads or wait for countdowns, SkipScreen will be there to make your life easier.  SkipScreen automatically clicks through the hoops to get to the content you want.&lt;/b&gt;

SkipScreen will be tenaciously maintained and improving all the time.  We're starting with some of the most popular sites.  But if there's a site whose superfluous pages and delays annoy you, please tell us!

&lt;em&gt;SkipScreen includes the 'SmartLinks' functionality. SmartLinks helps you discover new things by automatically inserting relevant links to interesting content. SmartLinks is completely anonymous, and does not collect nor transmit and personally identifiable information.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Please note: This feature is opt-in only, and is not required to run SkipScreen.&lt;/b&gt;

To enable SmartLinks, just accept the SmartLinks Terms of Service when installing SkipScreen. You can later disable or completely remove SmartLinks from the Firefox Tools menu.

User styles empower your browsing experience by letting you customize web sites. Take out irrelevant content, change colors, or completely redesign the entire site. You can even use user styles as themes on the interface of Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey themselves.

Stylish lets you easily manage user styles. Add, delete, enable, disable, and organize with a few clicks of a mouse, no code to edit, no obscure configuration to find. Stylish's companion website, &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/76374e85d2e814e19408c9d3b3617798bf666a44/http%3A//userstyles.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;userstyles.org&lt;/a&gt;, hosts tens of thousands of user styles made by other Stylish users that you can try.

For you technical types out there, think of it this way: Stylish and &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/76374e85d2e814e19408c9d3b3617798bf666a44/http%3A//userstyles.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;userstyles.org&lt;/a&gt; are to CSS as Greasemonkey and &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/15b9fa0fe1920f09bd1c69eea79f7043cbb8dcb6/http%3A//userscripts.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;userscripts.org&lt;/a&gt; are to JavaScript.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jason Barnabe</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 16:05:46 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/stylish/versions/1.4.3</guid></item></channel></rss>
